there have been at least four confirmed deaths from tropical cyclone phailin amitabh thakor deputy inspector general of brahmapur odisha told cnn
three were killed saturday
a fourth was confirmed dead sunday
local police told cnn's sister network in india cnn ibn that seven people had been killed by falling trees
morning light on sunday revealed some of the damage from tropical cyclone phailin which made landfall on india's eastern coast as the strongest storm to hit india in fourteen years
power lines and trees were down and cars were overturned near the spot where the center of the storm struck the coast around nine p.m. saturday in eastern odisha state along the bay of bengal
debris littered wet streets roofs were torn off houses and windows on buildings were smashed in brahmapur
odisha's director general of police prakash mishra told cnn that two men and a woman were killed by trees brought down by heavy winds in the state
local police in odisha told cnn's sister network in india cnn ibn that seven people had been killed by falling trees
hurricanes are known as cyclones in the indian ocean and the wind speed at landfall one hundred and forty mph made it equivalent to a category four hurricane
india evacuated more than a half million people in advance of the storm hoping to avoid a repetition of what happened one thousand nine hundred and ninety nine when a cyclone claimed ten thousand lives
we have taken a zero casualty approach said odisha state disaster manager kamal lochan mishra
if people do not move force will be used to evacuate them
since friday phailin has brought nearly eight inches of rain to odisha's capital of bhubaneswar about thirty miles from the coast
the city's average rainfall for october is six point five inches
the storm will continue to fall apart as it moves over land but tropical storm force winds are still possible through early monday said cnn meteorologist judson jones
rainfall will also be a problem as phailin moves up toward the himalayas in nepal
multiple states in the region were under weather warnings for excessive rainfall and thunderstorms for most of sunday and into monday jones said
residents were evacuated to safer places in odisha and the neighboring state of andhra pradesh national disaster management authority chief marri shashidhar reddy said
more than four hundred thousand were moved to safety in odisha alone he told cnn
many of those evacuated from low lying coastal areas of odisha left on foot or by bicycle kamal lochan mishra said
they are being housed in nearly two hundred and fifty emergency shelters set up in sturdy buildings like schools and government offices
the ganjam district of odisha is expected to be the worst hit with disaster preparedness efforts concentrated there cnn ibn reported
the india meteorological department warned of extensive damage to kutcha houses those made of flimsy materials like mud and bamboo as well as damage to old buildings
power and communication lines are likely to suffer large scale disruption
extensive flooding will also disrupt rail and road traffic and crops are likely to suffer major damage it said
in gopalpur a coastal resort town in ganjam restaurants were shuttered and streets deserted saturday afternoon as rain lashed down
tourists and local residents were asked to leave the town
power was out in coastal areas including kalingapatnam from where about eighty thousand people were evacuated to relief camps cnn ibn reported
some fishermen earlier told the broadcaster they had defied the order to leave anxious to see what happened on the shore
some fear a repeat of what happened on october twenty nine one thousand nine hundred and ninety nine when cyclone five b also known as the odisha cyclone made landfall in the same area killing ten thousand people
it was the strongest tropical cyclone recorded in the bay of bengal with winds of one hundred and fifty five mph at landfall and it caused more than two billion dollar in damage
in advance of the storm military units and national disaster response force personnel were deployed to coastal areas with relief supplies and medical aid cnn ibn said
more than twenty medical teams flew to the region
federal and state government ministers are being briefed on the situation the cabinet secretary said
all flights to odisha have been canceled and train services in the state are also disrupted cnn's sister network reported
international humanitarian organization world vision said it was helping local community groups prepare for the cyclone's arrival
in a storm of this magnitude there is the potential for widespread damage to crops and livestock in the low lying coastal areas and houses completely wiped away said kunal shah the head of world vision's emergency response in india
so while we are praying this storm loses intensity we're also preparing
the organization has worked for the past several years to train local people in disaster preparedness including search and rescue basic first aid and how to protect livestock and has thousands of emergency response kits ready to hand out where needed
we believe communities are better prepared than they were when the devastating cyclone hit in one thousand nine hundred and ninety nine said shah

even as they trade barbs publicly and even as artillery shells and accusations continue to fly in syria the united states and russia could take solace friday in at least one respect
they are still talking
discussions between the two in geneva centered around moscow's proposal to have syrian president bashar al assad's government hand over its chemical weapons stockpile were supposed to end friday
they continued through the night and were extended into saturday for a reason u.s. officials said
if there was no opening we wouldn't still be here a senior state department official said
an obama administration official said separately that we are coming closer to agreement on the scope of syria's chemical weapons stockpile
and even before the geneva talks extension was announced u.s. secretary of state john kerry and russian foreign minister sergey lavrov signaled their intent to meet again
on september twenty four in new york on the sidelines of the u.n. general assembly
the prospect of yet another round of negotiations in the next few weeks pointed to a potentially bigger endgame for the united states and russia in the hastily arranged meeting they began on thursday in the swiss city
that's not to say all of the many outstanding issues on syria's chemical weapons and much more have been resolved
senior u.s. administration officials told reporters on condition of not being identified the main sticking point was what consequences al assad and his government should face
these officials have no expectations russia would agree to any u.n. resolution that included authorization for possible military force against syria
the united states therefore will not insist it be included
that runs counter to obama's call for the international community to take action including a potential military strike for what the united states and allies call a chemical weapons attack by al assad's forces last month outside syria's capital that they say killed more than one thousand four hundred people
obama has threatened to act alone if necessary and his administration credits that threat with russia's surprise proposal last week to have syria turn over its chemical weapons arsenal to international control
outside of the united nations however administration officials insisted they would not take the military threat off the table
a senior defense official said there has been no change in the military's planning or readiness levels and commanders have not been instructed to change their posture in any way
the united nations and especially its security council including permanent members the united states russia china france and britain could play a key role in the international community's response to syria
and a report by its inspectors looking into an august twenty one chemical weapons attack outside damascus could be pivotal in guiding where countries come down on the issue
u.n. secretary general ban ki mooon is expected to present the report to the security council at eleven a.m. monday three diplomatic sources said
ban said friday that he believes it will be an overwhelming report that chemical weapons were used
the big questions are by whom and if that's settled what the world should do about it
al assad and other syrian officials have vehemently denied their forces were responsible despite assertions by obama and others to the contrary
russia has stood by its longtime ally syria challenging the validity of the u.s. claims
at the same time and as the threat of u.s. led strikes loomed moscow raised its proposal on syria's chemical weapons stockpiles and working through the u.n. this after time and again blocking u.n. action involving syria
al assad quickly agreed leading to the talks between kerry and lavrov in geneva that began thursday
syria also told the united nations on thursday that it has sent the paperwork for joining the chemical weapons convention which bans such armaments
the syrian submission was being reviewed by u.n. lawyers
if deemed sufficient secretary general ban ki moon would register it and syria would officially be a member state in the convention
at first the geneva talks were about russia's proposal monday for syria to give up control of its chemical weapons which the united states had demanded in order for obama to drop plans to launch military strikes
now the stakes have gotten higher with kerry telling reporters that progress in the broader peace process will largely depend on whether the current geneva negotiations on syria's chemical weapons succeed
a communique from last year's syrian peace talks attended by all parties called for a ceasefire and establishing a fully inclusive transitional government to write a new constitution
that went nowhere however
in fact the u.n. estimates more than one hundred thousand people have been killed since the civil war began in two thousand and eleven in addition to more than two million becoming refugees and over four million being displaced within syria
lakhdar brahimi the joint u.n. arab league envoy on syria expressed fresh hopes friday that a peaceful political solution to end the war could be reached
kerry and lavrov's talks were a big reason for his optimism with brahimi calling them extremely important not regarding chemical weapons but for the peace process generally
to keep up pressure on al assad obama on friday described last month's chemical weapons attack a criminal act
ban weighed in as well saying the syrian leader has committed many crimes against humanity and therefore i am sure there will be surely a process of accountability when everything is over
u.s. officials say the mere existence of talks with russia on the matter is progress noting that such a prospect would not have been considered just a week ago due to moscow's repeated efforts to block u.n. action against syria
speaking to reporters friday after he and lavrov met with brahimi kerry called the talks about syria's chemical weapons constructive
we are working hard to find common ground to be able to make that happen
and we discussed some of the homework that we both need to do kerry said
lavrov said russia had promoted a peaceful solution to syria's civil war adding that the communique agreed to in last year's first round of peace talks involving all the parties had been basically abandoned
on chemical weapons lavrov said international officials had to work together to design a road which would make sure that this issue is resolved quickly professionally as soon as practical
opinion
is diplomacy the harder solution in syria 
even if all parties agree weapons experts say the already major challenge of putting syria's chemical stockpile under international control would be extremely difficult if not impossible amid an active civil war
syria this week acknowledged that it possesses chemical weapons and wants to join the global convention that bans them
cnn's nick paton walsh reports that the convention would become legally binding on syria thirty days after it formally joins meaning al assad's government would have to permit inspections at that time
after another thirty days which would be sixty days from when it formally joined the convention syria would have to declare its chemical weapons stockpiles
on thursday al assad noted that joining the convention would give syria the standard thirty days from compliance to declare its stockpiles but kerry responded by expressing concern about that long a time period saying we believe there is nothing standard about this process
at the state department on friday spokeswoman marie harf said that verifying accounting for securing and destroying a large stockpile of chemical weapons takes time adding that it's very difficult to do particularly in an active war zone
if we keep forward momentum if we believe there's a credible and verifiable plan on the table to do just that we'll keep moving forward with that process because resolving this issue diplomatically is certainly preferable to resolving it or to dealing with it with military action harf said
in turkey u.s. soldiers guard against syrian missile threat
obama had tried to put together a nato coalition to attack syria but the british parliament voted against taking part denying him a normally reliable ally
other allies said they wanted u.n. authorization in the form of a security council resolution before they would join a coalition
the president then asked congress to authorize a military response in syria but appeared in danger of losing that vote until the russian proposal monday provided a diplomatic opening
in a speech to the nation tuesday night obama made moral and strategic arguments for taking action on syria challenging congress and the american public to look at video footage of victims of the chemical attack
russian president vladimir putin responded with an op ed posted wednesday night on the new york times website saying there is every reason to believe syrian troops weren't responsible while challenging washington and the idea of american exceptionalism
his remarks provoked a strong reaction in the united states with some u.s. politicians deeming them insulting and sickening
but rather than step back putin spokesman dmitry peskov fired back by claiming washington was unaccustomed competition in global matters and has grown too used to patting everyone on the back patronizingly
one has to do with the syrian opposition some of whom are already receiving u.s. funded weapons and ammunition according to a u.s. official
yet there's some questions about the mix of moderates and islamist extremists among the rebels including some who are affiliated with al qaeda
then there's the issue of syria's chemical weapons themselves and whether it's possible to track all of them down
some u.s. intelligence analysts believe it's known where most of syria's stockpile is stored according to two u.s. officials familiar with internal discussions
but others say the united states might not be able to verify the location of up to fifty percents of them

three more people were arrested saturday in connection with last week's grisly killing of british soldier lee rigby police said
the men were being held on suspicion of conspiracy to commit murder the metropolitan police said in a statement
police did not detail how they were allegedly tied to the killing nor did they release their identities saying only that the men ages twenty one twenty four and twenty eight were arrested by detectives from the counter terrorism command and taken to a south london police station
police said a taser was used on two of the men who did not require hospital treatment
police also were carrying out search warrants at four residential addresses associated with the three men the statement said
the brutal slaying wednesday of rigby near the royal artillery barracks in woolwich a working class neighborhood in southeast london shocked people across the united kingdom
one of the two suspects arrested at the scene approached a man filming the scene in the woolwich neighborhood and suggested that rigby had been targeted only because muslims are dying daily at the hands of british troops such as him
we must fight them as they fight us
an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth he said in the video aired by cnn affiliate itn
britain's armed forces have served in iraq and afghanistan
all its combat troops are due to leave afghanistan by the end of two thousand and fourteen
another man twenty nine who was arrested thursday on suspicion of conspiracy to murder in connection with the woolwich investigation was released on bail police said saturday
british counterterrorism police arrested a man who said he was a friend of a suspect in the woolwich soldier killing after he gave an interview to the bbc on friday night the british broadcaster said
the man abu nusaybah was arrested on suspected terrorism offenses after telling on air how his friend had been approached by britain's domestic intelligence service known as mi five according to the broadcaster
a bbc staffer who did not want to be named told cnn that police were inside the bbc broadcasting house building in central london waiting for the interview to conclude before they made the arrest
friends acquaintances and british media identified twenty eight year old michael adebolajo a british national of nigerian descent as the suspect seen in a gory video from the scene of the woolwich killing
authorities have not identified that individual or the twenty two year old man seized with him at the scene by armed police
both suspects were shot and remain in hospital
a scotland yard spokesman told cnn the arrest at the bbc was not connected to the murder investigation in woolwich
the attack has sparked concerns that anti muslim sentiment may flare up in communities angered by the killing of the soldier drummer lee rigby
members of a far right group the english defence league called for muslims to leave britain as they rallied in newcastle northern england on saturday
the protest march came only hours after a group that monitors anti muslim abuse told cnn of a big spike in reported incidents in the past two days
in the interview with bbc's newsnight abu nusaybah said mi five had approached adebolajo in the past year asking if he wanted to work for them
adebolajo rejected the approach according to his friend
abu nusaybah said the contact from mi five occurred last year after adebolajo returned from a visit to kenya during which he was detained by security forces
adebolajo told his friend that he was physically assaulted and sexually threatened during his detention
cnn is working to independently verify the allegations made by abu nusaybah about his friend's treatment in detention
abu nusaybah went on to say that adebolajo appeared changed and withdrawn after his return from kenya
the pair first met in two thousand and two he said
abu nusaybah had converted to islam in late two thousand and four and adebolajo followed suit about four months later he said
a security source told cnn that we would never comment on the kind of allegations made in the interview
london's metropolitan police service said a thirty one year old man had been arrested in london on friday night on terrorism related offenses but following standard practice would not give the arrested man's name
officers from counter terrorism command arrested the man under the terrorism act on suspicion of the commission preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism
he was taken to a south london police station where he remains in custody a police statement said
search warrants were being executed at two homes in east london police said
kenyan counterterrorism sources told cnn on saturday that adebolajo traveled to kenya in november two thousand and ten and was arrested in the coastal town of lamu for trying to cross illegally into somalia
a spokesman for the kenyan government said sunday that adebolajo used the name michael olemindis ndemolajo when he was arrested and taken to a court in mombasa
kenyan officials turned him over to british authorities in kenya when they discovered he was a british citizen muthui kariuki said
he was interrogated by british security officials he said
lamu is part of an area near the somali border that has been the stage for attacks by armed gangs and suspected operatives from the al qaeda linked al shabaab militant group
no charges were filed against adebolajo according to the kenyan media
the british foreign office said
we can confirm a british national was arrested in kenya in two thousand and ten
we provided consular assistance as normal for british nationals
it's not clear whether adebolajo may have traveled to the region on more than one occasion
cnn understands that one line of inquiry being examined in the woolwich terror investigation is that adebolajo might have attempted but failed to travel to somalia some time last year
a self proclaimed former radical associate of abu nusaybah told cnn terrorism analyst paul cruickshank he had been a follower of the group al muhajiroun a british group of islamic extremists virulently opposed to uk intervention in iraq and openly supportive of al qaeda
the former associate who spoke to cnn on condition of not being named spent time with abu nusaybah in al muhajiroun study groups in luton a town north of london in the years leading up to the july seven two thousand and five attacks on london's transit system he said
at the time adebolajo himself was a follower of the group and attended meetings in london according to several al muhajiroun insiders before moving away from the group two or three years ago
abu nusaybah was very quiet always smiling and very religious said his former friend who has now shed his radical views
he said their circle of friends in luton included taimour abdulwahab al abdaly who carried out a suicide bombing in stockholm in december two thousand and ten in which he was the only fatality
he said abu nusaybah had connections to a group of somali extremists in luton
it is understood that the two individuals suspected in the knife and cleaver attack were known to britain's domestic security service
they had featured in previous investigations into other individuals but were not themselves under surveillance

north korea launched three short range guided missiles into the sea off the korean peninsula's east coast saturday south korea's semi official news agency yonhap cited the south korean defense ministry as saying
the ministry said it had detected two launches in the morning followed by another in the afternoon yonhap reported
the missiles were fired in a northeasterly direction away from south korean waters the ministry said
south korea has beefed up monitoring on north korea and is maintaining a high level of readiness to deal with any risky developments the ministry added according to yonhap
according to the arms control association a u.s. based organization short range guided missiles are generally classified as those traveling less than one thousand kilometers
tensions in the region have eased in recent days since a fraught period last month that included near daily north korean threats of war
u.s. and south korean officials feared at that time that kim jong un's regime was planning to carry out a test launch of longer range ballistic missiles believed to be musudans
the south korean government says they have a maximum range of three thousand five hundred kilometers
andrew salmon a journalist and author based in the south korean capital seoul said north korea's reported launch of short range missiles saturday should not cause the same degree of concern as the launch of a satellite or medium range musudan rocket
it's a short range tactical weapon
if any other country launched this kind of weapon it's a routine test nobody would be too worried
it's really simply because it's north korea doing this that it raises concerns he said
the situation is much less tense in the region than it was last month salmon said
the north koreans have significantly de escalated their bellicosity and their rhetoric since the end of april he said
the south korean government i suspect will not be strongly condemnatory of this test because right now they are very very keen to get the north koreans to the negotiating table
the recent tensions flared after the north's long range rocket launch in december and underground nuclear test in february both of which were widely condemned
pyongyang's fiery rhetoric intensified in march as the u.n. security council voted to tighten sanctions on the regime following the nuclear test
annual u.s. south korean military drills in south korea also fueled the north's anger especially when the united states carried out displays of strength that included nuclear capable b two stealth bombers
north korea is demanding recognition as a nuclear power something the united states refuses to countenance
last month's crisis resulted in the closure of the kaesong industrial complex the last major symbol of inter korean cooperation

the maker of a fake bomb detector that investigators say put lives at risk was sentenced thursday to ten years in prison by a london court
james mccormick fifty seven marketed his ade six hundred and fifty one units to government agencies and private companies around the world including in iraq with sales exceeding fifty million dollar by his own admission
however independent tests showed the device has no better than a random chance of finding a golf ball much less a bomb
british police say the device the ade standing for advanced detection equipment is really a novelty golf ball finder with the label removed
judge richard hone at the old bailey court said he was taking the rare step of passing the maximum possible sentence because of mccormick's cavalier disregard for the potentially fatal consequences of his fraudulent activity
mccormick was convicted last month on three counts of fraud
he was sentenced to ten years on each of the counts to run concurrently
half of the ten year term must be served before he's eligible for release on parole the judge said
while specific cases of death or injury as a result of the use of the devices can't be proved their sale was a callous confidence trick the judge said
the jury found that you knew the devices did not work yet the soldiers in iraq and elsewhere believed in them in part due to your powers of salesmanship and in part the extravagant and fraudulent claims made in your promotional material
after a six week trial i am wholly satisfied that your fraudulent conduct in selling so many useless devices for simply enormous profit promoted a false sense of security and in all probability materially contributed to causing death and injury to innocent individuals
explaining his decision to hand mccormick the maximum possible sentence the judge focused on the scale of the fraud and its potentially deadly consequences
mccormick was the driving force and sole director of his company atsc and with a small number of employees sold well over seven thousand devices to the iraqi government and other international agencies for between two thousand five hundred dollar and thirty thousand dollar per unit the judge said
one invoice showed total sales in excess of thirty eight million dollar to iraq over a period of nearly three years he added
police investigators believe it cost mccormick less than sixty dollar to make each device
in some places the fake detectors remain in use and are a continuing danger to life hone said
soldiers police forces border customs officers hotel security staff and many other users trusted their lives to the overpriced devices sold by you which were no more than plastic components with a disconnected antenna with a capability of detecting explosives no better than random chance he said
your profits were obscene funding grand houses a greedy and extravagant lifestyle and even a yacht
mccormick also has shown no remorse for his actions the judge said
he made millions from the sale of the devices and used the proceeds to fund a luxurious lifestyle
ahead of the sentencing a defense lawyer for mccormick told the court that there was no evidence that vehicles carrying bombs passed through checkpoints where his devices were in use
mccormick was not responsible for any attacks his lawyer said and any number of devices could not protect the people of iraq
superintendent nigel rock of avon and somerset police told reporters outside the court that the next step for investigators would be to ensure that all the proceeds from mccormick's criminal activities are seized
rock described him as a shameless con man who had personally pocketed millions of dollars from his scam
but it wasn't just a good sales line that allowed mccormick over a ten year period to become wealthy from a fraudulent device
an iraqi general has been jailed for procuring the ade six hundred and fifty one through unauthorized channels
british police believe that mccormick paid off officials to buy the ade six hundred and fifty one in bulk

britain's first female prime minister margaret thatcher has been honored in a ceremonial funeral service at st. paul's cathedral in london
the bells of the landmark domed cathedral rang half muffled as pallbearers carried thatcher's coffin to a hearse ahead of a private cremation and burial
queen elizabeth ii and her husband prince philip were among the more than two thousand mourners who attended the service
at least one hundred and seventy countries were represented among them
mourners included canadian prime minister stephen harper former u.s. house speaker newt gingrich and f.w
de klerk the last apartheid era president of south africa
former u.s. vice president dick cheney and former u.s. secretary of state henry kissinger attended but nancy reagan the widow of thatcher's ally and former u.s. president ronald reagan was unable to attend and sent a representative in her place
thatcher died of a stroke on april eight aged eighty seven
she was accorded a ceremonial style funeral with full military honors similar to those of diana princess of wales and the queen mother
the funeral was organized in line with the wishes of thatcher herself and those of her twin children mark and carol
serving uk prime minister david cameron and thatcher's granddaughter amanda both gave readings while the bishop of london the right rev
richard chartres gave the address
the bishop noted that the service was a funeral rather than memorial
at such a time the parson should not aspire to the judgments which are proper to the politician
instead this is a place for ordinary human compassion of the kind that is reconciling he said
chartres paid tribute to thatcher's courtesy and personal kindness which she showed to those who worked for her as well as her capacity to reach out to the young and often also to those who were not in the world's eyes important 
perseverance in struggle and the courage to be were characteristic of margaret thatcher the bishop said
in a setting like this in the presence of the leaders of the nation it is easy to forget the immense hurdles she had to climb
as a mark of respect the chimes of big ben as the bell and clock tower by the palace of westminster are commonly known were silenced for the duration of the proceedings
the flag at ten downing street flew at half staff
rewriting history
how uk might have been without thatcher
a horse drawn carriage earlier carried thatcher's coffin through the heart of the british capital to st. paul's on a procession route lined with british army royal navy and royal air force personnel
thatcher's coffin had lain overnight at a chapel at the palace of westminster and was taken by hearse to the church of st. clement danes the royal air force chapel on the strand before being transferred to the gun carriage
as it traveled through the streets both cheers and boos were heard from bystanders reflecting the divisive legacy of the politician known as the iron lady
the threat of demonstrations on top of fears that dissident irish republicans may try to act heightened security concerns around the funeral and more than four thousand metropolitan police officers were placed on duty for the event
roads near st. paul's cathedral closed and buses were diverted from early wednesday as part of the security operation
many britons blame thatcher for creating soaring unemployment but supporters believe the tough reforms she pushed through transformed the british economy
thatcher
revered and reviled in death as in life
by eight thirty am local time supporters had crowded by the railings of the cathedral some with folding chairs and police stood on every few yards down the road to the cathedral
at ludgate circus a crowd of about fifty protesters waved socialist worker placards a sign reading anarchists against thatcher and rainbow hued peace flags
another held a sign demanding where was her respect for goldthorpe and the miners 
referring to thatcher's campaign against the power of coal mining unions
protester hilary jones said thatcher had been strident in her beliefs and her beliefs were so at odds to a large chunk of the population
there was nothing for many of us to feel proud of during her time she said
but conservative party activist lionel voke said he credited thatcher with the success of his business
we're here out of respect to us she was wonderful
i accept that not everyone sees it the same way but it's the same if tony blair died i wouldn't necessarily come but i'd expect him to be treated with respect and i'd want him to rest in peace
ian twinn said he had traveled from new york to mark the life changing impact thatcher had on him
i was a boy in the one thousand nine hundred and eighty s. rightly or wrongly she changed the landscape of the uk forever and she made me feel i could do anything he said
thatcher who led the conservative party from one thousand nine hundred and seventy five until she was forced to resign in one thousand nine hundred and ninety remained involved in british politics for the next decade or so
she was named baroness thatcher of kesteven after leaving office and served in the house of lords
she retired from public life after a stroke in two thousand and two and suffered several smaller strokes after that

the security plans for the london marathon this weekend are being reassessed after the deadly bomb blasts in boston london's metropolitan police said tuesday
police and race organizers said they are working closely on security for sunday's race
about thirty five thousand runners take part in the london marathon each year and many more people turn out to cheer them on
we will be reviewing our security arrangements in partnership with london marathon said event commander chief supt
julia pendry
the metropolitan police have a wealth of experience in policing a wide range of public order events across london she said
the london marathon organizers said tuesday the event will go ahead as originally scheduled
we have reviewed and will continue to review our security arrangements with the metropolitan police and other authorities a statement on the event website said tuesday
chief executive nick bitel said
we want to reassure our runners spectators volunteers and everyone connected with the event that we are doing everything to ensure their safety
the organizers said monday they were deeply saddened and shocked by the news from boston
our immediate thoughts are with all the people there and their families
it is a very sad day for athletics and for our friends and colleagues in marathon running they said in a statement
london is the next after boston of the six races that make up the world marathon majors series
the course which starts in southeast london passes through some of the capital's main business districts before finishing near buckingham palace
more than three quarters of those taking part will raise money for charity
the bombings in boston are shocking cowardly and horrific and the thoughts of all londoners this morning will be with the victims london mayor boris johnson said in a statement tuesday
boston is a proud city built on history tradition and a real sense of community
these attacks were aimed at its core at innocent men women and children enjoying a spring day out at a major sporting event
we do have robust security measures in place for sunday's london marathon but given events in boston it's only prudent for the police and the organizers of sunday's race to reexamine those security arrangements
cnn anchor piers morgan tweeted
london marathon this sunday security at these events will never be the same again
will geddes managing director of threat management company international corporate protection told cnn that it is very difficult to secure a marathon
you can look at isolating particular areas and trying to secure these however you are looking at a twenty six mile plus route which often will spread across a major capital and in terms of protecting it right along the route it will be very very difficult he said
any potential terrorist will be looking for the largest number of casualties they can achieve so the start point and the finish point will no doubt be two areas the metropolitan police will be focusing on and how they can secure those
but geddes said to a certain degree there is only so much they can do
one key element will be the awareness of the general public which in recent years has played an increasing role in alerting authorities to any suspicious activities or bags left unattended he added
a big security operation will also swing into place on wednesday for the funeral of margaret thatcher britain's first woman prime minister
the metropolitan police have said parts of the transport network will be closed down and there will be a large military and police presence on the streets as the funeral procession passes through central london
last summer authorities successfully implemented a huge security plan to keep the city safe during the london olympics

about seventy thousand refugees who fled violence in mali are living in appalling conditions in a camp in the middle of the mauritanian desert doctors without borders said friday
the situation has only got worse in mbera camp since french forces entered mali in january to help local forces take on islamist militants the humanitarian group said
about fifteen thousand more refugees have flooded into the camp since the fighting and conditions are so bad there that many who were healthy became ill or malnourished after they arrived
the number of children admitted to clinics in the camp for severe malnutrition more than doubled in that time climbing from forty two to one hundred and six doctors without borders said
about eighty five percents of the children under treatment arrived between january and february despite the nutritional status of the new refugees being generally good when assessed on arrival
these statistics show that the refugees have grown weaker whilst in the camp the very place where they should have been receiving assistance including correctly formulated food rations from aid organizations said henry gray emergency coordinator for doctors without borders
there has clearly been a lack of preparation for this new influx of refugees
the camp was set up by the u.n. refugee agency unhcr with the mauritanian government sixty kilometers from the border when refugees started arriving in early two thousand and twelve
the report stranded in the desert is based on testimonies collected from more than one hundred refugees at the mbera camp between february and mid march of this year
the majority of the refugees in mbera camp are pastoralists who lived nomadic or semi nomadic lifestyles in northern mali according to the report
some of the families left their young men behind to tend to their herds while they fled over the border into neighboring mauritania
most of the refugees are from the tuareg and arab communities said gray
they fled preemptively often for fear of violence due to their presumed links with islamist or separatist groups
their home in northern mali is still in the grip of fear and mistrust
while some improvements have been made at the camp since the mass influx of new refugees three months ago doctors without borders said the challenge will be to continue to provide assistance that meets humanitarian standards
water is still in short supply in the desert camp a situation made worse by daytime temperatures that reach fifty degrees celsius
refugees at mbera receive just eleven liters of water per person per day instead of the twenty liters recommended by humanitarian standards the report said
some of the families that arrived in january had to wait more than a month for materials to build shelters the report said
they were forced to do what they could with sticks and scraps of cloth in the meantime
there is also a serious shortage of toilet facilities
when the camp was extended in january to accommodate the influx of refugees there were four latrines for twelve thousand people far below the recommended minimum of one per twenty people
more are now being built but the hygiene situation remains difficult
another problem is that the rations provided by the u.n. world food program mostly rice and pulses are very different from the pastoralist refugees customary diet which is based on meat and milk
many new arrivals also suffer from delays in getting food supplies the report said
and with the situation in northern mali still volatile as french and african forces hunt down the remaining islamist fighters and against a backdrop of complex ethnic and political tensions it's unclear when the refugees will feel able to return home
a seventy one year old malian interviewed for the report ibrahimou said three sons had stayed in their village to care for the livestock but the rest of his family had left
with the other village chiefs we took the decision to leave out of fear of the malian army he said
i lost brothers and cousins in one thousand nine hundred and ninety two
i saw a lot of atrocities and i lost a lot of loved ones in the conflict
i almost lost all my animals too
this time we left early
nobody knows when we will be back but at my age i have no desire to go into exile every ten years
about a quarter of those interviewed said they'd fled direct fighting where their lives or family members lives were in danger
a small percentage said they had fled because of the seizure of power by islamist groups in cities such as timbuktu gao and kidal
islamist extremists carved out a large haven in northern mali last year taking advantage of a chaotic situation after a military coup by the separatist party mnla
many of the most recent arrivals in the camp told doctors without borders they had left mali because of food shortages and other problems
life has become very hard
i had nothing to give to my children
there was nothing to eat shops were closed or empty
there was no market for cattle
i could not stay because i have small children to feed said halima aged twenty four
doctors without borders has been working at mbera camp since february two thousand and twelve when the first groups of refugees from mali began to arrive
its teams have treated about one thousand malnourished children since then and delivered about two hundred babies
even before the latest influx of refugees the nutritional situation was critical with a study by doctors without borders in november revealing mortality rates above the emergency threshold for children under two years old
since the french led intervention in january the number of consultations at its clinics in the camp has gone up from one thousand five hundred to two thousand five hundred per week doctors without borders said
unhcr has said that it and partner agencies struggle to maintain minimum humanitarian standards in mbera camp

the husband of an indian dentist whose death sparked anger over ireland's abortion laws told an inquest on monday that her requests for a termination for her miscarrying fetus had been denied
praveen halappanavar told the hearing in galway that he was told that because ireland is a catholic country an abortion could not be done while the fetus was still alive
he was one of the first witnesses to give evidence at the inquest which is expected to last several days
the death of savita halappanavar at university hospital galway on october twenty eight prompted anger in ireland and elsewhere and sparked demands for ireland to introduce new abortion laws
doctors and nurses from the galway hospital are also due to testify at the inquest
praveen halappanavar said as he arrived at the courthouse that he hoped the inquest would get to the truth
he has previously said that his wife was advised her unborn baby would likely die and that she was in extreme pain
savita thirty one went into the hospital on october twenty one complaining of back pain
she was seventeen weeks pregnant at the time
three days after the request for a termination was made the fetus died and was removed
four days later savita died of a blood infection
the coroner dr. ciaran mcloughlin opened the hearing with a promise to halappanavar to help find out what happened to his wife
an inquest by a coroner is standard procedure in cases of sudden unexplained or unnatural deaths in ireland
the couple who married in india had moved to ireland four years before savita's death and were excited to be starting a family praveen halappanavar told cnn last year
he said the family was left stunned and grief stricken by her death
every single person in the family asked me how could this happen in a place like ireland in the twenty one st century 
because it was just so simple he said
when they knew the baby was not going to survive why not think about the bigger life which was the mother my wife savita 
and they didn't
a number of inquiries were set up by irish authorities after halappanavar died including one by the health service executive
the health service executive report has not yet been published but details of the draft text have been leaked to the irish media
the irish government plans to introduce new abortion legislation by the summer
minister of health james reilly announced late last year that the proposed changes would clarify that abortions are permissible when the life but not just the health of the mother is at risk
that would bring the country's laws in line with a one thousand nine hundred and ninety two irish supreme court ruling that established a woman's right to abortion when her life is at risk including by suicide

the french senate opened debate thursday on a controversial bill that would extend the right to marry and adopt to same sex couples
the lower house has already approved the legislation
if it passes the senate it would mark the biggest step forward for french gay rights advocates in more than a decade
but the plan faces stiff opposition from the roman catholic church other religious groups and social conservatives with huge numbers turning out for protest marches in paris in recent weeks
at the same time the legislation has won wide backing from gay rights advocates
the senate debate is expected to continue into next week
same sex marriage
who will legalize it next 
france is not the only nation currently wrestling with the polarizing issue
uruguayan senators voted overwhelmingly in favor of a same sex marriage measure tuesday despite vocal opposition from the catholic church
next week lawmakers in the lower house are expected to vote on the senate's version
legislators in the united kingdom are also weighing proposals to legalize same sex marriage
in the united states the issue went before the supreme court last week and justices are now deliberating over the matter
nine states and the district of columbia issue marriage licenses to same sex couples including three states maryland washington and maine where voters approved it in ballot initiatives last year
the other forty one states have specific laws blocking gays and lesbians from legally marrying
the first same sex couples walked down the aisle in the netherlands in two thousand and one
since then almost a dozen countries have passed laws allowing same sex marriages and domestic partnerships including canada south africa belgium and spain
in argentina the push to legalize same sex marriage met with fierce opposition from the roman catholic church with cardinal jorge mario bergoglio then the archbishop of buenos aires and now the pope engaging in a notorious war of words with the government over the issue
it was approved in two thousand and ten
the issue also has divided australia where lawmakers voted against a bill to legalize same sex marriage last september
a poll for the advocacy group australian marriage equality indicated that sixty four percents of those surveyed support marriage equality
extending the right to marry and adopt to same sex couples in france was one of president francois hollande's electoral pledges in campaigning last year
the left which includes hollande's governing socialist party dominates the national assembly where the bill passed by a large majority in february
the party has only a slim majority in the senate
the issue has sparked strong reactions among ordinary voters as well as their legislators
some three hundred thousand people turned out for a protest march staged less than two weeks ago police in paris told cnn affiliate bfm tv
same sex marriage campaigner marc barronet told cnn it was not surprising that the move has provoked strong reactions from some
france is a rather progressive country
but you shouldn't forget that france also has some parts of rather conservative society and in times of economic crisis people tend to cling to what they know and fear change forgetting sometimes that change can bring improvements
opinion
gay rights in france how even the u.s. leads the way
nonetheless he is confident that the measure will pass sooner rather than later
france is a secular society so it's very different from other countries where religion plays a large part in the question of marriage he said
there is a clear majority in parliament in favor of this bill so it will become law
engineer driss houat sixty nine told cnn thursday he opposes the measure
i am completely against it because god created man and woman so that they could be married
not for anything else
it's absurd for me to see this bill pass he said
i am muslim so i believe in god
i think it's not a problem for me to accept
i don't understand people who think that god exists and can say i'm against the happiness of people she said
alexis nys a fifty eight year old salesman said he supports same sex marriage because at the end it's love that matters
not old things and old fashions
i think we need to live like we should live today
a law legalizing civil unions was introduced in one thousand nine hundred and ninety nine in france under a previous socialist government
known in france as the pacs the civil union agreement can be entered into by same sex or straight couples and confers many but not all of the rights of marriage

south african track star oscar pistorius charged with murder in the shooting death of girlfriend reeva steenkamp is once more allowed to travel overseas after a judge lifted a bail condition thursday restricting his movements
judge bert bam said that pistorius passport could be held by his attorney barry roux instead of the court and that he was entitled to use it to travel outside south africa
bam said he saw no reason why pistorius should be forbidden to leave south africa if invited to compete overseas
pistorius should report his itinerary a week before leaving and hand his travel documents back over to his lawyer within twenty four hours of returning to south africa bam said at pretoria's north gauteng high court
the athlete may also now drink alcohol and return home to the scene of the crime he ruled
bam said the magistrate who imposed the original bail restrictions last month had not included the prohibition on pistorius returning to his home or a requirement that he report to a police station twice a week in the written court order he signed
this means those provisions which the magistrate only mentioned verbally in court should be ignored bam said
the new order represents a victory for the athlete's legal team which went to court to request more lenient terms for his bail
not everyone surprised about pistorius fall from grace
the lifting of the travel ban could mean that the olympic and paralympic sprinter would return to international competition ahead of his trial
if pistorius qualifies for the moscow world championships in august then on the basis of the innocent until proven guilty principle he would be free to run yannis nikolaou communications manager for the international association of athletics federations told cnn via e mail
invitations are at the discretion of meeting organizers not the iaaf he said
the iaaf will not comment on the case against pistorius he added
the athlete's lawyers argued in their appeal filing that since pistorius was not considered a flight risk the restrictions on his travel were unnecessary
they also argued that since alcohol and substance abuse were not factors in the case the ban on their use was not warranted
pistorius had no desire to use alcohol or illegal drugs they added
authorities charged pistorius with premeditated murder after he shot steenkamp in the bathroom of his pretoria home on february fourteen
pistorius who spent eight days in jail before being freed on bail on february twenty two did not attend thursday's hearing
state prosecutor gerrie nel told the court thursday that he plans to serve pistorius with an indictment on june four
no trial date has yet been set
pistorius known as the blade runner for competing on carbon fiber blades fitted to the stumps of his amputated legs says he thought steenkamp was an intruder
prosecutors argue that he intentionally killed her after a loud argument

roaches crawling out of air vents
roaches climbing up seats and windows
roaches on people's coats and hats
roaches everywhere
it sounds like a scene from a horror movie but is in fact what passengers say happened on a greyhound bus journey from atlantic city to new york on friday
there's like a thousand roaches passenger dawn alexander told cnn affiliate wabc
and when i say infested i mean infested
people were in the aisles literally brushing roaches off of them
we thought it was one
it turned out to be a whole house full of roaches said a fellow passenger
i sat down roaches started crawling up on our clothes falling down from the ceiling
everything said another
cellphone footage shows the pests scurrying across the bus floor and steps
greyhound's media relations director maureen richmond said the bus driver had acted swiftly when passengers alerted him to bugs on the bus
he immediately pulled the bus over and radioed our dispatch office for assistance she told cnn
a second bus was immediately sent to continue the trip into new york
we have spoken with each passenger and provided full refunds
greyhound has apologized for the inconvenience to the forty eight passengers on board the bus which departed atlantic city around ten a.m. friday
we are investigating how they got there in bags or from the bus said richmond
what caused the insects to start pouring out of the air vents about fifteen minutes into the journey is not yet clear nor what greyhound plans to do to get rid of them
alexander told wabc she was sitting in the back of the bus when she saw those toward the front starting to panic
then after a while the panic got towards the back because we all started looking around and saw roaches crawling everywhere she said
according to the national institute of environmental health sciences roaches are common even in the cleanest of crowded urban areas and older dwellings and are found in all types of neighborhoods
happily the pests don't usually hitch a ride on a bus to the big apple

vatican city call him pope francis the pontiff of firsts
when jorge bergoglio stepped onto the balcony at the vatican on wednesday to reveal himself as the new leader of the world's one point two billion catholics he made history as the first non european pope of the modern era the first from latin america the first jesuit and the first to assume the name francis
what do you think about the new pope 
tell us
the new pope then quickly made another kind of history breaking with tradition in his first public act before the one hundred and fifty thousand people packed into st. peter's square
rather than bless the crowd first he asked them to pray for him
let us say this prayer your prayer for me in silence he told the cheering crowd
the willingness by francis to dispense with tradition was interpreted by a vatican spokesman as a sign he will be willing to chart his own path in other ways
we have a pope who probably upset some people tonight by not following the formula the rev
tom rosica said
the pontiff also broke with another tradition by refusing to use a platform to elevate himself above the cardinals standing with him as he was introduced to the world as pope francis
he said i'll stay down here cardinal timothy dolan archbishop of new york and the president of the u.s. conference of catholic bishops
he met each of us on our own level
francis wearing white papal robes appeared on a rain soaked night to the throngs shortly after being elected by cardinals in what apparently was the fifth round of voting on the second day of the conclave
as you know the duty of the conclave was to appoint a new bishop of rome he said
it seems to me that my brother cardinals have chosen one who is from faraway
but here i am
i would like to thank you for your embrace
as pope bergoglio takes the helm of a catholic church that has been rocked in recent years by sex abuse by priests and claims of corruption and infighting among the church hierarchy
the seventy six year old bergoglio who served as the archbishop of buenos aires is the first pope to take the name in honor of st. francis of assisi revered among catholics for his work with the poor
st. francis is viewed as a reformer of the church answering god's call to repair my church in ruins
the pontiff is considered a straight shooter who calls things as he sees them and a follower of the church's most social conservative wing
as a cardinal he clashed with the government of argentine president cristina fernandez de kirchner over his opposition to gay marriage and free distribution of contraceptives
latin america is home to four hundred and eighty million catholics
by choosing bergoglio the cardinals sent a strong message about where the future of the church may lie
according to a profile by cnn vatican analyst john allen and published by the national catholic reporter francis was born in buenos aires to an italian immigrant father
five things to know about the new pope
he is known for his simplicity
he chose to live in an apartment rather that the archbishop's palace passed on a chauffeured limousine took the bus to work and cooked his own meals allen wrote
francis has a reputation for being a voice for the poor
word of the election of pope francis who was not considered a front runner among analysts quickly spread around the globe with everyone from u.n. secretary general ban ki moon to u.s. president barack obama offering congratulations
as the first pope from the americas his selection also speaks to the strength and vitality of a region that is increasingly shaping our world and alongside millions of hispanic americans those of us in the united states share the joy of this historic day obama said
ban said the new pope shares common goals with the united nations from the promotion of peace to social justice
we also share the conviction that we can only resolve the interconnected challenges of today's world through dialogue he said
nowhere was the reaction to bergoglio's selection as pope more surprising than in latin america
i am truly still very surprised
not just that a latino pope came out but that he is an argentinian from buenos aires the rev
eduardo mangiarotti told cnn en espanol
the new pope called his predecessor benedict xvi after he was elected rosica said
francis plans to visit with benedict on thursday ahead of an evening mass with the cardinals in the sistine chapel according to the vatican
francis participated in the conclave that elected benedict in april two thousand and five
he was widely reported to be a runner up to benedict in the election
the new pontiff will deliver the traditional angelus blessing from the vatican on sunday rosica said
francis will be formally installed as pope at a mass on tuesday according to the vatican
bergoglio's selection of the name of pope francis is the most stunning choice and precedent shattering allen said
the new pope is sending a signal that this will not be business as usual
the name symbolizes poverty humility simplicity and rebuilding the catholic church allen said
st. francis of assisi was born in one thousand one hundred and eighty one or one thousand one hundred and eighty two the son of a rich italian cloth merchant according to the vatican website
after a carefree adolescence and youth francis joined the military and was taken prisoner
he was freed after becoming ill and when he returned to assisi italy a spiritual conversion began and he abandoned his worldly lifestyle
in a famous episode christ on the cross came to life three times in the small church of st. damian and told him
go francis and repair my church in ruins pope benedict xvi said according to vatican's website

swaths of northern europe were in the grip of snow ice and high winds tuesday causing serious disruption to road rail and air travelers
high speed train operator eurostar which runs services linking paris brussels and london among other destinations has canceled the rest of its services tuesday and told passengers to stay at home
severe weather conditions overnight in northern france and belgium have led to the closure of the high speed line a notice on the company's website said
passengers will not be able to travel on eurostar services today and should not come to our stations
about ten thousand passengers are likely to be affected as a result of the cancellation of around twenty four out of twenty seven scheduled trains tuesday eurostar spokeswoman lucy drake said
the bad weather may also affect services wednesday she said with further cancellations or extended journey times possible
passengers affected by the disruption will be offered exchanges or refunds drake said and are urged to consider traveling next week if possible
air travel has also been hit with germany's frankfurt airport a major european hub canceling all flights for several hours as it worked to clear its runways
some seven hundred out of a total one thousand two hundred and thirty eight flights have been canceled so far affecting roughly seven thousand passengers airport spokesman christopher holschier told cnn
two of frankfurt's four runways reopened for takeoff and landing as of five p.m. local time holschier said but snow continues to fall
holschier said passengers were resigned to the situation as they were well aware of the adverse conditions
already getting to the airport has been an ordeal he said
meanwhile the official twitter feed for the two main airports in paris warned that travel disruptions in the french capital were making access to the airports difficult
however train and bus services were starting to get back to normal in the afternoon it said
a quarter of flights from paris charles de gaulle and one in five flights from paris orly were canceled tuesday in anticipation of the heavy snowfall the two airports said monday
travelers were advised to check on their flight's status before heading to the airport
london heathrow and amsterdam schiphol airports have also reported snow in the past twenty four hours
late winter blasts like these are nothing new for central europe according to cnn meteorologist brandon miller
in fact in germany they have something known as mrzwinter or march winter said miller
the phenomenon occurs in mid march when after a period of spring like warmth early in the month that often sees trees and flowers begin to bloom cold northerly winds bring mid winter type weather back to the country
true to form last week there were seven consecutive days of above average temperatures in frankfurt
the mercury peaked saturday with a high of seventeen degrees celsius the kind of temperature usually expected in mid may
on tuesday however winter returned with a vengeance dropping twelve centimeters of snow by noon
in addition to the snow winds have gusted to fifty and sixty kilometers per hour creating whiteout conditions and making travel even more difficult
northern france has taken the brunt of the storm with some locations seeing up to forty centimeters of snow
gusty winds have created snow drifts a meter deep or more
meteo france has issued a red warning its highest level for snow and ice through wednesday morning
the wintry blast also caused problems for motorists in southeast england with some trapped in their vehicles overnight by accidents and road closures on icy highways in kent and sussex
conditions should improve by wednesday as the frontal system pushes south and loses some of its intensity but the cold temperatures will remain through the end of the week

people living in the falkland islands are voting in a referendum on their political status on sunday and monday at a time of heightened tensions between argentina and britain over their sovereignty
the two countries went to war over the territory known to the argentinians as las malvinas in one thousand nine hundred and eighty two after the then military government in argentina landed troops on the islands
according to the falklands legislative assembly the vote is intended to affirm islanders desire to remain a self governing territory of the united kingdom and to reject claims of ownership by argentina
the question put to voters is
do you wish the falkland islands to retain their current political status as an overseas territory of the united kingdom 
the two day referendum is supported by the british government
but the argentinian embassy in london said in a statement friday that the referendum had no legitimacy characterizing it as a further attempt by the british to manipulate the question of the malvinas islands
because the area around the falklands is the subject of a sovereignty dispute it argues the united kingdom has no right to alter the legal status of these territories not even under the guise of a hypothetical referendum 
in january argentinian president cristina fernandez de kirchner wrote an open letter published in the uk press in which she called on britain to hand back the islands and accused it of blatant colonialism
the argentines on the islands were expelled by the royal navy and the united kingdom subsequently began a population implantation process similar to that applied to other territories under colonial rule she wrote
since then britain the colonial power has refused to return the territories to the argentine republic thus preventing it from restoring its territorial integrity
she cited a one thousand nine hundred and sixty five u.n. resolution inviting the two countries to negotiate a solution to the sovereignty dispute and has called on the british to abide by the resolution
the british government rejected fernandez's call for negotiations saying the falkland island residents have chosen to be british and have a right to self determination as enshrined in the u.n. charter
the january statement added
there are three parties to this debate not just two as argentina likes to pretend
the islanders can't just be written out of history
as such there can be no negotiations on the sovereignty of the falklands islands unless and until such time as the islanders so wish
the british government accuses buenos aires of trying to coerce the falkland island residents into becoming part of argentina through intimidation of those involved in fishing and oil exploration and efforts to isolate the remote islands even further by limiting access by sea
located in the south atlantic ocean about four hundred and eighty kilometers east of the tip of south america the falklands have long been coveted as a strategic shipping stopover and potential wellspring of natural resources including lucrative fisheries and a growing oil drilling industry
the islands which raise their own taxes but rely on the united kingdom for defense and foreign policy are one of fourteen british overseas territories and have been under british rule since one thousand eight hundred and thirty three
more than two thousand five hundred people from more than sixty nations live and work there according to the islands government website as well as forces stationed at the british military's mount pleasant complex
many falkland island residents are of british origin
war broke out over the territory in one thousand nine hundred and eighty two when the then argentinian military government landed troops on the islands
argentina put its death toll from the conflict at around six hundred and forty five
britain's civil and military losses amounted to two hundred and fifty five
on its official website the falklands government rejects as false the argentinian government claim that a civilian population was expelled by britain in one thousand eight hundred and thirty three and argues for the inhabitants right to choose their path
the people expelled were an illegal argentine military garrison who had arrived three months earlier it says
the civilian population in the islands who had sought permission from britain to live there were invited to stay
all but two of them with their partners did so
we are not an implanted population
our community has been formed through voluntary immigration and settlement over the course of nearly two hundred years

we are no more an implanted population than are the various populations of south america whose ancestors arrived as immigrants from europe we arrived here as part of the same process and pattern of migration
the islands are economically self sufficient the government says except for the cost of defense needed as a result of the claim made by an aggressive neighbour
the falkland islanders are a peaceful hard working and resilient people
our society is thriving and forward looking
all we ask is to be left in peace to choose our own future and responsibly develop our home for our children and generations to come the government says

two people were killed and at least fifteen injured saturday in cairo officials said as egyptians in two rival cities took to the streets to vent their anger over court verdicts in a controversial case involving deadly riots at a soccer game
health ministry spokesman ahmed osman said two protesters had been killed in violence outside the semiramis intercontinental hotel in downtown cairo
five others have been injured in the clashes by the hotel he said
another ten are suffering smoke inhalation after a fire gutted the three story building housing the egyptian football association in a wealthy cairo neighborhood as soccer fans looked on
next door an exclusive club for policemen was also ablaze
in port said the other city with a stake in the court case small fires burned in the harbor
the military has been deployed in the volatile northeastern city to try to avoid a repeat of past violent protests
saturday's disorder erupted after a cairo court confirmed death sentences previously handed down to twenty one defendants in the port said soccer riot case and sentenced more than twenty others to prison terms state media said
the rampage in february two thousand and twelve left seventy four people dead and one thousand injured after the port said home team al masry soccer club defeated visiting cairo team al ahly
a majority of the victims in the stadium rampage where fans went at each other with rocks chairs knives and swords were cairo fans
of those sentenced to prison five people received life sentences and ten others were given fifteen years in prison the state run egynews agency reported
among those given a fifteen year term were the leading policeman on trial general essam samak former chief of security in port said and a second police official mohamed saad state media said
seven other policemen were acquitted
other prison sentences were lesser and the court cleared twenty eight people in total in the case egynews said
lawyers for the seventy three defendants who also included al masry club staff can file an appeal
there was some initial confusion in egyptian media over the final verdicts
the sentences have prompted anger in both cities with some protesters in port said believing they are too harsh and others in cairo convinced they do not go far enough
a statement on the ahly club's official website backed the cairo court but said the fight for justice wasn't over
the court's verdict was fair for fans of the ahly team
we support the prosecutor general's decision to appeal the twenty eight acquittals and we'll continue supporting the families of the port said football victims it said
we will not give up until justice is served to all their sons
but the lighter punishment for policemen accused of standing by amid the stadium violence angered some
eyewitnesses at the egyptian football association headquarters told cnn that ultra ahly fans outraged by the verdicts set the building ablaze as they marched towards tahrir square the usual focal point for demonstrations in the capital
the ultras are hardcore soccer fans who have also become involved in political protests
earlier around one thousand ahly supporters who were at the cairo soccer club erupted in cheers and set off fireworks to celebrate as the judges sitting in the police academy in new cairo a suburb of the capital gave their ruling
in port said near the sinai peninsula black smoke rose into the sky as tires fixed to docks went up in flames
the tires serve as rubber bumpers to prevent damage to ships knocking against the piers
without them anchoring in port is more difficult
port said demonstrators also protested against the nation's government and president mohamed morsy
some complained that justice for port said was sacrificed to placate cairo
their anger reflects a deeper resentment of the capital common in the port city
many port said residents believe that too much of the tax money collected from ships passing through the port lands in cairo which does not return enough of the funds to their municipal coffers
port said has been shaken by violent protests in recent days as the date for the verdict neared
deadly clashes erupted after the twenty one death sentences were first handed down in january
many residents of port said felt egyptian security forces didn't adequately defend the city during the series of wars with israel that began with the jewish state's creation in one thousand nine hundred and forty eight and ended after the one thousand nine hundred and seventy three arab israeli war

the catholic cardinals gathered in rome voted friday to begin the secret election or conclave to elect a new pope next tuesday afternoon the vatican said
the one hundred and fifteen cardinal electors taking part in the conclave will enter the closed door process after a morning mass the vatican said
only cardinals younger than eighty are eligible to vote
the cardinals voted friday morning to accept the letters of explanation of two cardinal electors who are eligible to vote for the next pope but will not attend the conclave
keith o'brien of scotland and julius riyadi darmaatmadja of indonesia
o'brien resigned in scandal last week after allegations that he made sexual advances toward young men studying to be priests
he apologized in a statement sunday saying there have been times that my sexual conduct has fallen below the standards expected of me as a priest archbishop and cardinal
since monday the cardinals have been uniting for what are known as general congregations a series of meetings in which they discuss the issues facing the church
these include how to tackle the issue of child sex abuse by priests and a scandal over leaks from the vatican last year that revealed claims of corruption within the roman catholic church hierarchy
opinion
how to pick a new pope
some cardinals took to the internet to make comments before friday afternoon's meeting that set the conclave date
cardinal peter turkson of ghana viewed as one of about a dozen leading candidates to become pope used twitter to ask for prayers
your continued prayers help us discern god's will
to move our church forward wrote turkson who if elected would become the first african pontiff since pope gelasius i died more than one thousand five hundred years ago
another leading candidate cardinal timothy dolan of new york told the people of his archdiocese in a blog post friday that he misses new york and is sorry he won't be there on st. patrick's day
heartfelt thanks for your prayers
we need them
we feel them
keep them up
dolan wrote
cardinal roger mahony the retired archbishop of los angeles also asked for prayers before friday evening's meeting
i hope we vote this evening to set the starting date for the conclave
preceded by the mass to elect a new pope
prayers please
he posted to twitter
the chimney used to send up the smoke signals that announce whether or not a new pope has been elected could be raised over the sistine chapel on friday said the rev

opinion
what the next pope will face
the building was closed to tourists tuesday and will remain so for the foreseeable future the vatican said
work is well under way to transform it for the conclave
the cardinals have sworn an oath of secrecy
nonetheless the vatican is taking no chances
an electronic shield will be put up around the conclave to prevent the use of mobile phones and other devices that might allow communication with the outside world
what africans want from the next pope
however lombardi denied a report in the italian media that the cardinals will be searched as they go in and out of the conclave
among the things the cardinals have to do is draw lots for which rooms they get at the casa santa marta the hotel within the walls of vatican city where they stay during the conclave
the hotel also contains a suite where the newly elected pope will live for a few weeks before moving to the papal apartments
the apartments were placed under seal after benedict xvi left last week and must be renovated before the new pope can take up residence the vatican said

british newspapers are abuzz with speculation that prince william's pregnant wife catherine is expecting a girl after a member of the public reported hearing what seemed to be a hint that a daughter is on the way
the duchess of cambridge was talking to people who turned out to welcome her as she visited the coastal town of grimsby in northeast england on tuesday when the apparent slip of the tongue was made

the sistine chapel is closing to the public tuesday afternoon so that catholic officials can prepare for an eventual conclave to elect a new pope the vatican announced
catholic cardinals have yet to announce when the conclave to elect pope benedict xvi's successor would start
on monday they began a series of meetings designed to among other things decide when the conclave will begin
they were due to continue these meetings known as general congregations tuesday and wednesday
the closure of the sistine chapel where the conclave will be held was scheduled for one p.m. local time

the secret election to pick a new pope has yet to begin
but whoever is picked may already be mulling over his choice of name and what it means
in the long history of popes stretching back two millennia to st. peter some names have picked up negative associations while others have come to signify conservatism or a desire for change
so what the new pontiff chooses may be one of the first clues to the course he intends to steer for the world's one point two billion roman catholics
for example pius xii who served from one thousand nine hundred and thirty nine to one thousand nine hundred and fifty eight was very conservative said eminent italian church historian alberto melloni
if the new pope was to call himself pius xiii it would be a very ideological choice he said
on the other side of the coin a new pope that named himself john xxiv would be signaling an openness to reform
john xxiii was famed for calling the second vatican council in one thousand nine hundred and sixty two which ushered in great changes in the roman catholic church's relationship with the modern world
he was brave to pick the name john at all says melloni since the last man to hold the name is viewed as an antipope because he was elected pontiff during a schism in the church in the fifteen th century
john xxiii got away with it because he said it was in deference to his parish saint john the baptist melloni said
benedict xvi who gets to keep his name in rather than reverting to joseph ratzinger in his unprecedented position as pope emeritus meant his choice to be unifying
in his first general audience after taking office in two thousand and five he told the crowds gathered in st. peter's square that he wished to follow in the steps of benedict xv who led the church through the turbulent years of the first world war
he was a true and courageous prophet of peace who struggled strenuously and bravely first to avoid the drama of war and then to limit its terrible consequences benedict xvi said
in his footsteps i place my ministry in the service of reconciliation and harmony between peoples
the choice also evoked st. benedict founder of the benedictine order of monks who helped spread christianity throughout europe and was particularly venerated in ratzinger's homeland germany
for the early popes the choice of a name wasn't an issue
it wasn't until the end of the ten th century that the head of the church started taking a different name to the one he was born with said melloni
but since then only one adrian vi in the sixteen th century has kept his baptismal name
some were monks from countries other than italy who wanted to create a link through their names to the great saints of rome
this was the start of the long list of popes named leo gregory and benedict said melloni
in fact he added the practice can be seen as typical of a dynasty without sons and daughters creating a sense of succession and a link to the earliest names in the church
in the twenty th century john paul i was the first to create a composite name in tribute to the two popes who had led the church through the second vatican council which closed under paul vi following john xxiii's death
he died barely more than a month later putting him among the shortest lived of popes
john paul ii born karol wojtyla in poland making him the first non italian pope since the sixteen th century in turn wanted to show homage to that brief pontificate through carrying on the name said melloni
as the one hundred and fifteen cardinal electors prepare to meet in the conclave for the secret election to pick a new pope almost certainly from within their number the sense of intrigue will only grow
what you may find in the next few days will be the tendency not to try to guess who will be elected and and what name he will take but to try to define the kind of pope they may hope for said melloni
there is a very conservative party within the cardinals who are hoping for pius xiii or benedict xvii he said
others look to someone like archbishop luis antonio tagle of manila as a possible john paul iii he said while some of the italians who want to see the papacy returned to one of their number talk about paul vii
in any case any cardinal who's in with a shot of the papacy would do well to do his homework
whoever first gains the two thirds plus one share of the vote and is named pope won't have long to think about it
once all the votes are counted the dean of the college of cardinals will ask the newly elected head of the church on the spot if he accepts the role and what he wants to be called
while we wait to hear we can be sure of only one thing according to melloni
the new pope won't be called peter
this is out of respect for the first st. peter the apostle but perhaps also reflects a centuries old prophecy that a peter ii will be the very last pope to serve

a fourth person has died a day after a lumber plant employee shot several people at his company's factory near lucerne switzerland
the shooter killed himself and two other people wednesday and one of seven other people wounded in the incident died thursday morning according to lucerne county police spokesman urs wigger
police have not yet named any of the victims and they had no update thursday on how the other six people were faring
the murder weapon was a sphinx at three hundred and eighty handgun not a military issued weapon wigger said adding that police were investigating how the shooter got the gun and whether he had it legally
the gunman forty two was a long time employee of kronospan a wood panel manufacturer in the village of menznau about thirty kilometers outside lucerne police said
the factory employs three hundred and fifty people according to a lucerne based newspaper
it's unclear why the gunman opened fire as employees were taking a morning break
local media reports suggest the plant has had to cut production because of a reduction in the timber harvest
a statement posted in five languages on kronospan's swiss website on wednesday read
it is with tremendous sadness that we must confirm that there has been a shooting incident at our factory this morning resulting in multiple serious injuries and fatalities
the shock and grief at kronospan is not possible to put into words
the posting also included a hotline number for employees
that hotline has been widely used according to police
representatives for the company's u.s. and uk branches said they had limited information about what happened and offered their condolences
it's a terrible tragedy and our thoughts are with the families of the people who have lost their lives the uk spokesman said
we too are deeply saddened by this tragic event and our thoughts are with our swiss colleagues and the families of those involved said the u.s. spokeswoman
the menznau kronospan factory which makes wood products under the brand name kronoswiss is one of ten plants in seven countries run by the swiss krono group according to the company's website
its u.s. subsidiary kronotex usa says on its website that the company has been a family business since its inception in one thousand eight hundred and ninety seven in austria and its total annual sales exceed one billion dollar

rome in front of rapt crowds pope benedict xvi spoke of moments of struggle as well as joy wednesday during his final public address from a stage set up in st. peter's square
in an unusually personal message he said there had been many days of sunshine but also times when the water was rough
and the lord seemed to sleep
interactive
where does the pope live 
but even as the church passes through stormy seas god will not let her sink he added in what was his final general audience before he steps down thursday evening
those words will be seen by many as a comment on the series of child sex abuse scandals and corruption claims that have rocked the roman catholic church in the course of his pontificate
benedict recounted how when he was asked to be pope eight years ago he had prayed for god's guidance and had felt his presence every day since
it was a part of the journey of the church that has had moments of joy and light but also moments that were not easy he said
dressed all in white and looking serene the pope used his last general audience to call for a renewal of faith and speak of his own spiritual journey through eight years as leader of the world's one point two billion catholics
benedict thanked the cardinals the clergy in rome vatican officials and priests worldwide for their work as well as their congregations saying the heart of a pope extends to the whole world
knowing his strength was fading he had taken the step of resignation well aware of its gravity and novelty but also with a deep peace of mind he said
loving the church also means having the courage to make tough choices he said as he called on the faithful to pray for him and the new pope
benedict gave an insight into the life of the pontiff describing it as without any kind of privacy with his time devoted entirely to the church perhaps particularly difficult for a man known for his love of scholarship
his life in retirement will be simply a return to the private place
my decision is to forgo the exercise of active ministry not revoke it
in order to return to private life not to a life of travel meetings receptions conferences and so on he said
as he finished cheers erupted from the tens of thousands gathered in the square acknowledged by benedict with an open armed embrace
vatican officials said fifty thousand tickets had been handed out for benedict's last general audience but authorities said they had prepared for as many as two hundred thousand people to show up to witness the historic moment in person
the pope in retirement
what to expect
benedict who spoke first in italian also gave greetings in french german and english among other languages reflecting the church's global reach
cnn ireporter joel camaya a priest from the philippines who is studying in rome said it was very moving to be among those gathered in the huge plaza
waves of applause rose up to meet benedict especially when he addressed the pilgrims in different languages
i really felt all the support and all the love the prayers from those who were present he said
after the pope left people's mood was festive with many chatting or singing camaya said but at the same time nostalgic because it's the last time they will hear benedict speak
especially for people who have got used coming here for the audience and for the angelus it's something to be missed he said
those lucky enough to have tickets for the final audience listened from seats in front of st. peter's basilica
among them were many of the roman catholic church's senior clergy
others packed around the edges of the square and surrounding side streets hoping to catch a glimpse of the pontiff
among the crowds were groups of pilgrims who had traveled to rome for the special occasion as well as local residents and curious visitors keen to share in the moment
benedict arrived and left in his popemobile allowing him to pass close by many people in st. peter's square
standing in the glass topped vehicle flanked by security he waved as he slowly made his way along pathways through the crowds
some waved flags and banners as they stood under cold but clear skies
normally in winter the pope would give his weekly wednesday general audience inside a hall within vatican city but the event was moved outside because of the anticipated huge crowds
the pope didn't give the usual brief personal greetings to people afterward but was to meet with delegations of heads of state in vatican city
benedict who stunned the world's catholics when he announced his resignation just over two weeks ago will leave office at eight p.m. local time thursday
at that point a transition period will begin as around one hundred and fifteen cardinals gather in rome to pick a successor in a secretive election known as a conclave
the vatican has been rewriting the rules to cope with an almost unprecedented situation benedict is the first pope to resign in nearly six hundred years
he will meet with the cardinals wednesday and thursday before being flown by helicopter to the papal summer residence at castel gandolfo
there from a balcony he will greet crowds one last time before his resignation takes effect and the swiss guards who by tradition protect the pope ceremonially leave the residence's gate
more details were given tuesday of how the eighty five year old's life in retirement will play out
he will keep the papal title benedict xvi rather than reverting to the name joseph ratzinger and will be referred to as his holiness said the rev
federico lombardi a vatican spokesman
he will also go by the title his holiness pontiff emeritus or pope emeritus
living out of the public eye in a small monastery within vatican city benedict will wear a simple white robe without the papal red cape and will swap his red shoes for brown ones
he is expected to devote his time to prayer and study
catholic author michael walsh told cnn he was unsurprised by benedict's desire for more privacy
he's a rather private man
he wants to get back to his books and his cats he wants to get back to prayer he said
he's obviously coming towards the end of his life he's eighty five so i understand that
but walsh added what i don't understand is that he says he wants to be part of it all which could be disastrous if you take it at face value referring to benedict's promise not to abandon the church
the notion that you have two people that claim to be pope in a sense is really going to be very confusing walsh said
vatican officials have said they don't anticipate any interference from benedict as a new pope takes office
however his influence will be felt in as much as he appointed sixty seven of the cardinals who will enter the conclave
whoever his successor may be will have plenty on his plate from allegations swirling in the italian media that gay clergy may have made themselves vulnerable to blackmail by male prostitutes a claim forcefully denied by the vatican to the festering issue of the church's handling of child abuse by priests
scandal flared again over the weekend as scotland's roman catholic archbishop was accused in a uk newspaper report of inappropriate behavior with priests
cardinal keith o'brien who contests the allegations resigned monday and said he would not attend the conclave
the most rev
philip tartaglia archbishop of glasgow will take his place until a new archbishop is appointed the vatican said wednesday
these are painful and distressing times tartaglia is quoted as saying
the vatican said monday that a report by three cardinals into leaks of secret vatican documents ordered by benedict last year and seen only by him would be passed on to the new pontiff
opinion
how next pope must tackle child sex abuse
meanwhile the cardinals who must elect the new pope are already gathering in rome lombardi said
the dean cardinal will on friday summon the cardinals to a general congregation lombardi said
that could come as soon as monday although the date is not yet fixed
the cardinal electors will then decide exactly when to hold the conclave during which they will select a peer via paper ballot
the voting process will end when only when one cardinal gains two thirds support
after his resignation benedict who cited the frailty of age as the reason he resigned will no longer use the fisherman's ring the symbol of the pope lombardi said
the ring will be destroyed along with benedict's papal seal after his departure from office

with only two full days left of pope benedict xvi's papacy more details emerged tuesday of what the future holds both for the retiring pontiff and the cardinals who will choose his successor
the pontiff will keep the name benedict xvi and still be addressed as his holiness once he retires vatican spokesman federico lombardi told reporters at the vatican
interactive
where does the pope live 
he will also be known as pope emeritus emeritus pope or roman pontifex emeritus
the guidance clears up questions about how benedict the first pope to resign in almost six hundred years should be addressed as he moves into a life of seclusion and prayer after his thursday resignation
benedict will hold his final general audience wednesday for which fifty thousand tickets have been given out lombardi said though many more people than that could show up
the pope in retirement
what to expect
benedict will arrive in his popemobile which will drive around st. peter's square among the faithful before the pope gives the address
he won't give the usual brief personal greetings to people afterward but will meet delegations of heads of state in vatican city later
benedict will meet with the cardinals who are already in rome on thursday morning
the eighty five year old will then be flown by helicopter to castel gandolfo the pope's summer residence near rome in the afternoon
the church bell will toll and he will make his very last public appearance greeting crowds from a balcony there
at the moment that benedict's papacy ends at eight p.m. local time the swiss guards the soldiers who for more than five centuries have protected the pope and his residence will leave the gates of castel gandolfo
he will from that point have vatican police protection instead
benedict will stay there until work to restore a monastery within the vatican grounds is completed later in the spring
meanwhile the cardinals who must elect the new pope are already gathering in rome lombardi said
the dean cardinal will on march one summon the cardinals to a general congregation lombardi said
that could come as soon as march four although the date is not yet fixed
the cardinals will then decide exactly when to hold the conclave during which they vote for the new pontiff
special prayers will be said during the sede vacante or empty seat period seeking guidance for the election of the new pope
the cardinals will lead the prayers
after his resignation benedict who cited the frailty of age as the reason he resigned will no longer use the fisherman's ring the symbol of the pope lombardi said
the ring will be destroyed along with benedict's papal seal after his departure from office
he will wear a simple white cassock without the customary red mantle of the pontiff
he will also no longer wear red shoes probably adopting instead the brown shoes that he received as a gift in leon mexico during a trip last year
benedict shocked the roman catholic world when he announced his resignation two weeks ago
his final week in office has been clouded by scandal with allegations swirling in the italian media that gay clergy may have made themselves vulnerable to blackmail by male prostitutes
vatican secretary of state tarcisio bertone said it was deplorable that as the time for the roman catholic cardinals to elect a new pope approaches a rash of often unverified unverifiable or completely false news stories has appeared
benedict also moved up the resignation monday of a scottish archbishop linked over the weekend by a british newspaper to inappropriate relationships with priests
cardinal keith o'brien the archbishop of scotland told the pope in november that he would resign effective on his seventy five th birthday on march seventeen
but benedict decided to make the resignation effective immediately in light of the pope's imminent resignation the scottish catholic media office said
the announcement came a day after a report by the british sunday newspaper the observer that three priests and one former priest leveled allegations against o'brien that date back thirty years
speaking in london on tuesday one of britain's most senior roman catholics the former archbishop of westminster cardinal cormac murphy o'connor described the circumstances of o'brien's resignation as very sad
murphy o'connor said that it was o'brien's decision to step down and that he had not been forced or asked to do so
he described o'brien as a very honest man
an apostolic administrator most likely a senior bishop will examine the allegations against o'brien murphy o'connor said
he also said he was in no doubt that there needs to be reform within the roman catholic church and that the issues being raised now need to be addressed at the highest level

at the same time as pope benedict xvi leaves office on february twenty eight his twitter presence as pontifex will also come to an end according to vatican radio
the news may come as a sad blow to the more than two million people who've signed up to follow his tweets in nine languages since his account was launched with fanfare two and a half months ago
about one point five million of those people follow the english language feed with nearly seven hundred thousand following him in spanish and just short of three hundred and thirty five thousand in italian
about twenty two thousand five hundred people follow pontifex in latin
the account will be closed to coincide with the eighty five year old pope's formal departure from office at eight p.m. local time vatican radio said
it seems unimaginable that one could continue to use a communication tool so popular and powerful during the sede vacante period vatican radio said referring to the time during which the seat will be empty
from choice the pontifex profile was not personalized but it clearly refers to the person of the pope
it's not yet clear whether whoever is chosen to succeed benedict who cited the frailty of age as the reason for his departure will also use twitter to reach out to some of the one point five billion roman catholics around the world
on february ten the day before the pope announced his shock resignation pontifex tweeted
we must trust in the mighty power of god's mercy
we are all sinners but his grace transforms us and makes us new
only two tweets have been posted since in english both relating to the lent period
according to vatican radio benedict is likely to offer his last tweet on february twenty seven the same day that he will give his final general audience to huge crowds expected to gather in st. peter's square in vatican city
if not then perhaps one final thought will come from benedict on february twenty eight before retiring into silence it suggests
the pontiff is considering changing the vatican constitution to allow a vote for his successor to begin before march fifteen vatican spokesman the rev
federico lombardi said wednesday
existing rules say the roman catholic church's cardinals should start voting on a replacement from fifteen to twenty days after the papal throne becomes vacant
with benedict's resignation due to start on february twenty eight the cardinals conclave ordinarily would start no sooner than march fifteen
but lombardi has said that because benedict was leaving the papacy through resignation rather than death the vatican would explore the possibility of selecting a new pope sooner than normally prescribed

new delhi uk prime minister david cameron visited the site of the infamous one thousand nine hundred and nineteen amritsar massacre by british troops in india on wednesday but those hoping he might apologize for the atrocity were disappointed
cameron the first serving british prime minister to visit amritsar a sikh holy city in the northwestern state of punjab laid a wreath at a memorial to the hundreds killed in the massacre
writing in a book of condolences at the jallianwala bagh memorial he described the massacre as a deeply shameful event in british history
he added we must never forget what happened here
however he did not give a formal apology for the atrocity which occurred while india was part of the british empire
a spokesman for cameron said the british state had always described the massacre as monstrous but that we need to be careful about going around apologizing for things that happened forty years before the prime minister was born
cameron's trip to india is focused on promoting closer trade and business links
queen elizabeth ii and her husband prince philip previously visited amritsar in one thousand nine hundred and ninety seven
in one thousand nine hundred and twenty then cabinet minister winston churchill condemned the massacre as an episode which appears to me to be without precedent or parallel in the modern history of the british empire
it is an extraordinary event a monstrous event an event which stands in singular and sinister isolation
the atrocity occurred when a british army general ordered troops to open fire to disperse a crowd of unarmed protesters who had gathered in jallianwala bagh amritsar
a report by a british led committee in the wake of the massacre put the number killed at close to four hundred with three to four times as many people injured
indian observers put the number killed at more than one thousand

same sex marriage in france came one step closer to legality tuesday as lawmakers in the lower house of parliament approved a controversial bill that would extend the right to marry and adopt to same sex couples
the measure was voted through in the national assembly by three hundred and twenty nine in favor to two hundred and twenty nine against with ten deputies abstaining
the bill must still go before the senate before it becomes law
if passed it would mark the biggest step forward for french gay rights advocates in more than a decade
france is not the only nation currently wrestling with the polarizing issue of same sex marriage
uk lawmakers took a big step last week toward legalizing same sex marriage when they approved the second reading of a bill in the house of commons
but while a significant number of mps back the legislation which is supported by prime minister david cameron the move has prompted widespread rebellion within cameron's conservative party
the bill must go through several more stages before it can become law
the church of england is among the religious bodies opposed to the uk legislation
in the united states where president barack obama has voiced his personal support for same sex marriage it has been legalized in nine states and the district of columbia but many people remain vehemently opposed
extending the right to marry and adopt to same sex couples in france was one of president francois hollande's electoral pledges in campaigning last year
opinion
why the fuss about gay marriage 
the national assembly which is dominated by hollande's socialist party was expected to pass the bill tuesday having approved the most important article of the law with a wide majority earlier this month
the left also controls the senate
but the plan faces stiff opposition from the roman catholic church and social conservatives with huge numbers turning out for protest marches in paris in recent weeks
another big rally against the law is planned for next month
cardinal andre vingt trois the archbishop of paris voiced his opposition at a meeting of french bishops in lourdes last year
opening up marriage to same sex couples would be a transformation of marriage that would affect everyone he said
at the same time failing to recognize gender difference within marriage and the family would be a deceit that would rock the foundations of society and lead to discrimination between children he said
other religious groups including muslims jews and buddhists have also expressed their concern over the draft bill and many lawmakers and hundreds of mayors are against the legislation
the legislation has won wide backing from gay rights advocates however
the french gay lesbian and transgender rights group inter lgbt has said the law if passed would be a major advance for our country in terms of equality of rights
lawmakers have a unique opportunity to put an end to outdated discrimination the group said in a statement
the law must allow all couples to unite themselves as they wish and must protect all families without discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation or gender identity it said
a law legalizing civil unions was introduced in one thousand nine hundred and ninety nine in france under a previous socialist government
known in france as the pacs the civil union agreement can be entered into by gay or straight couples and confers many but not all of the rights of marriage
opinion
gay rights in france how even the u.s. leads the way
argentina belgium canada spain south africa and norway are among nearly a dozen countries that allow same sex marriages
polls show the u.s. public has gradually become more accepting of the idea with more americans in favor in two thousand and thirteen than opposed according to pew
nonetheless thirty states have passed constitutional amendments banning same sex marriage according to the pew research center
the issue has also divided australia where lawmakers voted against a bill to legalize same sex marriage last september
a poll for the advocacy group australian marriage equality indicated that sixty four percents of those surveyed support marriage equality
according to a report released in may two thousand and eleven by the international lesbian gay bisexual trans and intersex association same sex relations are still criminalized in seventy six countries and in five of those countries the death penalty can be applied to those who violate the laws

uk lawmakers took a big step tuesday toward legalizing same sex marriage an issue that has prompted widespread rebellion within prime minister david cameron's conservative party
in a four hundred one hundred and seventy five vote mps approved the second reading of a bill legalizing such marriage indicating a significant majority of members support the measure
however it must go through several more stages before it can become law
the bill faces another vote in the house of commons and a vote in the house of lords
before tuesday's vote three top party members appealed to conservative mps to get behind the controversial legislation in a letter published in the telegraph newspaper
the letter signed by chancellor george osborne foreign secretary william hague and home secretary theresa may said that passing the bill is the right thing to do at the right time
the institution of marriage has evolved over time the letter said while attitudes towards gay people have changed
in a direct appeal to fellow party members the trio added
we believe that opening it up to same sex couples will strengthen not weaken the institution
as david cameron has said we should support gay marriage not in spite of being conservatives but because we are conservatives
their attitude was echoed by kate green a labour mp during debate
tuesday's reading was the first opportunity for lawmakers in the house of commons to debate the bill in detail
by recognizing and extending the definition of marriage to reflect today's greater openness towards and recognition of same sex relationships the legislation does not weaken the institution of marriage
on the contrary it takes it forward it strengthens it
it helps to perpetuate it she said
the legislation passed the house of commons with the support of lawmakers from labour and the liberal democrats
the latter are in a coalition government with the conservatives
as drafted the bill would enable religious organizations to choose to conduct same sex marriages if they wish and includes provisions intended to make sure no religious organization or person is forced to do so
the church of england is among the religious bodies opposed to the legislation
the bill would also allow same sex couples to convert a civil partnership to a marriage and enable married transsexual people to gain legal recognition in their acquired gender without having to end their marriages
a law recognizing civil partnerships in england and wales was passed in two thousand and four
tony and barrie drewitt barlow who are already same sex civil partners and have five children together told cnn that it was important to them to be able to marry in front of their fellow churchgoers
we want to be able to go into our local parish church where we are practicing christians and under the eyes of the lord get married said barrie drewitt barlow
i don't want to go in front of a vicar or priest who doesn't want to do it
it's supposed to be the happiest day of my life
i want to be really happy and joyous when i get married to the man that i've been together with for twenty five years
his partner tony said it was a question of equality
marriage is all about the union of two people that love each other and want to bind that love in a relationship that lasts forever
and for me it's about having that right for everybody gay straight or bisexual he said
whatever you are if you love that person then you should have the rights to be joined in matrimony with them
cameron has said he is determined to push through legislation allowing same sex marriage not only as someone who believes in equality but as someone who believes passionately in marriage
priests in same sex relationships may become anglican bishops
but his commitment to that aim has set him at odds with many in his own party
a number of local party members wrote to the prime minister sunday urging him to reconsider
we feel very strongly that the decision to bring this bill before parliament has been made without adequate debate or consultation with either the membership of the conservative party or with the country at large said the letter published on the conservative grassroots website
long held religious and personal freedoms and the right to free speech will be adversely affected by the passing of this bill
the church of england also outlined its objections to the bill in a briefing note sent to lawmakers friday
it can not support the legislation because of its concern for the uncertain and unforeseen consequences for wider society and the common good when marriage is redefined in gender neutral terms it said
it also argues that civil partnerships already confer the same rights as marriage and that allowing same sex couples to marry will open the door to continued legal disputes for years to come
the issue of same sex marriage has also prompted wide disagreement elsewhere
lawmakers in france's lower house of parliament the national assembly on saturday passed with a wide majority the most important article of a law to legalize same sex marriage
debate will continue for the next week on thousands of proposed amendments to the law which would also open adoption to same sex couples
the vote by french lawmakers followed big public protests against the bill which has proved highly divisive in the majority catholic country
in the united states where president barack obama has voiced his personal support for same sex marriage it has been legalized in nine states and the district of columbia
at the same time thirty states have passed constitutional amendments banning same sex marriage according to the pew research center
polls show the u.s. public has gradually become more accepting of same sex marriage with more americans in favor in two thousand and thirteen than opposed according to pew

as was the case exactly two years ago before president hosni mubarak's ouster streets around egypt were roiled by deadly clashes friday pitting protesters against both police and supporters of the nation's current leader
at least seven people were killed six of them in suez where gunfire erupted during clashes between anti government protesters and those loyal to president mohamed morsy according to official media outlets
four of those killed in suez had been shot in the abdomen health ministry spokesman ahmed omar told state run egynews
it was not clear which group those killed belonged to or who was responsible
the head of security in suez denied his forces fired on protesters state tv reported
by saturday morning egyptian armored vehicles were dispersed around suez at the request of the city's security chief who had said his forces were fired upon and feared the situation was getting out of control egynews reported
yet the unrest was not confined to the coastal city of suez on the northern tip of the red sea
the seventh death was in ismailia according to egynews
nationwide at least four hundred and fifty six people including dozens of police and security forces though the vast majority were civilians were injured throughout the day health ministry officials said
into saturday morning after the anniversary of what some call the january twenty five revolution officially had passed thousands of protesters were still in a standoff with police outside state run nile tv's offices in cairo
some demonstrators there tossed molotov cocktails while police responded with tear gas
the unrest comes as egypt continues its struggle to find stability security and harmony after the ouster of mubarak who in his thirty years of ruling egypt was accused of vigorously clamping down on dissent
he has been given a life sentence for his role in the killings of peaceful protesters demanding his exit though he will get a new trial in april the state run mena news agency reported this month
morsy who became the north african country's first democratically elected president last year has since become a target for some who say he hasn't been inclusive or true to the revolution's goals
those critics say he has amassed power for himself and his islamist allies
morsy was a leader in the muslim brotherhood the islamist group that was banned under mubarak before he rose to power

u.s gets it wrong on egypt again
there also were protests in cairo's tahrir square the hub of the popular movement that began its push on january twenty five two thousand and eleven to unseat mubarak
back then protesters spilled into the streets around that major intersection in an unprecedented display of anti government rage
at one point the activist masses in the world's largest arab nation broke through riot police who had lined tahrir or liberation square
police lobbed tear gas and used water cannon but the protesters were undaunted
since then the square has continued to be a focal point for demonstrations for egyptians from all factions
that was true again friday and by afternoon at least ten thousand liberals moderates and secularists had gathered there to vent their anger at morsy and the muslim brotherhood for in their view hijacking the revolution
all ages all classes women even more enthusiastic than men cnn ireporter dr. abdel maguid ramzy said of the crowd he joined for four hours in tahrir square many of whom blamed morsy and the muslim brotherhood for egypt's economic malaise
they feel betrayed
one pocket of violence broke out a few blocks from the square where police erected a barrier of concrete blocks on a street leading to the interior ministry and other government buildings
young protesters threw rocks over the barrier at officers stationed there who responded sporadically with tear gas or threw stones themselves
at least twenty nine people were treated for cuts broken bones and birdshot injuries health ministry spokesman khaled el khatib said
six police officers were also hurt in the disorder near tahrir square according to the interior ministry

british prime minister david cameron promised wednesday that a vote will be held on britain's membership in the european union if his party wins the next election in two thousand and fifteen
should britain stay in the eu 
what would the impact be if it left 
send us your thoughts
cameron said the british people should have a choice about whether to remain in the eu on the basis of a renegotiated settlement or to leave
the referendum should not be held until it's clear how changes made after the crisis in the eurozone work out he said while giving a landmark speech on europe
but he said it is important to ask difficult questions about the future now
otherwise british people could drift towards the exit if europe fails
the key problems europe faces are instability in the eurozone a crisis of european competitiveness as other nations across the world soar ahead and a lack of democratic accountability cameron said
there is a gap between the eu and its citizens which has grown dramatically in recent years he said
as a result democratic consent for the eu in britain is now wafer thin he said and public disillusionment is at an all time high
it is time to settle this european question in british politics he said
i say to the british people
this will be your decision
the british prime minister insisted that he is not an isolationist saying he would like britain to remain part of europe on the right terms with the single market and competitiveness at the heart of the relationship
and he set out a vision for an updated european union that is more flexible more adaptable more open fit for the challenges of the modern age and said all options should be on the table to negotiate a new deal
he also warned that leaving the european union would be a one way ticket with no option of return
over the coming weeks months and years i will not rest until this debate is won for the future of my country for the success of the european union and the prosperity of our peoples for generations to come he concluded
cameron promised a vote in the first half of the next parliament if his party which is currently in a coalition government with the liberal democrats wins the general election due in two thousand and fifteen
the prime minister has been under concerted pressure from some members of his party to hold a referendum on europe
the so called eurosceptics want to see britain get some powers back from the eu as well as a reduction in legislation they say holds back businesses
however others both in and outside the party warn that creating uncertainty about britain's membership in the european union risks undermining the confidence of businesses and industry at a critical time
fellow european nations may also be unwilling to renegotiate the terms of britain's membership
france and others have made it clear that cameron can not cherry pick which elements of the european union he signs up to or risk unraveling the union to suit british interests
french foreign minister laurent fabius told radio station france info that the planned referendum risks being dangerous for britain itself because britain outside of europe that will be difficult
if britain did decide to leave the european union france would roll out the red carpet for business leaders fabius added
italian prime minister mario monti speaking at the world economic forum in davos switzerland predicted britain would remain in the eu
i am confident that if there is to be a referendum one day the uk citizens will decide to stay in the eu and contribute to shape its future he said
i think the eu does not need unwilling europeans
britain is a net contributor to the european union and an important player in the single market which may give cameron some additional sway but critics warn he is taking a big gamble
former belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt warned against trying hold the eu to ransom
verhofstadt who leads the alliance of liberals and democrats for europe in the european parliament said cameron's speech was filled with inconsistencies and showed a degree of ignorance about how the eu works
new year same old problems 
by holding out the prospect of renegotiating the terms of britain's membership of the eu and subjecting it to a referendum david cameron is playing with fire he said
u.s. president barack obama last week told cameron that the united states values a strong uk in a strong european union
and philip gordon the u.s. assistant secretary for european affairs also made it clear that there would be consequences for britain if it either left the eu or played a lesser role in brussels
we have a growing relationship with the eu as an institution which has an increasing voice in the world and we want to see a strong british voice in that eu he told reporters at the u.s. embassy in london
that is in america's interests
we welcome an outward looking eu with britain in it
markets across europe were flat wednesday morning after cameron's speech including in london
labour leader ed miliband said ahead of cameron's address that it would define him as a weak prime minister being driven by his party not by the national economic interest
miliband said tuesday that cameron had rejected the idea of an in out referendum on europe in october two thousand and eleven because of the doubts it would foster
the only thing that has changed since then is he has lost control of his party and is too weak to do what is right for the country miliband said
everyone knows that the priority for britain is the jobs and growth that we need
we have had warning after warning from british business about the dangers of creating years of uncertainty for britain
cameron also lacks the support of his party's coalition partner the liberal democrats for the move
party leader and deputy prime minister nick clegg told uk media that creating years of uncertainty over britain's place in europe was not in the national interest at this time
cameron's conservative party faces a growing domestic political threat from the uk independence party or ukip which wants britain to withdraw fully from the eu
ukip leader nigel farage who is also a member of the european parliament said cameron's speech wednesday had defined the national debate about our place in the european union
no longer can the case for british withdrawal be confined to the margins
the genie is out of the bottle
but farage questioned whether cameron is truly committed to reclaiming powers from the european union or is just seeking to win votes
daniel wilsher an expert in eu law at city university london said cameron will need to come up with some convincing bargaining chips if he wants to persuade other eu members to negotiate a new deal
cameron's threat to wield britain's veto over treaty changes to deepen ties within the eurozone will not be enough wilsher said
the british prime minister also focused on the importance of the single market wilsher said but membership in this is tied to eu rules regarding workers rights consumer safety and environmental protection
to opt out of certain laws such as the eu directive on working hours is legally difficult and would disturb a premise of the single market he said
overall it would be very hard to change the fundamentals without allowing every country to pick on its own pet hates
president of the european parliament martin schulz had a similar view tweeting
cameron's europe a la carte not an option
we have to focus on jobs and growth rather than getting lost in treaties discussions
cameron was due to give the speech on europe last week but had to postpone its delivery because of the algerian hostage crisis
should britain stay in or leave the european union 
what would be the impact on you or your country if it left

a federal prosecutor is pushing back against the claim by the grieving family of internet activist aaron swartz that prosecutorial overreach was a factor in his suicide saying her office acted fairly and responsibly
news of the death of swartz twenty six last friday sent shock waves through the hacker community the massachusetts institute of technology and the larger online world
his family and partner issued a statement saying that federal charges filed over allegations that he stole millions of online documents mostly scholarly papers from mit through the university's computer network contributed to swartz's decision to take his own life
but the u.s. attorney for massachusetts carmen m. ortiz disputed their account of events in a statement released late wednesday while expressing her sympathy as a parent and a sister for their loss
i know that there is little i can say to abate the anger felt by those who believe that this office's prosecution of mr. swartz was unwarranted and somehow led to the tragic result of him taking his own life she said
i must however make clear that this office's conduct was appropriate in bringing and handling this case
the career prosecutors handling this matter took on the difficult task of enforcing a law they had taken an oath to uphold and did so reasonably
if convicted on the federal computer fraud charges he faced swartz could have been sentenced to thirty five years in prison or a hefty fine
however ortiz said prosecutors recognized there was no evidence swartz had acted for personal gain and considered that the harshest penalties available under the law were not appropriate for his alleged offenses
as a result prosecutors told swartz's legal team they would recommend to the judge a sentence of six months in a low security setting she said
at the same time swartz's defense was free to suggest to the judge that probation would be more appropriate ortiz said and the final call would lay with the judge
at no time did this office ever seek or ever tell mr. swartz's attorneys that it intended to seek maximum penalties under the law she concluded
as federal prosecutors our mission includes protecting the use of computers and the internet by enforcing the law as fairly and responsibly as possible
we strive to do our best to fulfill this mission every day
ortiz dropped the charges against swartz on monday a day before his funeral in highland park illinois
the statement from swartz's family and partner had called his death the product of a criminal justice system rife with intimidation and prosecutorial overreach
it also criticized u.s. prosecutors because they sought an exceptionally harsh array of charges an alleged crime that had no victims and mit because it did not stand up for aaron
decisions made by officials in the massachusetts u.s. attorney's office and at mit contributed to his death his loved ones said
swartz's suicide inspired a flurry of online tributes and mobilized anonymous the loosely defined collective of so called hacktivists who oppose attempts to limit internet freedoms
they claimed credit late sunday for defacing several mit websites
a white house petition to remove united states district attorney carmen ortiz from office for overreach in the case of aaron swartz was set up saturday
by thursday it had garnered more than forty thousand signatures
swartz widely regarded as a digital prodigy helped develop social news site reddit and rss the technology that allows websites to send updates to subscribers at a young age
on leaving reddit he engaged in internet digital activism co founding demand progress a political action group that campaigns against internet censorship
but he pushed the legal limits allegedly putting him on the wrong side of the law
in two thousand and eleven he was arrested in boston and accused of computer fraud and illegally obtaining documents from protected computers
he was later indicted in an incident in which he allegedly stole millions of online documents from the massachusetts institute of technology
he pleaded not guilty in september according to mit's the tech newspaper
he had previously been investigated by the fbi after he released millions of u.s. federal court documents online
the alleged hacking was significant because the documents came from the government run public access to court electronic records or pacer which typically charges a fee which in two thousand and nine was eight cents a page

islamists attacked a gas field in eastern algeria killing two people and seizing hostages including westerners algeria's interior minister said wednesday
the incident may be linked to france's military support for the government of nearby mali according to reports from the region
the westerners accompanied by algerian security forces were en route to in amenas airport when they were attacked early in the morning by a group of no more than twenty people the official diho weld qabliyeh told algerian state television
the security forces returned fire and the attackers withdrew to the base of the petroleum operation some three kilometers away he said
upon arrival at the base he continued the attackers took in a number of westerners and algerians some people told us they were nine some people told us twelve
u.s. state department spokeswoman victoria nuland said americans were among the hostages
an algerian and a westerner were killed in the attack and two other westerners two of the security forces and two guards from the base were wounded qabliyeh said
a spokesperson for britain's foreign office citing the algerian government said a british national was among the dead
british foreign minister william hague speaking in sydney australia said the captives included a number of british nationals
hague said the foreign office had sent a rapid deployment team to algiers to beef up staffing at the embassy
algerian military forces were surrounding the building holding the hostage takers and the hostages qabliyeh said
late wednesday the hostage takers released the algerians they had been holding but continued holding the westerners algerian state television reported
the group has issued demands but they elicited no response qabliyeh said
the authorities do not negotiate no negotiations
we have received their demands but we didn't respond to them he added
a mauritanian news agency al akhbar said the attackers demanded in a news release an end to brutal aggression on our people in mali
it cited blatant intervention of the french crusader forces in mali and accused the world of having left syria's people groaning under the pressure of the butcher president bashar al assad
the news release said they chose to carry out the operation in algeria because the country's president abdelaziz bouteflika had allowed french military forces to cross algerian air space in attacking mali
a u.s. official was skeptical
the level of planning suggests that this was in train before the french overflights ever took place the official said
that view was echoed by another u.s. official who told cnn's erin burnett that as of now the attack appeared organized not put together quickly or opportunistic
the official said it was likely that the attackers had cited algeria's opening of its air space to french fighters as the reason for the attack to protect their operational methods and make the attack appear spontaneous
the news release put the number of hostages at more than forty including seven americans two french two british and a number of other europeans
an islamist group claiming responsibility for the attack told the mauritanian news agency and sahara media that forty one westerners including seven americans french british and japanese citizens have been taken hostage
but the real number of u.s. hostages could be as few as three two u.s. officials said wednesday
the algerian press service citing a source from the provincial administration of illizi reported that a little more than twenty foreign nationals are held hostage
defense secretary leon panetta in europe meeting with nato allies called the incident a terrorist attack
nine or ten americans were working at the site and u.s. officials were trying to determine who had been abducted a state department official told cnn
the source said the abductors were demanding that members of their group being held prisoner be released and sent to northern mali
the official was not clear about where the prisoners were
the first priority is to gain understanding of what is happening a senior u.s. official with direct knowledge of the matter said
we are working on ways to improve that now
the official added that a special operations team the commanders in extremis force is on a very short string
he said that another important piece will be for libya to really lock down the nearby border on their side so personnel and weapons can not get through
a u.s. official said the capability existed to see the area around the facility and that the ability to monitor the situation will improve soon
the cif unit is prepared to move within four hours of being ordered to do so a u.s. defense official told cnn
the official said that before the hostage incident the unit had been headed to senegal where it was to be on standby for missions in mali but that it may now move elsewhere
a second u.s. official said that any operation would take time to unfold
this is not the type of mission that you plan and execute overnight it's just not the official said
we don't know specifically how many militants or hostages there are
but with so little information if you're talking dozens of militants and up to forty hostages i don't see how you go in without killing half the hostages
the second official said that marine corps fleet antiterrorism security teams would be deployed only to augment security at any nearby embassies
none is under threat
they would not be deployed for field operations in any rescue attempt the official said
the pentagon's africa command is taking the military lead on the matter and the state department and fbi are the lead agencies in contact with the algerian government a defense official said
the official said commanders have assets not too far away including aircraft from the air force's base in aviano italy and a marine corps fast team in sigonella italy
any action would need to be approved by algeria which is more than just a formality the official said
a spokesman for the group whose name means those who sign with blood said that jihadists controlled the plant
saying that the operation was an act of revenge against algeria the spokesman said four hundred algerian soldiers were on the site who have not been targeted by jihadists
a spokesman for the norwegian prime minister's office told cnn that thirteen norwegians all employees of statoil are involved in the incident at amenas gas field in algeria
the uk foreign office said british nationals were caught up in the incident
ireland's foreign minister said there were reports that an irish citizen was involved
the office of the french president refused comment on reports that french citizens were among the hostages
oil giant bp which operates the in amenas field in a joint venture with sonatrac the algerian national oil company and norway's statoil said it was attacked by unidentified armed people who were occupying the site
statoil executive vice president lars christian bacher said seventeen of its employees thirteen of them norwegian were in or around the facility at the time of the attack
we have received information that five of the seventeen are brought to safety in a military camp in the area he said in a statement
four are norwegian and one is a canadian resident
two people were injured and have received medical treatment he said
the gas field lies about sixty kilometers west of the libyan border and some one thousand three hundred kilometers from the capital algiers bp said
the attack comes four days after libyan algerian and tunisian prime ministers reached security agreements during a summit in libya where they agreed to work together against terrorist threats
in a statement rep. ed royce r california called the attack the latest demonstration of a large and growing radical movement across north africa and said the french have acted appropriately in intervening in mali

britain's late tv presenter and radio host jimmy savile sexually abused hundreds of people and carried out more than thirty rapes police said friday as they unveiled a report exposing vast predatory and opportunistic abuses across six decades
nearly three quarters of his victims were children the report said with the youngest only eight years old
most but not all were female

victim tells of abuse at hands of savile
since the inquiry was launched three months ago about six hundred people have come forward to provide information four hundred and fifty relating to savile london's metropolitan police said
from this two hundred and fourteen crimes have been recorded including thirty four of rape or penetration across the country
the earliest claim against savile who was still a household name when he died in two thousand and eleven dates from one thousand nine hundred and fifty five and the latest from two thousand and nine when he was in his eighty s
savile used his celebrity to hide in plain sight as he opportunistically preyed on the children and young people with whom he came into contact as he presented bbc children's show jim'll fix it and music show top of the pops the report said
dozens of offenses on bbc premises have been reported across a forty year span between one thousand nine hundred and sixty five and two thousand and six the last at the final recording of top of the pops
fifty allegations against savile relate to hospital premises including hospices the report said
another fourteen relate to schools including a reform school he visited regularly between one thousand nine hundred and seventy and one thousand nine hundred and seventy eight
the scale of his abuse is believed to be unprecedented in the uk it said
the report by london's metropolitan police and a child protection charity the nspcc titled giving victims a voice brings to a close a sordid chapter
police set up operation yewtree to investigate sexual abuse claims after a documentary by broadcaster itv in october unleashed a flood of allegations against the star who before that was seen as an eccentric but charismatic man who raised millions of pounds for charity

how celebrity child sex scandal has rocked the bbc
the investigation had three strands
one involving complaints against savile alone another termed savile and others and a third involving only others
the publication of the report ends the first strand of the inquiry
however investigations continue into allegations made against the other suspects some linked to savile and others not
a number of arrests have been made
it paints a stark picture emphasizing the tragic consequences of when vulnerability and power collide commander peter spindler of the metropolitan police said of the report
savile's offending footprint was vast predatory and opportunistic
he can not face justice today but we hope this report gives some comfort to his hundreds of victims they have been listened to and taken seriously
we must use the learning from these shocking events to prevent other children and vulnerable adults being abused in the future
they will get a voice
the bbc whose reputation has been tainted by the affair said it would continue to work with police to investigate the claims
the police report into jimmy savile contains shocking revelations a statement said
as we have made clear the bbc is appalled that some of the offences were committed on its premises
we would like to restate our sincere apology to the victims of these crimes
the bbc set up three inquiries of its own amid questions about how savile's abuses went undetected for so long
one is looking at the culture and practices within the bbc and another at its handling of past sexual harassment claims
the third which reported on the broadcaster's decision to drop a program investigating allegations savile in late two thousand and eleven slammed senior management as completely incapable of dealing with the crisis that erupted
the bbc's botched handling of the affair forced the director general george entwistle to resign
the uk department of health which is conducting its own investigation into the access savile had to hospitals and other institutions said the police report highlights the shocking scale of offending by jimmy savile over five decades and shows the need to learn lessons from his crimes
with the police review concluded civil claims are likely to be brought as some victims seek compensation for the abuse they suffered at savile's hands
about seventy three percents of them were younger than eighteen when they were targeted
four fifths of the victims were girls and women the report said
the majority of the victims were between the ages of thirteen and sixteen at the time of the abuse and the oldest was forty seven
of the thirty four reported offenses of rape or penetration twenty six victims were female and eight were male police said
there is no clear evidence of savile operating within a paedophile ring although whether he was part of an informal network is part of the continuing investigation the report added
most of the alleged offenses were committed around the city of leeds where savile lived and in london where he worked
the peak of offending reported to police was between one thousand nine hundred and sixty six and one thousand nine hundred and seventy six when savile was between forty and fifty years old
separately a review by the crown prosecution service was critical of the decision by two police forces not to file charges against savile after investigating four separate allegations of sexual abuse
in two thousand and seven and two thousand and eight surrey police investigated three complaints that he had engaged in sexual behavior with young girls
during the same period sussex police investigated a complaint by a young woman
alison levitt chief legal adviser to the director of public prosecutions said police were too cautious in their approach and should have asked more questions to push inquiries forward
the alleged victims and their accounts were treated with a degree of caution which was neither justified nor required she said
having spoken to the victims i have been driven to conclude that had the police and prosecutors taken a different approach a prosecution might have been possible
peter watt director of child protection advice for the nspcc said the scale of savile's abuse simply beggared belief
but he added one positive is that nearly eight hundred additional children have been protected from abuse because the publicity around the savile case has encouraged people to call the charity's helpline
for many it's the first time they've spoken out about abuse he said
we are optimistic that this signals a watershed moment for child protection in this country
we must seize the opportunity if we are to make a lasting change he said
the report's authors acknowledge that it is too late to act on the claims against savile but they say the investigation met the need for hundreds of victims to have official recognition of the serious crimes they have suffered and to know they have been taken seriously
millions of britons who grew up watching savile on tv's top of the pops and jim'll fix it were shocked by the fall from grace of an entertainer who'd been awarded knighthoods by queen elizabeth ii and the late pope john paul ii for his charitable work
savile died in october two thousand and eleven at age eighty four soon after being treated in a hospital for pneumonia
his death was followed by a series of glowing tributes including bbc specials

its two djs mel greig and michael christian continued to tweet about the call on thursday and earlier friday promising more on the royalprank
talking about the call on air thursday greig said
they were the world's worst accents ever
we were sure one hundred people at least before us would've tried the same thing

we were expecting to be hung up on we didn't even know what to say when we got through
some listeners applauded the prank like one who identified himself as guido on the station's facebook page and wrote it is only a joke people
it was great i love it
others were outraged with such negative views outnumbering positive ones on two dayfm's before the nurse's death
your stunt was done at a time in this country where there is paranoia about the intrusion of the media into people's lives gary slenders wrote
i know you will say it is harmless fun the management of two dayfm will say that it won't happen again but this exactly where the phone hacking scandal started
the outcry grew exponentially after saldanha's death leading the coles supermarket chain to remove all its advertising from two day fm in response
by friday evening a spokeswoman for the station told cnn in a statement that the pair will not return to the show until further notice out of respect for what can only be described as a tragedy
she said greig and christian whose twitter accounts have been taken down were deeply shocked by the incident
rhys holleran ceo of the southern cross austereo media group echoed those facts and views in a press conference saturday afternoon saying the company and djs mutually decided they would be off the air for an undetermined period
holleran said he'd spoken with greig and christian on saturday morning and they were deeply shattered and our concern is for their welfare
the ceo added that he is very confident that we haven't done anything illegal
this is a tragic event that could not have been reasonably foreseen and we are deeply saddened by it he said of saldanha's death
that view isn't shared by everyone
two day fm's facebook page for instance contained a number of angry comments after news of the nurse's death broke
this death is on your conscience reads one post
another says blood on your hands
a person using the name riz wrote this pair have undone all the good work australia have done in the last century
the australian people should be outraged at the pair of them
they've brought disgrace on your country and the whole world knows it

celebrity publicist max clifford was arrested thursday by police investigating sex abuse allegations sparked by a scandal involving a now deceased tv host british media reports said
surrounded by media as he left belgravia police station later that night clifford said the claims against him are very damaging while insisting they are totally untrue
these allegations
are very distressing for myself my family and my kids said the publicist who didn't elaborate on the accusations except to say they dated from one thousand nine hundred and seventy seven
opinion
bbc in crisis what have we learned 
anyone who really knew me those years ago and those who have known me since will have no doubt that i would never act in the way i have today been accused
his lawyer earlier confirmed that clifford who is famous in britain for representing celebrities and members of the public willing to sell kiss and tell stories was questioned by police but did not say what it regarded
max clifford is being interviewed by police
mr. clifford will assist the police as best he can with their inquiries said lawyer charlotte harris from the mishcon de reya law firm
london's metropolitan police said a man in his sixty s was arrested on suspicion of sexual offenses thursday morning in surrey outside london in connection with the inquiry involving late television personality jimmy savile
those arrested under british law can be held in a cell and questioned after which they may be released or charged with a crime
but the force declined to name the suspect in line with policy
the police set up operation yewtree to investigate a flood of sex abuse allegations made against savile and others following a documentary run by broadcaster itv in october in which several victims came forward

jimmy savile
national treasure in life reviled sex abuser in death
the investigation has three strands one involving claims against just savile another involving savile and others and the third involving only others
a police statement said thursday's arrest fell under the category of others
police believe savile who died last october at age eighty four sexually abused as many as three hundred young women and girls in past decades
savile who hosted popular bbc children's tv programs including jim'll fix it and top of the pops was a household name in britain for decades
he was also well known for his philanthropy having raised millions of pounds for charity and was awarded a knighthood
savile's targets were apparently mostly girls in their mid teens in what authorities have described as alleged abuse on an unprecedented scale some of it conducted on bbc premises

as protesters battled supporters of egyptian president mohamed morsy outside his palace his chief of staff announced thursday that the president would address the nation later in the day
the chief of staff refaa el tahtawy said the speech would include important news but did not specify what that might be
the announcement came hours after demonstrations erupted into violence wednesday night over morsy's assumption of sweeping powers last month
three of morsy's advisers resigned wednesday in protest of his edict while demonstrators set fire to offices of the muslim brotherhood and its political arm the freedom and justice party in three cities
the unrest comes as egypt lurches toward a scheduled december fifteen referendum on a new constitution
days of largely peaceful protests in tahrir square had preceded wednesday's violence
but that all changed wednesday
after morsy supporters chased protesters from the grounds pro and anti morsy demonstrators threw rocks fireworks and molotov cocktails at each other
late in the day a spokesman for the muslim brotherhood called on protesters to withdraw from the area of the palace and not to protest there again due to its significant symbolic position as the president's office
the health ministry reported four were killed and two hundred and seventy one were injured
state media reported earlier in the night that no one was killed
dr. mohamed sultan a spokesman for the ministry said the injuries ranged from bruises to cuts burns and fractures
more marches were promised for thursday said rami shath a member of the revolutionary alliance and the free egyptian party
we hold opposition figures namely sabbahi and elbaradei fully responsible for escalation of violence and inciting their supporters said the muslim brotherhood in a tweet referring to opposition leaders hamdeen sabbahi and mohamed elbaradei
morsy egypt's first freely elected leader was a muslim brotherhood leader before winning office in june when he resigned from the movement and the freedom and justice party to represent all egyptians he said
demonstrators were protesting his recent edict granting himself sweeping powers and the proposed constitution drafted by an islamist dominated council that they fear will give him even more power
this is not what we asked for one protester said
it's a complete dictatorship
other protesters vowed to remain in the streets until morsy is forced to leave office
he's not our president anymore another protester said
the three advisers who announced their resignations said they had done so after failing to persuade morsy to reverse his november twenty three decree
he has rejected all our suggestions and initiatives that may have avoided the cycle of violence we are witnessing today ayman al sayad seif abdel fattah and mohammed esmat said in a joint statement
but the powerful muslim brotherhood called the protesters thugs who were trying to overthrow the president
by the grace of god the egyptian people will be able to protect this legitimacy its constitution and its institutions the group said on its facebook page
ahmed sobea a spokesman of the freedom and justice party said the party's offices in the northeastern cities of suez and ismailia had been ransacked and torched by masked armed men on wednesday night
the offices were empty when the attacks occurred sobea said
state run nile tv broadcast pictures of the ismaila office on fire and reported that other masked men had burned the muslim brotherhood headquarters in the northeastern city of zagazig
opposition leaders are prepared to open talks with morsy if he withdraws his edict and delays the referendum said elbaradei leader of the liberal constitution party and a nobel peace prize laureate
but vice president mahmoud mekki said the referendum will be held as planned
saying the referendum will be held on time is not being stubborn mekki said
the president has backtracked from decisions before
he's not a stubborn character
morsy's decree placed his decisions out of the reach of courts until a new constitution is approved
he said the move was designed to protect the spirit of the popular two thousand and eleven uprising that drove former strongman hosni mubarak from power
egyptian judges and media outlets as well as liberal political groups have protested morsy's decree and the proposed constitution saying it goes against the goals of the revolution
how the struggle plays out could have repercussions across the middle east and north africa regions already wracked by upheaval
in nearby gaza and israel tensions remain high after last month's fighting
in syria a civil war has raged since march two thousand and eleven
wednesday's violence followed clashes tuesday outside the palace which has become the focus of protests by egypt's liberal opposition
on tuesday night police fired tear gas after anti morsy protesters broke through barbed wire around the palace and hurled chairs and rocks at retreating officers
after the initial clashes police withdrew behind fences and the demonstration was peaceful for several hours
yassir ali a spokesman for the presidential office and the vice president told reporters wednesday that the presidential office had ordered the security forces at the palace to protect the protesters and keep them safe
the orders to the security forces were not to confront to preserve the lives of the protesters and to prevent any clashes between the security forces and the protesters ali said

rupert murdoch protg rebekah brooks was charged tuesday with conspiracy over alleged illegal payments to a ministry of defence employee london's metropolitan police said tuesday
in a separate case andy coulson another former murdoch employee who went on to work for prime minister david cameron faces charges of conspiring to make illegal payments to officials for information relating to the royal family britain's crown prosecution service said

why media fights back so hard
brooks and coulson are former editors of the now defunct news of the world newspaper owned by a uk subsidiary of murdoch's news corp. news international
brooks also was editor of daily tabloid the sun from two thousand and three to two thousand and nine before becoming chief executive of news international
two others face charges of conspiracy to commit misconduct in public office alongside brooks the former chief reporter at the sun john kay and bettina jordan barber employed by the ministry of defence
a fourth suspect identified only as a second public official remains under investigation the cps said
the charges in this case relate to the period from january one two thousand and four to january thirty one of this year alison levitt chief legal adviser to the director of public prosecutions said in a statement
this conspiracy relates to information allegedly provided by bettina jordan barber for payment which formed the basis of a series of news stories published by the sun levitt said
it is alleged that approximately one hundred thousand was paid to bettina jordan barber between two thousand and four and two thousand and eleven
kay sixty nine and brooks forty four were formally charged at london police stations tuesday
both are scheduled to appear at westminster magistrates court on november twenty nine
the case in which coulson is charged also involves former news of the world royal correspondent clive goodman
both men face two counts of conspiring to commit misconduct in public office
the allegations relate to the request and authorization of payments to public officials in exchange for information including a palace phone directory known as the green book containing contact details for the royal family and members of the household levitt said
royal officials declined to comment on the charges
coulson who took over as editor of news of the world in two thousand and three having served as deputy editor for three years resigned from the post in two thousand and seven
he was then appointed director of communications for cameron but stepped down in early two thousand and eleven amid questions over allegations of phone hacking by the news of the world saying he did not want to be a distraction
the charges against coulson brooks and the other suspects result from a metropolitan police investigation into alleged illegal payments to public officials codenamed operation elveden
it was launched in conjunction with police inquiries into alleged phone and computer hacking
the news of the world was shuttered in summer two thousand and eleven amid public outrage over revelations that it hacked into the voicemail of a missing schoolgirl milly dowler who later turned out to have been murdered

the driver was not hurt and police say she is helping them with their inquiries
in a painful coincidence the head coach for the gb cycling team shane sutton was also injured in an accident while cycling in the manchester area thursday the sport's governing body british cycling said
he suffered bruising and bleeding on the brain the body said in a statement and is likely to remain hospitalized for the next few days while undergoing more tests
it is extremely rare that our riders and coaches are hurt while out cycling on the road even rarer that two incidents should occur in a short space of time and we wish shane and bradley a speedy recovery british cycling said
cycling is not an intrinsically dangerous activity but there is much more to be done to improve conditions for cyclists on the roads
safety is a big issue for cyclists in britain and elsewhere
according to the royal society for the prevention of accidents a road safety group one hundred and seven cyclists died on britain's roads last year
more than three thousand others were seriously injured and at least sixteen thousand were slightly injured
wiggins accident sparked a flurry of comments on twitter some sympathetic others highlighting the dangers cyclists face on the road or the risk they pose to other road users if they don't ride responsibly

police in rustenberg south africa clashed tuesday with more than one thousand striking miners who were barricading public roads near the anglo american platinum mine
police fired tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse the protesters and sporadic scuffles continue capt
dennis adrio with the north west police told cnn
police and firefighters responded after a power substation on anglo american platinum's property was set on fire at four a.m. adrio said
tuesday's clashes continued a wave of wildcat strikes and violent confrontations that has wracked the country's mining sector for more than two months the worst labor unrest since the end of apartheid
anglo american platinum fired about twelve thousand striking workers who refused to attend disciplinary hearings earlier this month after a three week walkout
another company gold fields limited fired eight thousand one hundred striking workers last week after they did not return to work
some fifteen thousand workers at the company's kdc east mine near johannesburg had gone on strike to seek higher pay as have workers at several other south africa mines
repeated clashes have occurred since police opened fire on strikers lonmin's marikana platinum mine in august killing thirty four workers and wounding dozens more


four nigerian farmers and the environmental group friends of the earth took oil giant shell to court thursday in the netherlands to demand a proper cleanup and compensation for pollution in the niger delta
the farmers want the anglo dutch multinational to clean up the oil pollution in their fields and fishponds and make sure their pipelines are maintained and kept secure to prevent leaks in the future
the civil case has been filed against the nigerian subsidiary of shell the shell petroleum development company and its international headquarters in the netherlands royal dutch shell

based on years of oil pollution in three villages in the niger delta it could have major legal consequences internationally the dutch branch of friends of the earth known locally as milieudefensie said in a statement ahead of the first hearing
the three villages concerned are goi hit by a spill in two thousand and four oruma affected by a spill a year later and ikot ada udo hit by various spills in two thousand and seven according to friends of the earth
shell argues that it has cleaned up the spills to the satisfaction of the nigerian authorities and has no case to answer
but friends of the earth says that oil pollution has had a devastating and continuing impact on vegetation water supplies and local fishing ponds
the campaign group says this is the first time a dutch company has been brought before a court in the netherlands over environmental damage caused abroad
it is also the first time that the headquarters of a multinational concern on the european continent has been summoned to appear in court for environmental or human rights violations in a developing country it said
shell insists it is committed to cleaning up all spills from its facilities and blames saboteurs who steal oil from its pipelines for much of the environmental damage

could it finally be springtime for nigeria 
the real tragedy of the niger delta is the widespread and continual criminal activity including sabotage theft and illegal refining that causes the vast majority of oil spills shell spokesman jonathan french said in a statement thursday
it is this criminality which all organizations with an interest in nigeria's future should focus their efforts on highlighting and addressing
french said that shell had cleaned up three leaks at three locations from two thousand and four to two thousand and seven which were caused by sabotage
under nigerian law oil companies are not liable to pay compensation for damage caused by sabotage spills he said
the court is expected to hear from both sides in the case thursday and will probably deliver a verdict late this year or early in two thousand and thirteen friends of the earth said
hopefully the legal route that milieudefensie has chosen will ensure not only that four people in the niger delta have a better life but also increase the opportunity for thousands of their fellow citizens and millions of people worldwide who now often are without rights against powerful and sometimes unscrupulous multinationals campaign coordinator geert ritsema said
the argument over the impact of oil production in the niger delta which includes the ogoniland region is a long running one
the world's third largest wetland the niger delta is diverse and rich with mangroves and fish rich waterways
but oil drilling has turned it into one of the most oil polluted places on earth with more than six thousand eight hundred recorded oil spills accounting for anywhere from nine million to thirteen million barrels of oil spilled according to activist groups
many residents make their livelihoods from fishing and depend on the polluted mangroves and creeks
a report by the u.n. environmental program last year found that pollution from more than fifty years of oil operations in the ogoniland region by shell and other companies was more far reaching than thought
the assessment commissioned by the nigerian government and funded by shell concluded that restoration of the area could take up to thirty years cost one billion dollar and become the largest cleanup operation in history
control and maintenance of oilfield infrastructure in ogoniland has been and remains inadequate
the shell petroleum development company's own procedures have not been applied creating public health and safety issues the report found
shell has previously accepted responsibility for two oil spills in ogoniland in two thousand and eight and two thousand and nine

investigators have identified two of the four people killed in a mysterious attack in the foothills of the french alps this week as the parents of two young girls found alive at the scene a prosecutor said friday
they also said a witness reported seeing a green four x four vehicle and a motorbike near the site of the killings in a mountainous and wealthy area of eastern france
but investigators seemed no nearer to giving any answers as to who might have carried out wednesday's brutal attack which has captured headlines in british and french media or why
british nationals saad al hilli and his wife were among three people whose bodies were found in a car shot to death in a secluded parking lot french prosecutor eric maillaud said
police in surrey the english county where the family lived identified the wife as ikbal
the couple's identities were confirmed to investigators by al hilli's four year old daughter who spent hours in the vehicle hiding behind her dead mother's legs apparently immobilized by fear maillaud said
the girl identified as zeena has not been able to give investigators any more information about who carried out the attack he said
her seven year old sister was found severely injured with a fractured skull and bullet wound to her shoulder outside the car
she is still in a medically induced coma and can not yet be spoken to maillaud said
he described her survival as a miracle
we hope that she will be able to tell us what she went through provide us with descriptions of the murderer of murderers maillaud said of investigators hopes for when she gets out of the coma and can be interviewed
the identity of a third person who was killed in the car is not yet clear
she was an older woman with a swedish passport but her relationship to the others has not been confirmed maillaud said
the fourth victim french cyclist sylvain mollier was named thursday
he was found with a gunshot to the head in the same parking lot off a forested road near the village of chevaline in the haute savoie area
maillaud said that it seemed likely that mollier a local man who had a young child was in the wrong place at the wrong time but that it was too early to say for certain that he was not the intended target
a british cyclist came upon the older girl wednesday near picturesque lake annecy and spotted the bodies inside the car before alerting authorities
the younger girl wasn't found until nearly eight hours later under her mother's legs and surrounded by bags
the witness told police he saw a green four x four vehicle and a motorbike heading away the prosecutor said before adding that such vehicles are not unusual in the area
a former serviceman the cyclist did not hear anything but pointed out to police that he was carrying out strenuous exercise at the time maillaud said
maillaud has opened a judicial investigation for murder and attempted murder in the case joelle robert of the annecy prosecutor's office told cnn
autopsies on the four bodies are being carried out with the results expected late friday the french prosecutor said
he confirmed that all four killed had been shot at least three times including in the head
still pending ballistic reports may indicate the type and number of weapons used
maillaud said twenty five spent cartridges have been found
the grisly case has sparked wide speculation about motives for the killings from a family feud to a drug deal gone wrong
but maillaud sought to dampen rumors about a family conflict saying al hilli's brother had gone to police voluntarily thursday after learning from the media that his relatives had been shot to find out what happened
he went back to police friday to say there had been no conflict with his dead brother over money as had been reported maillaud said
by saturday four french investigators will be in the united kingdom working on the case in collaboration with their british counterparts he said
surrey police officers have been stationed outside the claygate house identified by neighbors as that of al hilli
in a news release issued friday night surrey police said force members are facilitating a visit by french investigators
this is a complex and ongoing investigation being led by french authorities and surrey police is providing any assistance possible police said
french authorities hope to return the four year old girl to family members in britain soon once they assess to whom she can be entrusted the prosecutor said
although physically unharmed she is being cared for by specialist pediatric medical personnel under the watchful eye of police and british consular officials
her seven year old sister who has been named in media reports as zainab is also being protected by police in case of a further threat to her safety
what is known about the victims is that saad al hilli was an iraqi born engineer who lived in claygate in surrey south of london with his wife and two daughters
he was born in one thousand nine hundred and sixty two and was a naturalized british citizen
he was completely unknown to french and british counterterrorism and intelligence services at the time of his death maillaud said
neighbor jack saltman whose home backs onto the family's garden said al hilli and his wife had come from iraq many years ago and both spoke perfect english
they were a delightful family saltman said
the neighbor said al hilli's wife ikbal was a dentist and the two daughters were absolutely beautiful
an accountant for saad al hilli julian stedman said the engineer had at least one business registered locally
british prime minister david cameron said he and french president francois hollande discussed the terrible killings of
the british family during a meeting thursday in london
he promised that british authorities will cooperate very closely with the french authorities to help those poor children and get to the bottom of what happened in this clearly very tragic and awful case
both a french and a british family have been impacted by this terrible event and we will do our utmost to identify the perpetrators said hollande in a joint news conference after the two leaders met

anders behring breivik the man who killed seventy seven people in a bomb attack and gun rampage just over a year ago was judged to be sane by a norwegian court friday as he was sentenced to twenty one years in prison
breivik was charged with voluntary homicide and committing acts of terror in the attacks in oslo and on utoya island on july twenty two two thousand and eleven
the issue of breivik's sanity on which mental health experts have given conflicting opinions was central to the court's ruling
breivik who boasts of being an ultranationalist who killed his victims to fight multiculturalism in norway wanted to be ruled sane so that his actions wouldn't be dismissed as those of a lunatic
he says he acted out of necessity to prevent the islamization of his country
but prosecutors had asked that breivik thirty three be acquitted on the grounds of insanity in which case he would have been held in a secure mental health unit
the unanimous verdict was delivered at oslo district court by a panel of five judges
breivik dressed in a dark suit and tie had a slight smile on his face as the decision was given
he was sentenced to the maximum possible term of twenty one years and was ordered to serve a minimum of ten years in prison
the sentence could be extended potentially indefinitely in the future if he is considered still to pose a threat to society
norway does not have the death penalty
breivik has said he won't appeal the verdict
the chief prosecutor also confirmed friday that the prosecution does not intend to lodge an appeal
bjorn ihler a survivor of the utoya island attack told cnn he was glad the trial had concluded and that justice had been done
it's been an amazingly difficult process
it's been a constant constant reminder of why we have to fight extremism in every way possible he said of the trial
we have to make sure nothing like this ever happens again
the court's judgment that breivik is sane means that the far right views he espouses can be confronted in norway without being dismissed as those of a madman ihler said
there are extremist people around they are not insane and we have to be able to take a proper debate with them he said
asked whether the verdict meant closure for him ihler said
this case is going to live strongly with me for the rest of my life probably
send us your reaction to the verdict
reading out the court's ruling judge wenche elizabeth arntzen spoke of breivik's manifesto a document published online in which he set out his ultranationalist political views
breivik claimed to belong to a far right group called the knights templar but the court found no evidence of its existence the judge said
he described his actions as a pre emptive attack in defense of ethnic norwegian people and culture the court heard
breivik trained for his attack by working out in the gym running with a backpack filled with rocks and practicing at a shooting club the court heard
he was under the influence of ephedrine a stimulant at the time of the attacks and the possibility that this contributed to his behavior can not be ruled out judge arne lyng said
he used meditation techniques to cut off his emotions lyng said
in the course of the ten week trial which wrapped up in june the court heard chilling evidence from some of those who survived breivik's shooting spree on utoya island in which sixty nine people died most of them teenagers attending a labour party summer youth camp
in his own testimony given without emotion breivik recounted firing more bullets into teenagers who were injured and couldn't escape killing those who tried to play dead and driving others into the sea to drown
his fertilizer bomb attack against government buildings in oslo also killed eight people and injured many more
it was only luck that more people were not killed and hurt in the blast the court heard
breivik blames politicians and the labour party in particular for promoting multiculturalism in norway
he has been held in a particularly high security wing of ila prison since his detention immediately after the killings
the prison's governor knut bjarkeid said wednesday that the institution was ready to hold breivik securely whether the court ruled him sane or not
our job is to protect the community bjarkeid said
over the past year breivik has had three cells for his use one for physical exercise and another for reading and writing as well as a separate outdoor exercise space he said
breivik can not mix with prisoners from other wings but does have contact with prison staff
as of now we think there is a need to subject mr. behring breivik to a particularly high security regime bjarkeid said
the high security regime puts a heavy strain on an inmate especially if it lasts for a longer period he added so breivik's continued detention under these conditions will be kept under constant review
defense lawyer geir lippestad has previously said it is important to breivik that people see him as sane so they don't dismiss his views
the court had to consider conflicting opinions from medical experts in reaching its verdict
an initial team of psychiatrists found breivik to be paranoid and schizophrenic following thirty six hours of interviews
however a second pair of experts found he was not psychotic at the time of the attacks does not suffer from a psychiatric condition and is not mentally challenged
their report said there is a high risk for repeated violent actions
mark stephens a partner at law firm finers stephens innocent told cnn friday
the general public will think only a madman can commit these offenses but in law madness is defined very narrowly
basically it requires a doctor to come to court and say this person has a definable medical illness in this case the prosecution said he was a paranoid schizophrenic and that can be treated with drugs and behavioral therapy
if however he had a personality disorder or was just
motivated as in this case by a misguided political belief that this was the only way to stop the islamization as he would have it of his nation then in those circumstances he has be found guilty because he understood what he was doing was wrong
disturbing look into mind of norway shooter
breivik's rampage the worst atrocity on norwegian soil since world war ii prompted much soul searching
norwegians reasserted their commitment to multiculturalism and tolerance at a series of mass public tributes held in the immediate aftermath of the massacre
and earlier this month norway's chief of police stepped down after an independent commission detailed a catalog of police and intelligence failures
it concluded that those errors cost police thirty minutes in getting to utoya and that dozens of lives might have been saved
speaking last month on the anniversary of the killings prime minister jens stoltenberg urged norwegians to honor the dead by celebrating life and said breivik had failed in his attempt to change norway's values

a former rupert murdoch newspaper editor who became a spokesman for british prime minister david cameron told a probe into british press ethics that he did not know about phone hacking while he was editor
andy coulson was quizzed thursday over the news of the world's relationships with politicians as well as his role as cameron's communications chief in two and a half hours of questioning before the independent government appointed panel
the leveson inquiry was set up in response to accusations of widespread phone hacking by journalists working for the news of the world which was edited by coulson from two thousand and three until his resignation in two thousand and seven
critics have questioned cameron's judgment in hiring coulson after he quit the paper
coulson resigned as cameron's spokesman in january two thousand and eleven when police opened a new investigation into the scandal
he insisted he was innocent but said he had become a distraction for the government
questioned thursday coulson said the jailing of two news of the world employees over phone hacking in two thousand and seven did come up in discussions with senior party members before he was offered the job
he told the inquiry he had told them and cameron what he has said repeatedly that he knew nothing about the practice of hacking under his leadership of the paper
he also denied he was taken on because of his links to news international the british arm of news corp. which runs the uk's biggest selling daily tabloid the sun
coulson said he had told cameron and then shadow chancellor george osborne that his connections would not guarantee the backing of murdoch's papers and that they should reach out to a wide range of news outlets
the sun switched its allegiance from the labour party to cameron's conservatives ahead of the two thousand and ten election which resulted in the formation of a conservative liberal democrat coalition government
coulson said he never witnessed a conversation that was inappropriate between members of the government and news international
he also denied direct involvement in discussions of news corp.'s bid fully to take over british satellite broadcaster bskyb and dismissed as a conspiracy theory the suggestion that some kind of deal had been struck by the conservatives on that takeover in return for murdoch's support
asked later however whether politicians and the press were too close coulson said he was not minded to disagree with the assessment of cameron that relations were too cozy
coulson said he had continued to hold forty thousand of shares in news corp. while working for cameron in opposition and in government but had not considered it a conflict of interest
he had not paid much attention to his financial affairs he said because his job kept him very busy
quizzed about his relationship with murdoch chairman of news corp. coulson said the media baron would often call on a saturday night shortly before the newspaper's publication sunday
we discussed politics generally
he would give me his views on whatever was in the news at the time coulson said
coulson said murdoch was supportive of him as an editor
i was an employee and i thoroughly enjoyed my time working for him
in the interactions i had with him he was warm and supportive coulson said
i wasn't particularly close to him i wouldn't want to overstate it
coulson said the newspaper tended to reflect the public mood on politics rather than try to lead it except on certain issues
the decision to support labour prime minister tony blair in the two thousand and five election was taken with the news of the world's editorial team he said
however he did not recall discussing the paper's support for the labour party with murdoch
i was determined we would spend a reasonable amount of time with politicians from both parties and make up our own minds coulson said
the paper's coverage of the conservative party leadership contest which resulted in cameron becoming party leader was not skewed in favor of any of the candidates coulson said
asked if the news of world's coverage of the conservative party grew more favorable after cameron became leader coulson pointed out that the paper had run stories that did not help the party
he resigned as editor when one of the paper's journalists and a private investigator were sent to prison for phone hacking in two thousand and seven although he denied knowing about the illegal eavesdropping
six months later he was hired to work for cameron as his director of communications
coulson said the progression from the media world to politics was not unusual
questions have been raised in the uk media about the level of security vetting coulson underwent
he told the inquiry he had seen some classified documents and occasionally attended security briefings
the phone hacking scandal has reverberated throughout the top levels of british politics and journalism and led a parliamentary committee to issue damning criticism of global media baron murdoch
dozens of people including coulson have been arrested in connection with the scandal although no one has been charged
he is free on bail
another former news of the world editor rebekah brooks is set to appear before the inquiry friday
brooks resigned last summer as chief executive of news of the world's publisher news international a subsidiary of news corp. amid outrage over claims of widespread hacking by the sunday tabloid's staff
she was editor of news of the world in two thousand and two when the newspaper hacked the voice mail of a missing schoolgirl milly dowler
the teenager was later found dead
brooks has been arrested twice and released on bail in connection with police investigations into the scandal
coulson acknowledged that cameron was particularly interested in gaining the backing of the sun the biggest selling daily tabloid and another of murdoch's uk newspapers
but he denied having encouraged cameron to become friends with brooks who was the sun's editor from two thousand and three to two thousand and nine
coulson said there was a long standing family connection between cameron and her husband racehorse trainer charlie brooks and the couple lived near the conservative lawmaker's constituency home
rebekah and charlie brooks have socialized with cameron
rebekah brooks is also known for close ties to murdoch
last month the leveson inquiry grilled the media magnate and his son james murdoch also a senior news corp. executive
rupert murdoch faced stinging criticism last week when a uk parliamentary committee examining phone hacking at the news of the world said he was not a fit person to run a major international company
however news corp.'s board of directors strongly endorsed him wednesday expressing full confidence in rupert murdoch's fitness and supporting his leadership of the company
murdoch's news corp. encompasses fox news the wall street journal the new york post and harper collins publishers in the united states
news international a british subsidiary of news corp. owns the sun the times and the sunday times in britain

media magnate rupert murdoch traveled to london friday as he seeks to rein in a crisis over alleged misconduct at the embattled sun newspaper part of his huge news corp. empire
murdoch's visit follows the saturday arrests of five sun journalists as part of an inquiry into alleged illegal payments to british police and officials
in what appeared to be a bid to boost morale murdoch told staffers at the sun britain's best selling newspaper that the company will launch a sunday edition of the paper
staff at the paper have reacted angrily to the arrests and internal investigations of their journalistic practices which they have likened to a witch hunt
the launch of a sun on sunday newspaper to replace the news of the world a sister paper to the sun that was shuttered amid a phone hacking scandal in the summer had been widely rumored
however this is the first time news corp.'s uk subsidiary news international has confirmed the move
in an e mail to staff at the sun murdoch said the company would build on the sun's proud heritage by launching the sun on sunday very soon
he also said he had great respect for the exceptional journalism produced by the sun but that it must abide by the law
my continuing respect makes this situation a source of great pain for me as i know it is for each of you he wrote
we will obey the law
illegal activities simply can not and will not be tolerated at any of our publications
in a sign of support for the arrested journalists none of whom have been charged murdoch said all suspensions had been lifted and that they could return to work
news corp. will cover their legal expenses he said adding
everyone is innocent until proven guilty
but he made clear that the newspaper could not protect anyone who had paid public officials
the arrests are part of operation elveden an investigation running in parallel with a police inquiry into alleged phone hacking by the media london's metropolitan police said
the five journalists aged forty five to sixty eight were arrested at their homes in london kent and essex on suspicion of corruption aiding and abetting misconduct in a public office and conspiracy in relation to both offenses police said
their arrests followed those of four current and former sun employees two weeks earlier in connection with the same investigation
allegations of payoffs to public officials by sun employees threaten to bring the uk crisis across the atlantic to the united states where the foreign corrupt practices act prevents companies from paying bribes overseas
at the moment it appears he is ready to sacrifice the journalists and journalism in london to do whatever it takes to be seen to be cleaning up his act there so that it will play better in the united states andrew neil a former editor of murdoch paper the times told cnn thursday
the consequence of that is quite amazing the sun which is the most loyal newspaper murdoch has ever owned now believes it is being hung out to dry and the sun journalists are turning against them
murdoch's uk interests only represent a one point six billion dollar slice of his thirty two billion dollar news corp. empire which includes movie studio twenty th century fox the fox broadcasting co. and harper collins publishers as well as the wall street journal and dow jones newswires
this is for rupert murdoch no longer about journalism
this is about defending news corp. his american based parent company from judicial action and investigation in the united states neil said
such actions could put broadcast operations the most profitable part of the news corp. operations in jeopardy said porter bibb of mediatech capital partners in new york
if it can be proven that anybody working for news corp. bribed or gave money to an official of a foreign government i.e
the uk that's a clear violation and the justice department will start the wheels in motion and i think that's what rupert murdoch has been gearing up for in the past few months bibb said
following the arrests murdoch chairman and ceo of news corp assured an executive he would continue to own and publish the sun newspaper according to an internal staff memo sent by news international chief executive tom mockridge
mockridge also said he was very saddened by the arrests of deputy editor geoff webster picture editor john edwards chief reporter john kay chief foreign correspondent nick parker and john sturgis who is a news editor
analysis
murdoch empire and journalism on the line
news corp. said in a statement last saturday that it remains committed to ensuring that unacceptable news gathering practices by individuals in the past will not be repeated
news corp.'s management and standards committee set up in the wake of the scandal that engulfed the news of the world tabloid provided the information to police that led to the arrests
the move prompted fury among many reporters at the paper
trevor kavanagh associate editor of the sun wrote a column monday in which he said the paper's journalists were being subjected to a witch hunt
the sun is not a swamp that needs draining
nor are those other great news international titles the times and the sunday times he wrote
yet in what would at any other time cause uproar in parliament and among civil liberty and human rights campaigners its journalists are being treated like members of an organized crime gang
he said it was right police inquiries are carried out separately from the journalists under investigation
but he added
it is also important our parent company news corp protects its reputation in the united states and the interests of its shareholders
but some of the greatest legends in fleet street have been held at least on the basis of evidence so far revealed for simply doing their jobs as journalists on behalf of the company
murdoch may be hoping his visit to london will lessen the anger felt by staff at the sun britain's best selling newspaper
editor dominic mohan has said the paper has a readership of more than seven point seven million
the arrests of the sun employees comes after murdoch owned newspaper news of the world was alleged to have hacked into private voice mails of a wide range of public officials celebrities and victims of crime
the phone hacking scandal prompted murdoch's son news corp. executive james murdoch to shut down news of the world in july
the best selling british newspaper was one hundred and sixty eight years old
so far news corp. and its subsidiary companies have paid more than two hundred million dollar in legal fees and settlement of fifty nine of sixty lawsuits filed over phone hacking claims
james murdoch is facing new e mail evidence that would have made him aware of widespread phone hacking at the newspaper
the younger murdoch has appeared twice before uk
lawmakers and said he had no knowledge of the practice

more deaths were reported in eastern europe on thursday as the region continued to shiver in the grip of unusually frigid weather
the coldest temperatures continued to chill the eastern european countries of romania ukraine belarus and russia where thursday was the coldest day yet for many
in ukraine sixty five people have died since the bad weather started this week according to the ukranian emergency ministry
of those forty seven were homeless
others died in their homes or in hospitals as a result of frostbite and hypothermia
health officials say that more than one thousand one hundred people have sought help for hypothermia and frostbite over the past six days the state run ukrinform news agency reported and more than nine hundred of them have been treated in hospitals
the authorities have opened more than two thousand two hundred heated tents for people who do not have heating in their homes
most schools in the capital kiev are closed through the weekend
temperatures there dipped to twenty five point five degrees below zero celsius thursday the coldest night in eighty three years according to ukrinform
conditions in eastern ukraine are among the toughest because high winds are common there and it is a poor area
many homes still have a soviet era heating system which is prone to break down
temperatures are expected to drop as low as thirty five degrees below zero celsius overnight thursday to friday in parts of the country
cnn international meteorologist jennifer delgado said eastern and central europe are being hammered by a ridge of high pressure that is pulling in cold siberian air
the trend will continue friday she said
in poland twenty nine people have died as a result of the freeze the publicly funded polish radio's news website reported up from only half that number a day earlier
temperatures plummeted to thirty four degrees below zero celsius in the bieszczady mountains in southeastern poland overnight the website said
the country's southern eastern and central provinces are most affected by the cold with temperatures expected to fall even lower overnight into friday
some schools are closed because their heating is inadequate to cope with the conditions
katarzyna najorczyk vice principal of a high school in bydgoszcz said kids safety and health is the most important
police are continuing to search for homeless people to take them to shelters
in szczecin arkadiusz oryszewski of the phenix association said during the last days of cold weather our team had to go out to bring new people every two hours
only tonight seven people were brought and this morning we have three men so far
six people have died from the cold in serbia and one is missing and presumed dead the serbian state run news agency tanjug quoted emergencies official predrag maric of the country's interior ministry as saying

some city administrations sent workers home
temperatures in the capital ankara dipped to nineteen degrees below zero celsius and snow continued to fall there as well as in istanbul
farther west much of central and northern italy has been blanketed by unusually heavy snowfall
air and road travel has been disrupted and many professional soccer games have been canceled because of the bad weather
cnn ireporter luca martini said heavy snow had fallen in the northern italian city of ferrara
the twelve centimeter snowfall is quite unusual for the area he said and is causing traffic problems
miller said a strong high pressure area named dieter by the free university of berlin which has responsibility for naming highs and lows in europe is currently bringing down the frigid siberian air and keeping europe in the teeth of its worst cold spell in years
the heart of the cold air is now migrating slightly to the north he said and the most extreme temperatures will probably be found in the baltic states and eastern scandinavia as the week goes on
an area of low pressure moving in from the mediterranean will help the temperatures rebound somewhat in eastern and southeastern europe miller said but the system will bring heavy snow and storms which will make travel even more treacherous

singer amy winehouse's death this summer was the result of alcohol poisoning an inquest ruled wednesday as it reached a verdict of death by misadventure
a pathologist told a coroner's court in north london that alcohol toxicity was the cause of the twenty seven year old's death with her blood alcohol levels measured at more than five times the legal limit for driving
the grammy award winning artist who had battled with alcohol and drug abuse over several years was found dead at her north london home july twenty three
testimony at her inquest showed no traces of illegal drugs in winehouse's system but more details emerged about her losing battle with alcohol
winehouse's physician dr. christina romete said she saw winehouse at seven p.m. the day before she died when the singer was tipsy but still able to hold a conversation
asked when she was going to stop drinking winehouse replied that she would call romete over the weekend to discuss it the physician said
winehouse was determined to do things her own way including therapy romete said but was aware of the risks of alcohol abuse
the singer's personal security guard andrew morris said he last spoke to her at two a.m. on july twenty three
he said he looked in on her at ten a.m. and saw her lying on her bed but figured she was sleeping in which wasn't unusual the court heard
morris said he realized something was wrong when he checked in again at three p.m. and saw winehouse had not moved
she wasn't breathing and had no pulse he said
morris said the singer didn't drink to get drunk but that he noticed she had started drinking alcohol again that week
police who searched the flat after her death found three empty vodka bottles the inquest heard
the pathologist's tests revealed that winehouse's blood alcohol level was four hundred and sixteen milligrams per one hundred milliliters of blood
the level considered lethal is three hundred and fifty milligrams per one hundred milliliters of blood and the legal limit to drive in britain is eighty milligrams of alcohol
the pathologist found no traces of tablets in winehouse's stomach and said her organs appeared to be normal
the verdict of misadventure means that it is judged to be an accidental death in which no law was broken or criminal negligence involved
a family statement given by spokesman chris goodman said
it is some relief we finally found out what happened to amy
we understand there was alcohol in her system when she passed away
it is likely a buildup of alcohol in her system over a number of days
the court heard that amy was battling hard to conquer her problems with alcohol and it is a source of great pain that she could not win in time
she had started drinking again that week after a period of abstinence goodman said
winehouse's father mitch and mother janet were among those who packed the small courtroom at st. pancras coroners court to hear the evidence from key witnesses
her family set up the amy winehouse foundation last month to raise money to help young people in britain and elsewhere especially those suffering the effects of ill health disability poverty and addiction
goodman said the ruling underlines how important our work with the amy winehouse foundation is to us to help as many young people and children we can in her name
winehouse's family said in august that toxicology tests had found that no illegal substances were in her system at the time of her death but alcohol was present
the singer's soulful throaty vocals brought her stardom in two thousand and seven but her troubled off stage life chronicled in her top ten hit rehab won her notoriety
her death came less than two months after her latest release from a rehabilitation program and weeks after she was booed offstage by disappointed fans in serbia
the tattooed london born singer songwriter's first album frank debuted in two thousand and three when she was nineteen
international success came with her two thousand and seven album back to black
she dominated the two thousand and eight grammys winning five awards that night and delivering via satellite from london a strong performance of rehab
mitch winehouse has said he plans to write a memoir called amy
my daughter to be released next summer which he said would tell the story of the amy that the public never got to know

london graciela watson watched aghast from her home in hackney monday as yobs barricaded her normally quiet residential street with burning trash cans and clashed repeatedly with police
she had witnessed tension building as she made her way home in the afternoon having to take a different route than usual with her two children both under three to avoid crowds of people throwing missiles
we didn't think it would come up our street but it started here she said
troublemaking youths or yobs gathered trash bins from outside the houses on the street and set them alight to form flaming barricades she said
that's when we realized trouble was coming our way watson a filmmaker and former journalist said
the youths then set fire to a van and soon the clashes with police began in earnest carrying on in her street for well over an hour
meanwhile asleep at the back of the ground floor apartment were watson's two young children and there was no way for the family to leave the apartment except by the front door
it was kind of strange watson said
you are scared but there's also a very strange kind of adrenaline almost as you watch everything unfold in front of you
watching on the tv hearing your street being named seeing your neighborhood in flames around you you are terrified but almost excited at the same time
the disturbances were centered on the neighboring pembury estate a social housing project in the east london area of hackney
police reported two hundred and fifty three hundred people gathered there monday night setting cars on fire and throwing petrol bombs while on nearby mare street businesses were looted
watson watched as young men tore bricks from the front wall of her yard and hurled them and planks of wood at police
it seemed like a war zone she said
there were yobs pushing police back and police pushing yobs back
once the police had managed to drive their assailants away what seemed to be younger looters many of them teenagers continued to run through the street clutching bags of goods stolen from local shops until twelve thirty or one a.m. she said
they were taking whatever they could and running around with it she said
there was an atmosphere almost of carnival from the yobs
they were enjoying it laughing it was as if they were having a really good time
she saw some of the youths urinating in doorways as they rampaged past with looted goods
it was absolute lawlessness they had completely lost control of themselves they were like animals
at about five a.m. local authority workers came to clear up the debris and sweep away the shattered glass leaving few traces of the night's rampage apart from three smashed up cars watson said
she is hoping it was just one night of madness and that hackney will remain calm tuesday night
if it happens again tonight i will seriously consider taking my family and leaving the house she said
i just don't think we can subject ourselves to that
and she fears other families may not now feel safe in hackney which has seen a previously troubled image largely rehabilitated in recent years
as in other east london areas its residents had hoped to see a beneficial spillover effect as a result of investment in infrastructure ahead of the london olympics next year
but as reports of rioting elsewhere emerged during the weekend she and her neighbors had shared a sense of foreboding that they would not escape the trouble and it proved all too correct
hackney was almost waiting for an excuse for something like this she said
i'm thinking about leaving the area full stop

police in birmingham england received a credible anonymous threat against officers monday and took steps last night to ensure the safety of our officers and staff the west midlands police force said tuesday
it was anonymous but credible information suggesting police officers could be subjected to attacks west midlands police assistant chief constable garry forsyth said
we acted swiftly to relay details to officers and remind them over the importance to remain vigilant
the force would not comment on bbc reports that the threat was to kidnap and kill a police officer
forsyth said that some staff were held on duty at the end of their shifts while they were given additional security guidance but that at no time were officers pulled off the streets
the guidance given included advice about traveling to and from work in uniform he said as well as on the security of police stations
our commitment is to protect the public from harm and though we take all security issues seriously we will not be distracted from that promise he said

afghan security forces stormed a bank branch besieged by insurgents in helmand province wednesday ending a deadly attack police said
five civilians one police officer and two army soldiers were killed said farid ahmad obaid a spokesman for the police chief of southern helmand province
fourteen others nine civilians among them were wounded obaid said
he warned that the death toll could go up since at least one of those injured was in critical condition
the taliban claimed responsibility for the attack on the kabul bank office in the provincial capital of lashkar gah
taliban spokesman qari yousuf ahmadi said via twitter that the target was afghan security forces personnel who were visiting the bank to receive their monthly salary
all the attackers were killed in the operation to end the siege obaid said
the four armed insurgents attacked shortly before noon he said
the first attacker who was riding a motorbike blew himself up outside the bank branch while three others stormed inside the building he said
obaid said the gunbattle between the afghan security forces and the assailants lasted about ninety minutes before the militants were killed
meanwhile a suspected drone strike tuesday killed eleven taliban in afghanistan's eastern nangarhar province near the border with pakistan a local afghan government official told cnn on wednesday
among those killed in the strike in sherzad district were four pakistanis and two midlevel afghan taliban officials said malem mashuq the district chief
it's not clear if the strike was linked to tuesday's shocking attack by the pakistan taliban on an army run school in peshawar northwestern pakistan in which one hundred and forty five people were killed one hundred and thirty two of them children
analysts say the afghan and pakistan taliban groups are closely affiliated often sharing resources and jointly plotting attacks on either side of the porous border
however a spokesman for the afghan taliban condemned the peshawar attack tuesday because it involved the deliberate killing of innocent people women and children
separately two bomb explosions wednesday morning in nangarhar's capital city jalalabad targeted afghan police vehicles killing two afghan policemen and injuring five others said zia abdulzai a spokesman for the provincial governor
the continuing violence comes as afghan security forces prepare to take on greater responsibility for ensuring the country's security as international forces transition to a supporting role
who are the pakistan taliban 

two american soldiers and at least nineteen afghans were killed in a spate of attacks in afghanistan friday and saturday some of which were claimed by the taliban officials said
the violence began friday when a bomb explosion hit a convoy of nato led international security assistance force troops
two american soldiers were killed in that blast a u.s. defense official said saturday on condition of anonymity
isaf which also reported the attack but did not release the nationalities of the victims said the attack happened in eastern afghanistan
the taliban claimed responsibility
spokesman zabiullah mujahid tweeted that a u.s. convoy had been targeted in bagram district and claimed five americans were killed
on saturday morning twelve afghan civilians who were clearing mines in southern helmand province died in an attack according to omar zwak a spokesman for the provincial governor
the civilians were defusing devices planted by the taliban to target military tanks and vehicles in an area between shorabak and nad ali districts of southern helmand he said
afghan security forces who arrived at the scene of the attack killed three of the militants and arrested four others
the taliban claimed responsibility for the attack and said those killed were soldiers and not genuine mine clearers
unknown gunmen in kabul killed atiquallah raufi head of the afghan supreme court secretariat saturday morning said hashmat stanikzai spokesman for kabul's police chief
that afternoon a suicide bomber targeted a bus carrying afghan national army personnel in the guzargah area of kabul on saturday afternoon said sediq sediqqi a spokesman for the afghan interior ministry
six army personnel were killed and eighteen other people were injured including two women bystanders he said
the taliban spokesman mujahid claimed responsibility for the blast in an e mail
he said that from now on taliban attacks against foreign and afghan forces would be stepped up
in the past couple of months the taliban have targeted many afghan national army buses and other vehicles
two days ago a bus carrying army personnel to work was targeted by a suicide bomber
five servicemen were killed and twelve more were injured
after many attacks on army buses especially during the morning and evening rush hour periods kabul residents are worried
some have called on the afghan defense ministry to change the way it transports army personnel
hashmatullah who witnessed saturday's attack said
the defense ministry should stop using big buses to avoid being an easy target and its personnel should use different routes to commute to work
he said that this way the lives of both army personnel and civilians who are traveling on the same roads would be saved
the taliban issued a separate warning saturday via facebook to media critical of the group saying that from now on will not stay silent and tolerate their actions and by using every possible way attacks will be carried out against them so immorality is annihilated from its root in our country
the continuing violence comes as afghan forces prepare to take on greater responsibility for ensuring the country's security as international forces transition to a supporting role
at the end of december u.s. forces will end their combat role in afghanistan and instead focus on counterterrorism missions and training advising and assisting afghan troops
nonetheless nearly eleven thousand u.s. troops will remain in afghanistan in the beginning of two thousand and fifteen
american forces will drop to five thousand five hundred in two thousand and sixteen and by two thousand and seventeen the coalition will consolidate to kabul
hagel
more u.s. troops than planned will remain in afghanistan next year

new elections will probably be held on march seventeen the speaker of israel's parliament said wednesday a day after the prime minister sacked two senior members of his coalition cabinet for criticizing government policy
prime minister benjamin netanyahu also called for parliament to be dissolved a step that the knesset is now considering
lawmakers voted unanimously to dissolve parliament in a preliminary vote wednesday according to the official knesset website
a knesset committee will now prepare a bill for further votes by lawmakers early next week
speaker yuli edelstein said the party heads had agreed on march seventeen as the proposed election date
the upheaval was triggered when netanyahu ordered letters of dismissal for finance minister yair lapid and justice minister tzipi livni two members of his cabinet from rival parties according to a statement from his office tuesday
during the last few weeks and in particular the last few days the ministers have intensely attacked the government that i am leading netanyahu said

i will not tolerate ministers attacking the government's policy and its head from inside the government
the call for new elections means israel is effectively in a state of political paralysis until march
israel held its last election just twenty two months ago
a poll for israel's channel two suggested that fifty five percents of those surveyed were against another election being held so soon
netanyahu will hope that the vote enables him to form a government he can work with including right wing and religious parties but there is no guarantee that he will be able to form the coalition he wants
netanyahu has been prime minister since two thousand and nine
but he's had to rely on members of other parties many of them to the left of likud on the political spectrum such as the centrist parties of livni and lapid to govern
netanyahu is also calculating that he can win a fourth term in office
opinion polls give a mixed picture indicating that many people blame him for the current crisis but that at the same time if elections were held today his right wing likud party would increase its share of seats in the one hundred and twenty seat knesset
however people feel there is a range of problems that are not being dealt with such as a faltering economy recent attacks against israelis in jerusalem and this summer's inconclusive war against hamas militants in gaza
netanyahu told reporters tuesday that a divided government was one of israel's problems saying there was a lot of debate contradictions and ultimatums
he called out livni for meeting with palestinian authority president mahmoud abbas against his advice and for criticizing building in jerusalem which some say has exacerbated tensions with arabs there
and netanyahu lambasted lapid for calling israel's boycott of iranian president hassan rouhani's u.n. speech a mistake and challenging his push to label israel a jewish state which some fear will alienate the country's significant arab population
he also accused the ministers of being behind talks to kick out the prime minister
in one word they call this a putsch netanyahu said
you can not have a government like this
it's impossible to govern like this
in a facebook post tuesday livni said the question in the election will not be who was the first to identify the threats and use them for political means but who will deal with the threats in a responsible level headed manner for the good of the country
lapid's centrist yesh atid party also fired back in a statement in which it said lapid told netanyahu by phone that he expected the prime minister to act responsibly and to stop dragging the and our soldiers into an election for your political needs
yesh atid said that unnecessary elections
will harm the economy and israeli society all for narrow political interests and a surrender to the ultra orthodox parties the powerful central committee of the likud and outside lobby groups

a spanish judge on tuesday temporarily banned cell phone based taxi service uber from operating in spain after a complaint brought by taxi drivers in the capital madrid
the judge issued the ban the equivalent of a temporary injunction on the grounds that uber was deemed to be causing damage to the taxi industry a court spokesman said
the hearing was in response to a complaint by the madrid taxi association which argued that uber is unfair competition and also lacks the proper municipal licenses to operate a taxi service
the madrid taxi association is expected now to file a formal lawsuit with the court after gathering more documents and information the court spokesman said
legal arguments for uber were not heard before the judge because the company is located outside of spain in the u.s. state of delaware and the taxi industry was seeking immediate relief he said
the company is expected to have a chance to argue its points before the judge when the formal lawsuit is filed
the madrid ruling comes on the same day that india's federal government warned states against allowing unlicensed web based taxi services after an uber driver was accused of raping a woman in new delhi
transport authorities in new delhi on monday announced a ban on uber services in the indian capital saying their investigation revealed the company was violating permit rules

more than one point seven million children in conflict torn areas of eastern ukraine face an extremely serious situation the u.n. children's agency has warned with their suffering exacerbated by harsh winter weather
many families have been forced from their homes and lack access to safe water sanitation and schooling
children continue to bear the brunt of this conflict with schooling disrupted and access to basic services limited said marie pierre poirier unicef regional director for central and eastern europe and central asia
she called for extra resources to be provided to those in need
extremely harsh winter conditions have made the impact of the crisis more acute she said
government forces and pro russia rebels have been battling for control of eastern donetsk and luhansk regions since april after russia annexed ukraine's southeastern crimea region the previous month
according to a unicef press release friday one hundred and forty seven schools have been closed in parts of the donetsk region where fighting is ongoing disrupting the education of about fifty thousand children since september one
while some schools are in ruins others are closed because of safety concerns
in government controlled areas one hundred and eighty seven educational institutions in total have been damaged or destroyed unicef said
the closures mean that besides lessons children are missing out on the stability and routine that can be provided by school at a time of crisis helping to alleviate their stress the agency said
it's not just those still living in conflict areas who are affected
since march more than one million people have been displaced by the fighting including nearly five hundred and thirty thousand within ukraine
of those at least one hundred and thirty thousand are children according to unicef
in many cases they are not attending a new school because their parents have not registered them anticipating further displacement or planning to return home
unicef says it needs thirty two point four million dollar to meet the urgent humanitarian needs of six hundred thousand children and their families in ukraine
the funds would help provide access to schooling
enable support to reduce children's high levels of stress
pay for polio vaccines
and ensure two hundred and fifty thousand children and women get safe water and hygiene supplies to prevent outbreaks of disease
the agency has received nine point four million dollar in funding and pledges to date
amid the fighting at least forty four children have been killed in ukraine this year according to the agency
while ukraine's civilian population suffers there is little sign of progress in reaching a diplomatic resolution to the crisis
western powers accuse russia of sending troops and equipment to help the separatists in their fight against ukrainian government forces and have imposed repeated rounds of economic sanctions against russian interests in a bid to put pressure on moscow
but president vladimir putin appears to have little appetite to repair relations with the west despite his country's tanking economy
putin told reporters gathered in moscow on thursday that his country was ready to mediate in the ukraine crisis
he also denied that russians killed in ukraine were members of his country's military repeating the long standing russian line that any russians fighting in ukraine were volunteers
a ceasefire deal was reached september five in minsk belarus after talks between representatives of ukraine's government russia and rebel leaders in eastern ukraine
a subsequent agreement on september nineteen in minsk set out more measures
but fighting in ukraine has since resumed with a british security official last month telling cnn that the conflict had returned to levels that preceded the ceasefire
military spokesman andriy lysenko said during a televised briefing friday that five ukrainian soldiers had been killed and seven wounded in the past twenty four hours
militants including snipers fired on ukrainian positions using rifles and small arms said lysenko

an american woman has died after being stabbed by an unknown attacker in the restroom of a high end mall in abu dhabi the capital of the united arab emirates police said
ibolya ryan forty seven was taken to the hospital after the attack monday on reem island but died of her injuries abu dhabi police said
she worked as a schoolteacher and had eleven year old twins who are being cared for by authorities until their father the victim's ex husband arrives from abroad police said
authorities previously said she was thirty seven
ryan was stabbed with a sharp tool later recovered by police after a fight broke out in the women's restroom according to col. dr. rashid mohammad borshid head of the criminal investigation department of abu dhabi police
the cause of the fight remains unknown
the suspect fled the scene immediately after committing the crime he said
police have appealed for help tracking down the killer
investigations are still under way to identify the suspect's identity and gender a police statement tuesday said
witnesses reported that the culprit was fully covered wearing an abaya black gloves and face cover
the abaya is a black full length gown traditionally worn by local emirati women
the suspect was also wearing a hijab or headscarf
the u.s. embassy in abu dhabi said it was working with all the appropriate authorities to seek further information about the killing of a u.s. citizen
we offer our condolences to those affected by this terrible tragedy a spokesman said in a statement
the safety and welfare of u.s. citizens abroad is one of the department of state's highest priorities
we stand ready to provide all possible consular assistance
the attack happened at the boutik mall on reem island a newly developed area of abu dhabi where many western expatriates live
the embassy had issued a statement back in october warning u.s. citizens of an anonymous internet post that encouraged attacks against teachers at american and other international schools
the embassy was unaware of any specific credible threat at that time but called on citizens to be vigilant about their personal security
cctv footage released by police shows the suspect fully covered walking calmly in through the parking lot entrance speaking to security guards picking up a paper and disappearing around the corner out of sight
it then shows the suspect running to the elevator followed by others and getting into the elevator before another clip shows the person leaving the mall through the same parking lot doors
violent crime in the uae is rare and eyewitnesses have expressed shock at the incident
the abu dhabi police will spare no effort in order to unveil this heinous crime and bring the culprit to justice said borshid

christianity is a religion frayed over the centuries into many denominations
on sunday pope francis and the head of a major one vowed to heal one of the church's oldest splits
the great schism of one thousand and fifty four separated the catholic and eastern orthodox churches
both profess similar doctrine and worship in similar ways but a millennium ago eastern orthodoxy rejected the ultimate authority of the pope
francis and patriarch bartholomew i the spiritual leader of some three hundred million orthodox christians worldwide signed a declaration on sunday committing to unity between the two churches
together they celebrated a divine liturgy at the patriarchal church of st. george in istanbul on francis last day in the predominantly muslim nation his first trip there
somber intonations and hymns reverberated through the church as the two spiritual leaders prayed and offered reflections and francis tried to allay worries
neither church will submit to nor assimilate the other the pope said in his homily but they will work towards the restoration of full communion
i want to assure each one of you here that to reach the desired goal of full unity the catholic church does not intend to impose any conditions except that of the shared profession of faith francis said
he was at st. george's at the patriarch's invitation which he extended shortly after francis inauguration
sunday's celebrations marked the feast of st. andrew the founder of the eastern church
he was also the older brother of st. peter the founding father of the catholic church
in his part of the call for unity the orthodox leader alluded to attacks by radical islamists on christians
we no longer have the luxury of isolated action bartholomew said
the modern persecutors of christians do not ask which church their victims belong to
the unity that concerns us is regrettably already occurring in certain regions of the world through the blood of martyrdom
over the past decade first al qaeda and then isis have forced christians to flee iraq and syria
far fewer christians remain in areas under isis control
some rely on their faith in god
others pay terrorists a protection tax
growing numbers especially from syria have ended up in turkey.the nation is reeling from the influx of around one point five million syrian refugees the vast majority muslim
religion is also splitting turkey
opponents fear its conservative government will weaken the secular identity of the post ottoman empire
instability rages at its border with isis and its leader abu bakr al baghdadi announcing their intention to take over large swaths of territory for their self proclaimed islamic state
francis is the fourth pope to travel to turkey following in the footsteps of paul vi john paul ii and benedict xvi
the pope was also expected to meet with young people from the salesian community from turkey the middle east and africa before heading to the airport later sunday
salesians the second largest catholic order help orphans and at risk children according to their website
on friday the first day of his visit francis called for religious tolerance and dialogue to counter extremism in the middle east as he met with turkey's leaders
fanaticism and fundamentalism as well as irrational fears which foster misunderstanding and discrimination need to be countered by the solidarity of all believers he said
the world is morally obligated to help turkey care for the great number of refugees it has taken in francis said
in an address given in francis presence turkish president recep tayyip erdogan highlighted what he said was a disturbing trend of increased racism and islamophobia in the west while islamist extremism wracks parts of the middle east
the world must come together if it wants to combat terrorism he said
the turkish leader also suggested the west should not turn a blind eye to abuses committed by syrian president bashar al assad while it pursues isis
the timing of the pope's visit in this period of unrest is extremely significant erdogan added voicing hope that it would lead to an auspicious era of improved relations in the world

francesco schettino captain of the wrecked costa concordia cruise ship took the stand for the first time tuesday combative and contradicting the testimony of not just his first captain but also what he has said in the past about the deadly shipwreck
schettino who is charged with manslaughter causing a maritime disaster and abandoning ship with passengers still on board denies wrongdoing
he faces up to twenty three years in prison if convicted
he remained defiant even while painting a picture of confusion on board the ship as the disaster unfolded pointing the finger at others for the chaotic evacuation of the ship's passengers
five of the captain's co workers have already entered guilty pleas in the case including officers who were on the ship
these pleas may work against schettino as he answers questions with regard to the co workers testimony before the court in grosseto
when shown the deposition given by his first captain ciro ambrosio who pleaded guilty to manslaughter in exchange for a lighter sentence schettino was argumentative and gesticulated wildly
what ambrosio told the court in his testimony is similar to the version of events schettino has given in past tv interviews but the captain contradicted that version in his testimony tuesday
schettino's attorneys argued that what the captain has previously said on italian tv can not be used as evidence in court
the disputed testimony deals with such details as radar readings who was on the bridge at the time of the accident and where those people were positioned
speaking to cnn during a court break schettino said he was confident about how his trial was progressing
it is exhausting but i think it is going well schettino said of tuesday's hearing
it is important because this is the only chance i have to tell my version of events
asked if he thought the court was sympathetic to him he said this is the first time i have had a chance to officially address the court personally so this should be the first time they should be judging me
i am confident
his testimony is expected to continue wednesday and probably one day next week
the cruise liner capsized after it struck rocks off italy's giglio island in the tyrrhenian sea on january twelve two thousand and twelve
no one died on impact but thirty two lives were lost during the subsequent chaotic evacuation of some four thousand two hundred people on board the ship
schettino was sworn in under a giant sign reading the law is equal for everyone in a makeshift courtroom in grosetto's red velvet teatro moderno
as assistant prosecutor alessandro leopizzi questioned schettino the captain described a scene of utter chaos on the bridge both before and after the accident
at one point he explained how it was common to invite passengers and guests on the bridge and said they often tipped him
i said there couldn't be more than twelve people at a time he said
and they would bring twenty thirty seventy euro a tour
he acknowledged frequently conducting flyby activities deviating from the planned route to go closer to certain places with his cruise ship
it was favorable from a commercial aspect he said
when the prosecutor asked if he had ever done a flyby past giglio before he said he couldn't remember but might have passed close by
not trying to blame anyone 
schettino also explained why he chose giglio on this occasion telling the court that he thought retired costa capt
mario palombo was on the island
when the prosecutor asked schettino why he called palombo and then why he asked palombo how deep the coastal waters were he said he was just making conversation
schettino recounted how he gave the orders to the helmsman jacob rusli bin of indonesia to go off course after using his binoculars to look ahead
when asked if his helmsman caused the accident he said
i'm not trying to blame anyone
i'm just trying to explain the circumstances
the captain has suggested rusli bin did not speak english or italian well enough to understand his orders although audiotape played in court tuesday appeared to contradict that
pushed as to why he used his binoculars instead of relying on the radar schettino said it was my habit to take my binoculars and look first
not that i didn't trust the radar but it was how i did it
he was confident that the ship had enough room for the maneuver he said
in an audiotape played over the radar from the bridge extracted from the ship's data recorder schettino told his helmsman to turn otherwise we go on the rocks
asked why he made that comment he said he was being ironic
a few minutes later i was told the danger we were in
schettino appeared visibly shaken putting his head in his hands shortly after radar and audio recordings of the moment of impact were played in court
bells and alarms rang and then the recording went offline
the prosecutor asked schettino about his last words captured on tape
but where did we touch 
the captain asked to which someone said oh my dear god
schettino also will be cross examined by a number of civil parties at the court
they include the attorney for a moldovan dancer who dined with the captain and was with him on the command bridge at the time of the shipwreck
before the hearing began schettino's attorney domenico pepe told cnn his client was ready to tell the truth
we have waited a long time to set the record straight he said
he is ready to defend his honor
schettino has repeatedly presented a defiant face over the shipwreck
he has pointed the finger at the costa cruise company for not providing maps with the rocks he hit appropriately marked
schettino has also blamed the ship saying generators did not work so the elevators did not function which hindered some people's escape

london's metropolitan police have opened investigations into the deaths of three young boys a probe that is tied to allegations of serious and organized sexual abuse it announced thursday
in a statement detectives involved in operation midland an investigation launched last month into sexual abuse dating back more than thirty years ago pleaded for the public's help in tracking down victims witnesses and assailants
today i want to appeal directly to those other young boys now men who were also subject to abuse at the hands of these men detective superintendent kenny mcdonald said
i believe that there were other boys who were abused or who were present whilst the abuse took place
in addition to sex abuse mcdonald said that his team is also investigating the possible murder of three young boys
our work is ongoing and we are examining reports of missing people from that time he added
to date we have not recovered any bodies
the abuse is believed to have taken place over at least a decade at various locations across london and the counties surrounding the capital including military premises the police statement said
one site for the alleged abuse is the dolphin square estate an apartment complex in pimlico central london
one witness known as nick has spoken to us
he has said he was abused from the age of seven until he was sixteen from one thousand nine hundred and seventy five one thousand nine hundred and eighty four said mcdonald
some of the abuse took place at a flat on the dolphin square estate
however i can't rule out this was the only flat used
nick has told police how a car would be sent to collect him and drive him to the apartment in dolphin square mcdonald said
the abuse he has detailed that he was subjected to was carried out by a man on his own a group of men or during what have been described as parties the officer said
police want to speak to anyone who lived in the area from the early one thousand nine hundred and seventy s onwards and may have seen something that they now realize could be significant to this investigation mcdonald said
detectives are in touch with the families of two boys one who disappeared in one thousand nine hundred and seventy nine and another who vanished and then was found murdered in one thousand nine hundred and eighty one but it is not yet possible to say if those two cases are linked to the current investigation he added

on monday kurdish fighters declared that they had released the city on the border to turkey from isis grip after one hundred and twelve days of fighting
the efforts of the kurdish fighters known as the ypg or people's protection units on the ground were backed by an extensive campaign of airstrikes by the u.s. led international coalition against isis
and according to the interviews given to isis aligned amak news agency in syria it was those airstrikes that won the battle for kobani referred to by the fighters as ayn al islam
recently we have withdrawn from ayn al islam bit by bit because of the airstrikes and deaths of a number of our brothers said one of the two fighters his face covered apart from his eyes
he points to a scene of destruction behind him but vows that isis will persist and this is the message we send to obama
the second fighter interviewed by amak stood near a road sign reading ayn al islam
he said isis forces had raided three hundred and sixty villages around kobani from which the people ran away like rats
but the reason behind their withdrawal from the city he said is that we no longer had places to hold there
we were inside ayn al islam and we occupied more than seventy percents but the airstrikes did not leave any building standing they destroyed everything
his horror of the airstrikes was apparent
i swear by god their planes did not leave the air day and night
they did airstrikes all day and night
they targeted everything
they even attacked motorcycles
they have not left a building standing
but by god willing we will return and we will have our revenge multiplied
isis is on its heels after the loss of kobani and an offensive by kurdish peshmerga armed fighters who protect iraq's kurdish region around mosul iraq's second largest city and a focal point for all sides in the conflict
but on friday the sunni extremist group launched an assault on iraq's oil rich city of kirkuk in what may be an attempt to divert kurdish troops from mosul
a report by rudaw a private website dedicated to presenting news from a kurdish perspective said at least thirty isis fighters were killed in the assault and fifteen captured
casualties on the other side included brig
gen. shirko fateh the highest ranking operational commander of the peshmerga brigade located in kirkuk
isis captured fifteen employees working at the khabbaz oilfield southwest of kirkuk after launching their assault in the area brig
gen. sarhat qader the head of kirkuk's suburbs and villages police told cnn on saturday
a joint operation is underway by his police officers peshmerga and kurdish security forces to free the hostages and take back control of the oilfield seized by isis militants on friday qader said
troops have already liberated al assal village also taken by isis on friday and located next to khabbaz oil field he said
meanwhile gen. hussein mansour the head of peshmerga forces in jalawla in diyala province was killed in clashes with isis in southwestern kirkuk saman jabari a senior kurdish figure and local peshmerga leader told cnn on saturday
mansour brought his troops from jalawla about one hundred miles away to reinforce the peshmerga in kirkuk following the isis assault he said
u.s. and coalition aircraft carried out seventeen airstrikes in iraq on friday according to a u.s. central command statement ten of them near kirkuk and two near mosul
both the coalition and the peshmerga are trying to prevent isis from opening a new front in kirkuk which isis likely hoped would lessen the pressure on mosul
additionally by going on the offensive here isis appears to be offering some obvious targets for strikes
if isis can be driven back from positions in kirkuk it will have to try other tactical offensives to draw kurdish forces away from the outskirts of mosul
the kurds on their own admission have no intention of entering mosul but want to choke off isis supply lines into the city
another ten airstrikes were carried out friday against isis targets in syria eight of them near kobani
according to the syrian observatory for human rights a london based opposition group from october six to monday the fighting for kobani killed nine hundred and seventy nine isis combatants three hundred and twenty four ypg fighters and twelve rebels backing the ypg
thirty eight more isis militants died in attacks using booby trapped vehicles or bomb belts and the isis shelling of kobani killed twelve civilians sohr said
on the other hand hundreds of militants died during u.s. and arab allies airstrikes on the city and its countryside the group said
however the success of the coalition airstrikes in kobani will be hard to replicate elsewhere
there are almost no civilians left in the city of kobani and most residents left early on when the fighting started especially in the contested areas close to the front line
this meant airstrikes were fairly straightforward with the coalition able to target one side and avoid civilian casualties
the front line was well defined so it was clear where the isis and kurdish fighters were
a more challenging situation is when airstrikes seek to target isis inside populated areas like mosul in iraq raqqa in syria and other cities under isis control
here the effectiveness of airstrikes is limited because of the risk of casualties among civilians
when coalition airstrikes hit cities in aleppo in northern syria civilian deaths were reported last year

three of the prisoners isis apparently wants back are women a failed suicide bomber an alleged bomb maker and a woman tied to the head of isis
the fourth is a child
many countries have a strategy of not negotiating with terrorists
but this new approach by isis is putting governments to the test
in its most recent demand isis called for sajida al rishawi to be handed over
she is a female jihadi imprisoned for her role in a two thousand and five suicide bombing at a wedding reception in jordan that killed dozens
if she wasn't brought to the turkish border by sunset thursday the militants said two hostages would die
japanese journalist kenji goto and jordanian pilot moaz al kassasbeh
the deadline has passed but the hostages fate is unknown
by negotiating with isis by recognizing them by even having dialogue with them it gives them the impression of acting as a state said sajjan gohel international security director at the asia pacific foundation
jordanian officials have said they are willing to swap al rishawi for the pilot
but they have demanded proof of life to demonstrate that al kassasbeh captured in december after his fighter jet crashed in syria is still alive
former fbi negotiator chris voss said jordan was absolutely right to do so and that the failure of isis so far to provide proof of life was suspicious
it's just a natural and ordinary course of bargains in these types of negotiations and they are choosing not to do that at this point he said
the latest proposal by isis is not a prisoner exchange in the usual sense since the militants now want the release of al rishawi just in order not to kill the two hostages rather than promising their release
voss said entering into this kind of territory with terrorists was dangerous
if you engage in that sort of bargain then they can threaten to kill the same person over and over and over again and continue to demand release of hostages or whatever their demands are he said
you can't give in to that sort of thing because then it puts you in an endless loop where they have all the power
it's important to remember that for isis and groups like them the key factor is gain voss said
kidnappers are in a commodities exchange business
while it's a horrifying concept to us to them it's business and it's the business isis is in and so you have to treat it like that
besides failed suicide bomber al rishawi isis wants two other women an alleged bomb maker and a woman tied to the head of isis and a child
each of the prisoners is symbolically and strategically important for the terror group
al rishawi is connected to isis through her brother once a ranking member of al qaeda in iraq which spawned isis
in exchange for american journalists james foley and later steven sotloff isis demanded the release of aafia siddiqui nicknamed lady al qaeda an imprisoned neuroscientist in the united states linked to nine eleven mastermind khalid sheikh mohammed
she was arrested in afghanistan in two thousand and eight carrying bomb making documents for a mass casualty chemical and biological weapons attack against american targets including the statue of liberty and the brooklyn bridge
one high profile prisoner who isis has not yet publicly demanded is saja al dulaimi
she may be the wife of shadowy isis leader abu bakr al baghdadi who fought with al qaeda in iraq though the iraqi interior ministry has disputed that
regional sources have told cnn that al dulaimi is herself a powerful isis figure arrested as a high value target as she crossed into lebanon with a four year old child whom one intelligence source identified as baghdadi's son
since their capture in march two thousand and fourteen baghdadi has been calling to get his child released a regional source said
in the past in similar cases governments have budged
last year the united states traded several taliban captives for sergeant bowe bergdahl who was captured by the extremist group almost five years earlier
despite claims that bergdahl may have abandoned his post before being kidnapped the state department defended the move saying it was nothing unusual
it is consistent absolutely with what's happened in previous wars including korea including vietnam said state department spokeswoman marie harf adding that there was a long history in the united states of prisoner swaps
complicating the debate one of the five taliban detainees released from guantanamo bay in return for bergdahl last may has attempted to return to militant activity from his current location in qatar by making contact with suspected taliban associates in afghanistan multiple officials told cnn on thursday
during the cold war the west also swapped hundreds of spies with communist bloc countries
in two thousand and eleven israel made a major made a major concession to its arch enemy the palestinian militant group hamas which runs gaza
it exchanged more than one thousand palestinian prisoners in return for the soldier gilad shalit who had been kidnapped in gaza in two thousand and six
hamas celebrated the deal as a major victory and the government of prime minister benjamin netanyahu was heavily criticized
duncan bullivant a uk based risk consultant says swapping prisoners for hostages is still better than paying for release of prisoners as some european countries do
the payment of cash ransom can been seen as the direct funding of terrorist organizations and for that reason and a few others is regarded as unacceptable certainly by the u.s. uk and increasingly other nations he said
there would be nothing unusual about the swapping of combatants and if the japanese victim is thrown in as part of the deal then that is a great bonus
it's sadly far from certain that goto and al kassasbeh will emerge from the current negotiations alive
but whether they gain the release of al rishawi or not isis leaders have very clearly achieved one goal
maximum media coverage for their cause

for months isis has been facing off with the peshmerga armed fighters who protect iraqi kurdistan to the west of kirkuk
it had gone into areas on kirkuk's outskirts but not the central city
heavily armed militants attacked an abandoned hotel in central kirkuk that local police had used as their headquarters
peshmerga and kurdish anti terror units later raided the hotel wresting control of it from the militants and killing three of them according to peshmerga sources
in addition two suicide bombers detonated themselves in an attempt to keep the kurdish forces out
also friday isis militants took over maktab khalid an area about twelve miles southwest of kirkuk after heavy clashes with the peshmerga
among those killed was brig
gen. shirko fateh the highest ranking operational commander of the peshmerga brigade located in kirkuk
photos posted by isis purportedly show the group's militants in control of parts of south and southwest kirkuk burning tents that had been used by peshmerga troops
the u.s. military said friday that an isis chemical weapons expert was killed during a coalition strike late last week
abu malik worked in saddam hussein's chemical weapons program before joining al qaeda in two thousand and five u.s. central command said
he was killed january twenty four near mosul
his death is expected to temporarily degrade and disrupt the terrorist network and diminish ability to potentially produce and use chemical weapons against innocent people the military said
there is no public evidence that isis has a dedicated weapons of mass destruction program
but u.s. central command said
his past training and experience provided the terrorist group with expertise to pursue a chemical weapons capability
kirkuk is a strategically important city in the months long fight one that has pitted isis against the peshmerga iraqi government troops and an international coalition that has carried out airstrikes against the terrorist group
it is one of the few notable cities apart from the region of kurdistan and its capital irbil in northern iraq that haven't fallen to isis
part of its significance stems from the fact its oil reserves are almost as much as those in southern iraq
the kurds and the central iraqi government in baghdad have long wrangled over control of those reserves with each side wanting to keep hold of them
isis which relies heavily on revenue from oil smuggling to fund its operations has been coveting them too
peshmerga forces took over the kirkuk area in june when the iraqi army crumbled in the face of isis advances and have played a vital role in defending it from isis since
in december isis claimed responsibility for a suicide car bomb attack there that killed at least seventeen people and injured more than twenty
the attack according to isis was meant to send a message to the kurdish people and peshmerga fighters
still kirkuk is hardly the only place that has seen recent fighting which may be part of isis rationale for friday's attack there
the group has been fending off an offensive from peshmerga fighters around mosul iraq's second largest city and a focal point for all sides in the conflict that has left the sunni extremist group on its heels
the city of one point five million people on the tigris river has been held by isis since june
isis has invested heavily in governing the city
its leader abu bakr al baghdadi pronounced his leadership of the caliphate at the grand mosque there in july
kurdish officials say that as long as isis holds mosul it threatens kurdistan
likewise neither the government in baghdad nor its coalition partners can rest while terrorists occupy iraq's second largest city
peshmerga forces have made steady progress against isis north and west of mosul over the past two months
they have taken some three thousand square kilometers of the sinjar area as well as the area around the mosul dam choking off access routes and threatening isis main resupply routes
there's little doubt though that isis remains a very real force and threat in much of iraq
the group which calls itself the islamic state still controls a vast swath of that middle eastern nation and neighboring syria
its goal is to have a vast caliphate under its strict version of sharia law with its followers proving they will stop at nothing having been blamed for the large scale killings of civilians mass kidnappings and forcing women and girls to become sex slaves during its quest
that violent campaign continued friday and not just in kirkuk
dozens of gunmen believed to be from isis faced off friday morning about one hundred and seventy five miles away in central ramadi police and health officials in that city said
several hours later that onslaught had been foiled and twenty gunmen were dead according to the officials
elsewhere in ramadi a suicide car bomb explosion at an iraqi army checkpoint killed one soldier and wounded six others
violence flared in other parts of iraq as well that while it hasn't been tied to isis is further proof of the country's unsettled state
six explosions went off friday around baghdad leaving at least seven dead and twenty three wounded according to police officials
the deadliest such blast was in bab al sharji a busy commercial area in central baghdad leaving three dead and ten hurt

rome's jewish community spokesman fabio perugia said on twitter that he and the head of rome's jewish community riccardo pacifici had been filming with a tv crew from italy's canale five following a ceremony tuesday to mark seventy years since the camp's liberation
the crew had finished their work at eleven p.m. and the group tried to leave he said
but group members found they were locked in the camp in subzero temperatures with no security guards in sight
riccardo pacifici then pushed through a window that was in the ticket sales building and the window opened up perugia said
he entered and then opened the door for us
at that point the alarm went off
and we thought good finally someone from security will come to let us out 
however at this point their night got worse perugia said
the security guard arrived indeed but instead of letting us go they kept us there
for hours and hours and hours
they started to interrogate us and they treated us like real criminals he said
perugia said the guards were inflexible and insisted on following procedure
eventually they took the party to the auschwitz police station he said where they were kept until five thirty a.m. and questioned one by one
they don't know how to distinguish between the real criminals and those who were there simply to do an interview and honor the day of memory he said
the incident ended with the party writing down their version of events perugia said adding that they had asked for the matter to be looked into through italian diplomatic channels
a spokesman for the auschwitz museum gave cnn a different account of the evening's events however
pawel sawicki said the italian tv crew had permission to film at the site until eleven point three zero p.m. when they had agreed that they would exit and security guards would come to the gate to let them out
he said cctv footage shows they finished early and went to the gate a few minutes past eleven p.m. rather than waiting for the security guards to come at the agreed time one of them broke into the visitor center and let others in too he said
this triggered an alarm so the security guards came to the building which houses cash registers and an atm
according to protocol they asked the men to show id but they refused to do so sawicki said
the police had to be called since they can only demand that people show id documents he said
the police then arrived and took over the matter he said
while being on the site we have to follow the rules sawicki said
so until the unfortunate incident everything was ok because they had our permission they cooperated with our security and they had the time that they declared they would be leaving
he said the group could also have gone to another exit one hundred and fifty meters away where the security guards were based if they wanted to leave earlier and could then have been let out of that gate
however they decided to act outside the regulations and triggered the security alarm and triggered the whole reaction and then refused to cooperate
auschwitz is a priceless heritage place he said
it must be protected and there must be security

in another the cleanshaven young man in uniform appears deadly serious as one might expect from a fighter pilot whose airstrikes demand precision
behind his military postures was a devout muslim who memorized the quran and hailed from a large family and prominent tribe noted for its loyalty to the monarchy
al kasasbeh's fate had been a mystery since last december when his aircraft crashed during a mission and he was reportedly captured by isis in syria
that mystery ended tuesday when video and images purportedly by isis show the pilot suffered a horrible death
footage and images released by the islamist militants depict the pilot in a cage being burned alive
jordanian state tv confirmed his death but cnn could not immediately verify the authenticity of the tape
the pilot's father safi al kasasbeh described his son as an unassuming muslim
the father made those remarks well before his son's death was disclosed
at the time of the capture safi al kasasbeh told the jordan times that his son was a very modest and religious person who memorized the muslim holy book and was never harmful to anyone
the twenty seven year old pilot was a lieutenant according to the jordan times an english language newspaper published daily in the kingdom
one of eight children moath al kasasbeh came from karak governorate in jordan and graduated from king hussein air college the newspaper said
prior to the announcement of his death a message purportedly from isis had presented an ultimatum to jordan
bring convicted terrorist sajida al rishawi to the turkish border by sunset january twenty nine or the pilot will die
tied to his fate was that of japanese hostage kenji goto whose apparent beheading was shown in a video released by isis militants over the weekend
jordan had said it was ready to release al rishawi if al kasasbeh were to be released unharmed
reeling with shock at how the pilot was murdered jordanian officials were said to be considering a military response to isis's claims
king abdullah condemned the killing and said that the brave pilot was killed in defense of his religion his country and his nation
it is the duty of the sons and daughters of jordan to stand together and show the mettle of the jordanian people in unity determination and resolve the king said
a jordanian official said the pilot was actually killed a month ago in early january
the purported immolation is a macabre closure to al kasasbeh's life
while he was still considered missing the family's desperation grew as time passed and as al kasasbeh's fate was linked to that of goto and the release of al rishawi
goto appeared to hold a picture of the pilot now bearded in a video message purported to be from isis that was released in january
on the same day safi al kasasbeh joined hundreds of fellow jordanians at a solidarity protest held in the capital amman where he called on the jordanian authorities to act to secure his son's release
i firmly ask whomever has sent moath to fight outside the borders of jordan on a mission unrelated to us to make strong efforts to bring back moath he said
moath's blood is precious
it's precious and it represents the blood of all jordanians he said
the plight of moath al kasasbeh resonated with king abdullah who has been a pillar of the international effort against isis and is himself a former helicopter pilot
the young captive hailed from a high ranking tribe considered especially loyal to the royal family
abdullah's wife queen rania posted an image to her four hundred thousand instagram followers shortly after meeting with the pilot's family
we are all moath it said in arabic beneath a picture representing a fighter jet in the colors of the jordanian flag
from the start jordan has played a pivotal part in the u.s. led coalition against isis but it was not a popular war within jordan which only added to the pressure on the authorities to secure al kasasbeh's release
in late december isis published in its english language online magazine dabiq what it claimed was an interview with the pilot
al kasasbeh was shown wearing what appeared to be an orange jumpsuit
asked whether he knew what isis would do with him he replied
yes
they will kill me
the militants claimed they captured al kasasbeh after he ejected from the crashing of his f sixteen on december twenty four
the pilot was part of the u.s. led coalition airstrikes near isis de facto capital raqqa
images provided by isis's media wing and circulated widely on social media showed bearded men with kalashnikovs pulling the terrified airman out of a nearby river
we entered the region of raqqa to sweep the area then the striker jets entered to begin their attack al kasasbeh said according to the online publication
my plane was struck by a heat seeking missile
i heard and felt its hit
the jordanian government and u.s. central command said the aircraft had crashed but adamantly stated isis had not shot it down as the group claims
i checked the system display and it indicated that the engine was damaged and burning the pilot was quoted as saying
the plane began to deviate from its normal flight path so i ejected
i landed in the furat river by parachute and the seat caught on some ground keeping me fixed until i was captured by soldiers of the islamic state

guinea liberia and sierra leone had a combined total of ninety nine new cases for the week ending january twenty five the who said
the total breaks down to sixty five in sierra leone thirty in guinea and four in liberia
the number of cases continued to fall in liberia and sierra leone who said but guinea's figure rose from twenty confirmed cases in the previous week
the western district of forecariah where the local community has shown high levels of resistance to measures to limit the disease's spread was the worst affected in guinea with half the new cases for the week the report said
the response to the ebola epidemic has now moved to a second phase who said as the focus shifts from slowing transmission to ending the epidemic
to achieve this goal as quickly as possible efforts have moved from rapidly building infrastructure to ensuring that capacity for case finding case management safe burials and community engagement is used as effectively as possible
there have been more than twenty two thousand reported confirmed probable and suspected cases since the outbreak began with almost eight thousand eight hundred known deaths
according to the latest who report children are less susceptible than adults to contracting the virus which spreads through direct contact with an infected person's bodily fluids
people aged fifteen to forty four are approximately three times more likely to be affected than children aged up to fourteen while adults aged forty five and older are almost four times more likely to be affected than are children
even as the number of cases drops scientists around the world continue to study the virus in a bid to understand how it works and help develop more effective vaccines against it
dr. anavaj sakuntabhai human geneticist at the pasteur institute in paris is part of a team working to sequence the virus and monitor how it mutates
it's very important for us to follow what happens with the virus sequence he told cnn
while the virus is not that mutated yet he said it's important for us to monitor how it changes and see whether it is more contagious or more lethal
his team is using samples from blood collected from guinea and processed by colleagues based in dakar senegal who've been working on the ebola project since april last year
sakuntabhai's team has sequenced about twenty samples so far and hopes to do another one hundred in the coming weeks ultimately sequencing several hundred
many people's fears have focused on whether the virus could change to become airborne but it doesn't appear to be easy for it to mutate sufficiently to alter the mode of transmission he said
sakuntabhai said it was normal for the virus to change and that it's not something to be frightened of at the moment

kirchner has sent a draft bill to the country's parliament which if passed would mean the secretariat of intelligence is replaced by the federal intelligence agency
in a taped statement aired monday night on national tv kirchner said the service had not served the interests of the country
the body of alberto nisman a special prosecutor investigating the one thousand nine hundred and ninety four bombing of a jewish community center in buenos aires was found inside his apartment on january eighteen the day before he was due to testify before congress about his claims
the previous week he had filed a report alleging that the president foreign minister and other officials conspired to cover up iran's involvement in the bomb attack which killed eighty five in exchange for an oil and grain for meat deal
nisman died of a gunshot wound to the temple
a gun and a shell casing were found near his body and the apartment was locked from the inside
at first glance a suicide
but the untimely death raised suspicions immediately
then investigators looking into his death said there was no gunpowder residue on his hands as would have been expected and a locksmith who let nisman's mother into the apartment told reporters that anyone could have opened the lock
kirchner who initially called nisman's death a suicide soon reversed her thinking and called it the suicide was not a suicide
however while fernandez does not believe that nisman took his own life she still insists that his allegations against her government are false
nisman was not a hack with an agenda against the president but a naive investigator who was used by others who fed him false information fernandez said
nisman's report promised to provide evidence of the existence of a sophisticated criminal plot deliberately conjured to cover up and provide impunity to the iranians accused in the investigation of the attack of the jewish community center in one thousand nine hundred and ninety four
the two hundred and eighty nine page report makes its case based on tapped telephone conversations between representatives of argentina and iran

in a deathbed statement litvinenko blamed russian president vladimir putin for ordering his poisoning by tea at a london hotel
the kremlin has always strongly denied the accusation
sir robert owen who's chairman of the inquiry said tuesday that sensitive material relating to possible russian state involvement in litvinenko's death would be heard behind closed doors
the british government initially rejected requests to hold a public inquiry but the decision was reversed last summer after litvinenko's widow marina litvinenko challenged it in court
she argued that a public inquiry would enable the fullest possible investigation
an inquest a coroner led investigation that is held as a matter of course in the case of unnatural deaths in england had been opened after her husband's death
but unlike a public inquiry it can not hear evidence behind closed doors
in alexander litvinenko's case such evidence could involve matters of national security
the issues to which his death gives rise are of the utmost gravity and have attracted worldwide interest and concern owen said
litvinenko a former kgb agent and fierce critic of putin came to britain in two thousand after turning whistle blower on the fsb the kgb's successor
he died at a london hospital on november twenty three two thousand and six after being poisoned by the radioactive material polonium two hundred and ten while drinking tea at the millennium hotel in london's grosvenor square
uk prosecutors have asked for the extradition of two men andrei lugovoi and dmitry kovtun from russia in connection with litvinenko's murder
but moscow has refused saying russia's constitution does not allow the extradition of russian citizens
both men deny involvement in litvinenko's death
owen said that lugovoi and kovtun had been invited to give evidence to the inquiry by video link from russia and that he hoped they would do so
the public inquiry will look at possible russian state involvement in litvinenko's death
however it will not address the question as to whether the uk government could or should have taken steps to prevent the murder
litvinenko is said by his widow to have been a british agent with a handler at mi six britain's foreign security service
in two thousand and twelve the counsel to the inquest hugh davies said evidence provided by the uk government showed russian involvement and does establish a prima facie case as to the culpability of the russian state in the death of alexander litvinenko
the inquest has been put on hold while the public inquiry is held
owen the coroner in the inquest said the open hearings in the inquiry should conclude before easter
that is early april
more than seventy witnesses are due to be called over the coming weeks including family and friends of litvinenko those who worked with him before his death medical staff who treated him after he fell ill and the pathologists who conducted his autopsy the court heard
the pathologists will testify wednesday on the postmortem results
the presence of radiation in litvinenko's body complicated the autopsy the inquiry heard
a nuclear scientist will also give evidence wednesday about polonium two hundred and ten its qualities where it can be found and what effect it has on the body once ingested
in the course of the inquiry evidence may also deal with the contamination risk posed to the wider public by the transfer of such highly radioactive material
owen said polonium could have been used to kill large numbers of people or spread general panic and hysteria among the public

another one hundred and two people were injured at least seventy five of whom needed hospital treatment and many suffered shrapnel injuries mariupol city council said
pro russian separatists are blamed for the attack on residential areas in the port city donetsk regional police chief vyacheslav abroskin said on his facebook page
the interior ministry said one person was arrested in connection with the attack
based on preliminary assessments the shells were fired from grad rocket systems a statement from mariupol city council said
the statement also said the situation was under control and urged residents not to panic but to rely on information from official sources only
monitors with the organization for security and co operation in europe said they conducted a crater analysis which showed the use of grad and uragan rockets that likely originated from areas controlled by the pro russian rebel group donetsk people's republic
the shelling comes amid a surge in fighting between government forces and pro russian separatists
u.s. secretary of state john kerry warned of increased international pressure on russia
we call on russia to end its support for separatists immediately close the international border with ukraine and withdraw all weapons fighters and financial backing kerry said in a statement
the white house says vice president biden spoke with ukraine president poroshenko on saturday
they expressed grave concern over russia's blatant disregard for its commitments under the september minsk agreement and unilateral escalation of the conflict the white house said
the two leaders vowed to ensure that the costs continue to rise on russia for its aggressive actions against ukraine
thousands have been killed since the conflict broke out in the spring of last year and a ceasefire agreed to in september in minsk belarus crumbled long ago
u.s. officials took to twitter to condemn the latest violence
today's indiscriminate shelling of mariupol part of an apparently russian backed general offensive in complete violation of minsk agreements said u.s
ambassador to ukraine geoffrey pyatt
russia's escalation continues kremlin's callous disregard for human life on full display in ukraine said daniel baer the u.s. ambassador to the organization for security and cooperation in europe
the foreign ministers of ukraine and russia met this week in berlin to discuss a way out of the violence
but despite the talks violence in the breakaway donetsk and luhansk regions shows no sign of abating
thursday's shelling of a transit stop in donetsk city an attack that ukraine's defense ministry blamed on rebels killed eight civilians according to state news reports
but ukrainian troops have come under heavy fire as well
that includes one hundred and fifteen attacks in a recent twenty four hour period that killed three troops and wounded fifty more ukrinform the ukrainian national news agency reported friday
the osce monitoring mission in ukraine condemned continuing fighting in civilian areas in a statement saturday and urged both sides to refrain from using force in such areas including near donetsk airport
using residential areas as firing positions attracts counter firing to these areas further endangering the lives of civilians it said
all parties need to take robust and immediate action in order to end the new escalation in fighting and its heavy toll on civilians
ukraine and the west accuse russia of sending troops and equipment over the border
in a bid to put pressure on moscow over ukraine the united states and european union have imposed financial sanctions against russian interests
wednesday for instance ukrainian president petro poroshenko said more than nine thousand russian troops our russian ukrainian border bring with them hundreds and hundreds of tanks armed personnel carriers and killing ukrainian civilians and attacking ukrainian troops
russian president vladimir putin blamed the wave of recent casualties on those giving the order to fire in heavily populated areas in remarks reported by the state run itar tass news agency friday
those who give such criminal orders bear responsibility for this
people doing that should know that there is no other way of resolving such conflicts than peace negotiations and political measures he said
putin also suggested ukraine was not interested in finding a peaceful resolution to the crisis and said he hoped common sense would prevail
the conflict in eastern ukraine broke out after russia annexed ukraine's southeastern crimea region as pro russia separatists claimed control of the luhansk and donetsk regions
from mid april two thousand and fourteen to january twenty one the conflict killed at least five thousand and eighty six people and injured at least ten thousand nine hundred and forty eight others according to the united nations
we fear that the real figure may be considerably higher the office of the u.n. high commissioner for human rights said about the death toll in a report released friday
no truce with ukraine rebel leader says

vice president joe biden was originally set to have led a delegation to saudi arabia on obama's behalf
however the schedule for the president's departure from india has been adjusted to allow obama to stop in riyadh himself on his way home white house press secretary josh earnest said
funeral services were held friday for king abdullah bin abdulaziz al saud who died earlier that day
he was ninety
world leaders are now traveling to the saudi capital riyadh to offer condolences for abdullah's death and pay their respects to the new ruler
abdullah was seen by many as a cautious reformer who succeeded in securing broader freedoms in the conservative kingdom but fell short in gaining greater independence for women
his successor who is seventy nine faces a number of challenges as he takes up the reins including iran the rise of isis the crisis in neighboring yemen and the drop in oil prices
but salman has plenty of experience to draw on having served as defense minister and deputy prime minister of saudi arabia a vital u.s. ally in the middle east
like abdullah he is one of the dozens of sons of saudi arabia's founder king abdulaziz
obama is due to arrive in new delhi on sunday on a trip intended to foster progress in sometimes thorny u.s. india ties
on monday he will become the first american president to headline india's republic day parade standing beside indian prime minister narendra modi
why obama's trip to my homeland is meaningful
earnest said obama's schedule had been changed in coordination with the indian government and that he would now be leaving india after giving a speech on tuesday
the president regrets that he will be unable to visit agra during this trip earnest said
agra is where the spectacular taj mahal mausoleum is located
biden will now remain in washington rather than go to saudi arabia
although no reason for the change of plan was given it follows criticism this month of the obama administration for its failure to send a senior representative to france for a huge unity march held in the wake of the paris terror attacks
the administration admitted it erred and dispatched u.s. secretary of state john kerry to paris the following week to offer the united states support and condolences
speaking to cnn's richard quest in davos switzerland on friday kerry said he expects no changes in his government's relations with saudi arabia with the change of kings
i don't anticipate anything based on the conversation we have had no he said
jordan's king abdullah and egypt's president abdel fattah al sisi both left davos early to attend the funeral on friday
in line with custom abdullah was laid to rest in an unmarked grave in a brief and simple ceremony after funeral prayers in riyadh's imam turki bin abdullah grand mosque

president abdu rabu mansour hadi's resignation thursday came after houthi rebels kidnapped his chief of staff seized control of key government buildings in the capital sanaa and failed to abide by provisions of a tentative peace deal hammered out wednesday
the chaos in yemen is cause for concern far beyond the country's borders
for the united states and its allies yemen's government has been a key ally in the fight against al qaeda in the arabian peninsula the yemen based group linked to attacks such as the recent slaughter at french magazine charlie hebdo
for the moment uncertainty rules
beyond it yawns the prospect of a political vacuum and growing sectarian rift that terror groups such as aqap could exploit
meda al rowas a senior analyst at ihs country risk told cnn that unless hadi is reinstated the chances of the country avoiding armed conflict are slim
our forecast is really civil war in yemen because we have a lot of nonstate armed groups who are likely to compete over territory and have a lot of competing agendas she said
who is in charge right now really depends on where in yemen you are she said
the houthis shiite muslims who have long felt marginalized in the majority sunni country have taken control of sanaa and the northern provinces of amran and sadaa
but there has already been resistance to their attempted takeover of national government institutions from different groups in yemen particularly in the south where there's a long running secessionist movement and in the oil rich province of marib to the east of sanaa
this really creates a situation where even if the houthis keep control over sanaa they have little chance of taking control of the whole country said al rowas
we expect to see armed resistance
it's possible that hadi himself a southerner could rescind his resignation and put a gulf cooperation council initiative for a negotiated transition of power back on track
but that seems unlikely at present
according to the national news agency saba yemen's parliament is due to hold an extraordinary session sunday called by parliament speaker yahya al rai
analysts suggest that because there's no vice president the speaker could be next in the line of succession taking on the role of acting president
he's close to former president ali abdullah saleh who clung to power until being forced out by international pressure two years ago
despite their takeover of sanaa it's unclear whether the houthis really want to take charge of the country
the group more likely wanted hadi to remain in power as a figurehead behind whom they could pull the strings without having to take on the burdensome business of governance said al rowas
under wednesday's failed peace deal the hadi government had agreed to rewrite parts of the country's constitution to give the houthis more political power in return for them withdrawing their militias from key government institutions and freeing the president's kidnapped aide
the government only finally got parliamentary approval in december said u.s. based yemen analyst sama'a al hamdani
hadi's resignation seems to be a recognition of the fact that he won't be able to lead the country as he wishes because of the houthi takeover she said
the houthis are shiites from northern yemen who make up about thirty percents of the population
they've been at war with the central government for the best part of a decade and are also fighting the sunni aqap
at the beginning of two thousand and fourteen they won a series of battles close to the saudi border
and in september houthi fighters suddenly descended on sanaa where they took over government buildings the main airport and a share of power
in the past week they've taken it to another level
although they have been fighting aqap they are no friend to the united states
one of the main slogans of this historically iranian backed group is death to america
the houthis have more recently forged an alliance with supporters of former president saleh said al rowas
this facilitated the houthis southward expansion but the alliance is fragile she said not least because saleh in the past waged military campaigns against the houthis
al qaeda's yemen affiliate aqap is perhaps the best known group internationally
it first emerged in saudi arabia in two thousand and two but thanks to the efforts of saudi authorities was a mostly a spent force by two thousand and five according to analysis from jane's world insurgency and terrorism
it re emerged reinvigorated in yemen in two thousand and nine after the saudi outfit merged with a yemeni al qaeda counterpart
besides battling the yemeni government and houthis it has been involved in international terror attacks including the failed two thousand and nine attempt to bring down an airliner over detroit
the muslim brotherhood is also a powerful group in yemen in the shape of the al islah party and is well represented in the transitional government
it loathes the houthis and has its own militias
the fighting in yemen also provides an opening to isis which is keen to outflank al qaeda and prove itself the true defender of the faith
in november isis leader abu bakr al baghdadi called on yemeni sunnis to resist the houthis
there are also a number of heavily armed rural tribes that will fight for control over their territories
while in power hadi and the government of prime minister khaled bahah have been trying to fight aqap on the ground and also have authorized u.s. drone strikes in the country against terror targets
as part of those efforts the united states has several hundred american diplomats and military personnel in yemen
but the u.s. embassy has been on reduced staffing since september
the houthis have publicly said they oppose u.s. drone strikes and u.s. involvement in yemen
there are currently no talks with the houthis but there are discussions about whether to talk to them according to u.s. officials
multiple policy options are being considered the officials said though there is no consensus yet about how to proceed
the safety and security of u.s. personnel is our top priority in yemen u.s. state department spokeswoman jen psaki said
we are evaluating the security situation on the ground on an ongoing basis
we call on all parties to abide by their public commitments to ensure the security of the diplomatic community including our personnel
al hamdani the yemen analyst said she didn't see an immediate need to pull u.s. personnel out of yemen
i think yemen is safe at the time being she told cnn's wolf blitzer
the houthis have been in charge for a while
they have popular committees all over the capital of sanaa and they've been running the security show
i do however want to say that the americans might need to start talking to the houthis
and if the americans are talking to iran in back channels they need to do the same with the houthis
since hadi's resignation there has been a lot of anger against the houthis in parts of the country said al rowas the ihs country risk analyst
while hadi wasn't able to unify the country while in power she said since the houthi takeover of sanaa he has become the popular symbol of anti houthi sentiment across southern and central yemen
many there are calling for his return she said
a chief flashpoint for popular anger may be the central marib province she said
there have already been some low level confrontations and tribes are mobilizing in the area
large scale protests have also been seen in aden the main seaport in the country's south where the current chaos plays into the hands of the secession movement
seven things to know about yemen

the conservator who spoke on condition of anonymity told egypt's state owned ahram online that the mask's beard broke off by accident when the mask fell as it was being cleaned last year at the egyptian museum in cairo
he said the blue and gold braided beard was fixed back in place quickly with epoxy a type of strong adhesive
the epoxy was not a proper material to use to restore the mask although it is a conservation material with a very high strength for attaching metal and stone he is quoted as saying
the conservator said there was now a gap between the face and the beard where the glue had dried
however the egyptian museum's general director mahmoud el halwagi dismissed the claims in an interview with ahram online saying the beard was in its original position and that nothing had happened to the mask since he took up his position in october
an archaeological committee was assigned to inspect the mask and beard in order to write a detailed report on the mask's condition he said
minister of antiquities mamdouh eldamaty also told ahram online that media reports of damage to the mask were unfounded
the boy king's elaborate burial mask discovered in his tomb in one thousand nine hundred and twenty two is one of egypt's most outstanding artifacts
tutankhamun who ruled from one thousand three hundred and thirty six one thousand three hundred and twenty seven bc is thought to have been about seventeen years old when he died based on analysis of his mummy according to the british museum
his cause of death is not known
if confirmed it won't be the first time a historical treasure was damaged in an institution supposed to keep it safe
in two thousand and six a visitor to the fitzwilliam museum in cambridge england famously tripped on a staircase and smashed three hugely valuable chinese qing dynasty vases
the thousands of porcelain fragments were eventually painstakingly reassembled

abdullah died early friday several weeks after the state run saudi press agency said he was suffering from pneumonia and had been admitted to a hospital
the royal court didn't release an exact cause of death
he was ninety
to ensure a smooth transition the kingdom quickly appointed his seventy nine year old half brother salman bin abdulaziz to the throne
his half brother prince muqrin a decade younger is the new crown prince
after friday afternoon prayers at riyadh's imam turki bin abdullah grand mosque the body of abdullah wrapped in a pale shroud was carried from the mosque toward a cemetery followed by a solemn procession of saudi men in traditional dress
he was later laid to rest after a simple swift ceremony
those present at the graveside the royals closest to the late king were then to move on to a royal palace where they were to pay their respects to the new monarch
the ceremony of al bayaah or pledging of allegiance to the new king followed the funeral
condolences and remembrances poured in from all corners of the globe
to god we belong and indeed to him we shall return said the homepage of the english language saudi newspaper arab news
bahrain jordan and the palestinian territories among others declared days of mourning
the u.n. secretary general praised abdullah for his arab peace initiative to end the arab israeli conflict
u.s. vice president joe biden said he would lead a delegation in the coming days to pay respects
king abdullah's life spanned from before the birth of modern saudi arabia through its emergence as a critical force within the global economy and a leader among arab and islamic nations u.s. president barack obama said in a statement
speaking to cnn's richard quest in davos switzerland u.s. secretary of state john kerry said he expects no changes in his government's relations with saudi arabia
i don't anticipate anything based on the conversation we have had no he said
in an address to the nation his first televised appearance since becoming king salman offered his condolences to the saudi people
we will with god's will and power adhere to the straight path this country followed since its establishment by king abdulaziz and his sons after him and will not deviate at all from it since our constitution is the book of allah and the teachings of prophet mohammed he said
he also spoke of the desperate need for unity and solidarity among the followers of islam saying saudi arabia would continue to promote that
he had already issued six royal decrees friday the saudi press agency reported including appointing prince mohammed bin naif bin abdulaziz as the deputy crown prince
salman who has one point three three million followers on twitter but follows no one changed his twitter handle to kingsalman
abdullah became king of the oil rich nation a key u.s. ally in the middle east in august two thousand and five
but he had been running saudi arabia since one thousand nine hundred and ninety six after half brother king fahd's stroke
in the context of the kingdom's conservative circles abdullah was seen as a reformer and often came up against more hardline clerics
after ascending to the throne abdullah took steps toward broader freedoms and invested some of the country's vast oil wealth in large scale education and infrastructure projects
he was really quite extraordinary figure
he was probably the most progressive and liberal minded king of saudi arabia since king faisal which is a long time ago in the early one thousand nine hundred and seventy s cnn's fareed zakaria said about abdullah whom he described as much loved
i had the opportunity to meet with him once and what you got a sense of was somebody who really was determined to move his country forward zakaria said
it's a conservative country and a conservative society and he kept emphasizing that to me but he was very clear in the direction he wanted to go
however resistance from conservative factions hindered some of his efforts leaving many women in particular disappointed by a lack of progress toward greater independence
under abdullah's leadership the country slowly squashed al qaeda capturing or killing its leaders in the kingdom forcing the remnants underground and sidelining radical preachers
it also took a more prominent role in international affairs
last year it became the lead arab nation in a u.s. led coalition to eradicate the ultraradical isis group in iraq and syria
analysts are predicting a smooth political transition despite the many challenges facing saudi arabia including iran the rise of isis the crisis in yemen and the drop in oil prices
saudi arabia has sixteen percents of the world's known oil reserves according to the u.s. energy information administration
the country is widely seen as the leader of opec and has a large influence on energy prices and political stability in the middle east
remember the last time the price of oil fell like this the soviet union collapsed said zakaria
that said the successor is a very competent man
he added
i don't expect any major shift but it marks a big change and we'll have to see what the new king is like

firstly i think i must want for the record to refer to the events that have taken place in the last three weeks
and i just wish to reiterate and to reaffirm the statements which have already been made on my behalf by buckingham palace he said thursday at the world economic forum
earlier this month buckingham palace issued a statement which said it is emphatically denied that the duke of york andrew had any form of sexual contact or relationship with the woman
any claim to the contrary is false and without foundation
andrew is a son of queen elizabeth ii and a brother of prince charles the next in line for the british throne
the prince is accused of having sex with the woman when she was seventeen details of which are is a sworn affidavit in florida court dated january nineteen
the woman said that she and the prince had sex three times including one orgy
the court documents showed that her lawyers had sent a letter to buckingham palace asking to interview the prince under oath
in her sworn affidavit the woman described buckingham palace's denial that sexual contact ever took place between the pair as false and hurtful to me
the woman identified by buckingham palace as virginia roberts first named the prince in a civil motion filed december thirty in the u.s. district court in southern florida in which she claims she was forced to have sex with several men
she is referred to as jane doe no
three in the legal filings
in the letter the woman's lawyers sent to buckingham palace attorneys paul cassell and bradley edwards asked to interview prince andrew under oath regarding interactions that you had with jane doe no
three beginning in approximately early two thousand and one
jane doe no
three was then seventeen years old
the letter includes a picture of the woman and andrew which was taken around that time they say
the lawyers also want to discuss subsequent interactions with their client in new york city later that year the letter says
the interview could be conducted at a time and place of your choosing and with your cooperation i believe the interview could be completed in two hours or less it says
new court pleadings involving the relationship between jane doe no
three and the prince are being prepared the letter adds but their filing will be delayed if andrew accepts the interview request by january nineteen
the attorney for her legal team confirmed to cnn that buckingham palace had refused to accept the letter to prince andrew and that it was returned to them
buckingham palace didn't respond thursday when asked by cnn about the letter
but the woman's allegations have previously been firmly rejected by buckingham palace
it is emphatically denied that the duke of york had any form of sexual contact or relationship with virginia roberts
any claim to the contrary is false and without foundation the palace said early this month
prince andrew is named in the court filing in florida as one of a number of prominent people who allegedly had sexual contact with teenage girls through self made billionaire jeffrey epstein who pleaded guilty some years ago in florida to a state charge of prostitution solicitation
cnn was unable to reach martin weinberg epstein's attorney on thursday
in her first sworn statement to the court jane doe no
three gave more details of the alleged encounters
epstein made me have sex with prince andrew several times she said according to the court document
i had sex with him three times including one orgy
i knew he was a member of the british royal family but i just called him andy 
one day when she was in london she said epstein told her she would be meeting a major prince
she continued
epstein told me to exceed everything i had been taught
he emphasized that whatever prince andrew wanted i was to make sure he got
when the prince arrived she was introduced she said and we kissed formally cheek to cheek
the group went for dinner and to a nightclub where she was served alcohol before returning to the townhouse
the picture referred to in the letter of the prince with roberts was taken there she said
after the pair were left alone she said we went to the bathroom and bedroom which were just steps away from where the picture was taken
we engaged in sexual activities there
afterwards andy left quickly with his security
she said she had reported back to epstein on the encounter next day telling him it went great
i told epstein about andy's sexual interests in feet
epstein thought it was very funny
epstein appeared to be collecting private information about andy she added
roberts also gave details of two more alleged occasions when the pair had sex
one was in epstein's new york mansion in spring two thousand and one she said when she was seventeen
the third and last occasion was at an orgy involving nine girls on epstein's private island in the u.s. virgin islands her statement said
i was around eighteen at the time
epstein andy approximately eight other young girls and i had sex together
the other girls who appeared to be under eighteen were european looking and sounding and didn't really speak english she said
she said she felt disgusted after the orgy
roberts rejected the palace's denial of the allegations and said she hoped andrew would agree to be interviewed under oath
i did have sexual contact with him as i have described here under oath she said
given what he knows and has seen i was hoping that he would simply voluntarily tell the truth about everything
roberts and another woman are seeking to join two other women who are arguing in federal court for the u.s. government to reexamine its case involving epstein
the investment banker agreed to a state plea deal in two thousand and seven and began serving an eighteen month sentence in two thousand and eight according to court documents
he pleaded guilty to solicitation of prostitution and procurement of a minor for prostitution

the resignations of yemeni president abdu rabu mansour hadi and other officials are the latest fallout from the houthis move in recent days to gain power in the capital which included kidnapping hadi's chief of staff on saturday and taking over the presidential palace on tuesday
the chaos in yemen is cause for concern far beyond the country's borders
for the united states and its allies yemen's government has been a key ally in the fight against al qaeda in the arabian peninsula the yemen based group linked to attacks such as the recent slaughter at french magazine charlie hebdo
the united states responded by reducing embassy personnel in the capital because of security concerns a senior state department official said thursday night
while the embassy remains open and is continuing to operate we may continue to re align resources based on the situation on the ground the official said
the cabinet and prime minister khaled bahah resigned before hadi did on thursday night with bahah telling hadi in a letter that they essentially wanted to wash their hands of destructive political chaos an apparent reference to the deal that was to give houthis more power
we resigned so that we are not made party to what is going on and what will happen bahah wrote in the letter which yemeni information minister nadia sakkaf posted on twitter
hadi's resignation came soon afterward
it wasn't immediately clear who would succeed hadi
the houthis latest push to power picked up steam on saturday
the houthi rebels shiite muslims who have long felt marginalized in the majority sunni country kidnapped presidential chief of staff ahmed bin mubarak in the capital sanaa on saturday
the rebels then took over the presidential palace tuesday prompting talk of a coup
the tentative deal reached wednesday called for bin mubarak's release as well as measures to give the houthis more political power according to a yemeni official with access to a draft text of the agreement
but by thursday before the top officials quit sakkaf questioned whether the rebels would live up to their side of the pact
ahmed mubarak is still houthis hostage despite deal
they got what they want why should they fulfill their promise 
she said on twitter
she added i have been following up the promises to release dr. ahmed bin mubarak since the beginning
conclusion
buying time
mistrust was hampering the implementation of the peace deal both sides said thursday
one yemeni presidential adviser told cnn the government was waiting for the houthis to release bin mubarak but acknowledged that the rebels have withdrawn some forces
ahmed al bahri a houthi official said they were unsure of how serious hadi was about the deal and that they were keeping twenty percents of their militia numbers in the presidential palace and other key buildings as a guarantee
questions about who was in charge over the past few days have sparked concerns that a power vacuum could help terrorist groups get a stronger foothold
besides the charlie hebdo attack aqap also tried to blow up a plane landing in detroit in two thousand and nine
isis is also recruiting in yemen to expand its ranks
under the peace deal the houthi rebels agreed to withdraw their militias from key government institutions if officials take a significant step
rewriting parts of the country's constitution according to the yemeni official
under its terms the government would accept changes in the draft of the new constitution that would grant the houthis more political power
word of the deal still leaves many questions unanswered
what could the reshaped constitution look like 
how much power will the rebels get 
u.s. officials said they're unclear about the intentions of the houthis
do they want to run the government 
or be a powerful opposition 
there are currently no talks with the houthis but there are discussions about whether to talk to them according to u.s. officials
multiple policy options are being considered the officials said though there is no consensus yet about how to proceed
several of the constitutional changes sought by the houthis would emphasize the characteristics of yemen as a federal state and push for more inclusion of diverse groups
seven things to know about yemen
the houthis call for marginalized political groups to have the right to partnerships in state institutions and fair representation according to the text of the tentative agreement
in return for these government concessions the rebels basically agree to withdraw their fighters from the capital where they control or blockade several government installations
the presidential palace the presidential residence the prime minister's residence and a military installation where missiles are housed
a houthi official said the rebels would abide by the deal if the president follows a timeline specified in the negotiations for the political process
this isn't the first time the rebels and the government have hammered out an agreement
houthis swept into the capital last year sparking battles that left more than three hundred people dead in a month
in september they signed a ceasefire deal with the government and houthis have since installed themselves in key positions in the government and financial institutions
as violence flares seven things to know about yemen

the fatalities are among at least ten civilians killed total in addition to twenty injured in the shelling of four city districts in the past twenty four hours the donetsk city council said on its website
ukraine's state run ukrinform news citing the donetsk government reported eight dead and seven hospitalized in the bus stop attack alone
donetsk has been a stronghold for separatists who have been battling government forces for control of the donetsk and luhansk regions since the spring
as of now the situation remains difficult the city council said
and as has been the case with many incidents in the conflict there was no universally accepted explanation of what happened or who was responsible
russia's foreign ministry demanded an investigation and criticized ukraine for its shelling of ukrainian cities like donetsk which are controlled or at least full of pro russian separatists
yet ukraine's defense ministry blamed the rebels for the attack saying it was launched from areas they control
the organization for security and cooperation in europe which has a monitoring mission in ukraine is among those trying to get to the bottom of it all
its deputy chief monitor alexander hug told reporters that an ocse patrol saw seven bodies near a vehicle that had been hit
and it's not the only instance of violence in the area
terrorists using multiple launch missile systems precisely destroy houses in the donetsk region cities of debaltseve and avdiyivka ukrinform reported citing donetsk regional police chief vyacheslav abroskin
rebels captured sixteen wounded ukrainian soldiers after fighting at donetsk's airport kiev's military said according to ukrinform
negotiations are underway to secure their release
and the osce in an update posted wednesday cited numerous instances of shelling in recent days with two hospitals in separatist held territory among the buildings affected
as u.s. gen. philip breedlove nato's supreme allied commander europe pointed out thursday
violence has intensified and changed character in ukraine
as has been true so often in recent months the violence is happening around the same time as negotiations aimed at stopping it
the latest talks happened wednesday in berlin and included the foreign ministers of ukraine and russia as well as germany and france
their official aim was to resolve the crisis by hammering out how to implement a peace deal that was agreed upon last year
after wednesday's talks the four foreign ministers condemned the continuing violence and called for the peace deal that was reached in minsk belarus last september to be respected
fighting in the donetsk and luhansk regions has severely escalated causing the loss of many human lives including civilians
this must stop immediately and the regime of quiet must be restored the ministers said
they said tangible progress must be made on full implementation of the minsk pact ahead of a planned peace summit
the attack on the donetsk trolley bus station obviously doesn't help the situation
russia's foreign ministry called it a a crime against humanity a great provocation aimed to undermine the efforts for the peaceful settlement of the crisis
the unrest began in late two thousand and thirteen leading up to parliament's ouster last february of pro moscow president viktor yanukovych
russia annexed the crimean peninsula a few weeks later with fighting breaking out in april in two ukrainian regions bordering russia donetsk and luhansk
separatist leaders there declared independence from ukraine and sided with russia
but how much was and is moscow involved in their campaign 
it depends who you ask
officials in moscow have expressed sympathy for the separatists but denied any outright military support
however ukraine and its allies have accused russia of fomenting the rebellion by actively backing it
it is clear that russia has to stop supporting the separatists and respect international law said danish gen. knud bartels chairman of the military committee for nato which doesn't include ukraine but is working to further its military to military cooperation with kiev
on wednesday ukrainian president petro poroshenko reasserted a claim that russia sent troops across the border to support the rebels
we have more than nine thousand russian troops who so called lost the way crossing our russian ukrainian border bring with them hundreds and hundreds of tanks armed personnel carriers and killing ukrainian civilians and attacking ukrainian troops poroshenko told cnn
russian foreign minister sergey lavrov speaking in moscow before the berlin talks responded to ukraine's assertion with a firm denial much like other denials made by russian officials in recent months over similar allegations of armed intervention
as to the flow of troops and armaments this is not the first time we hear something like that he said
and each time i hear that i say if you're so confident about that please present us with facts but no one has been able to provide us with these facts

valls said close to three thousand people in france with jihadist ties needed to be under surveillance and that the number of people with links to networks in iraq and syria had increased by one hundred and thirty percents in the past year
in response to the threat two thousand six hundred and eighty new jobs will be created of which intelligence services alone will account for one thousand one hundred he said
many of the new jobs will be dedicated to tackling the threat from online jihadism
france will allocate four hundred and twenty five million euros over the next three years to boost the fight against extremism valls said
these resources will be used to buy new equipment such as bulletproof vests and better weapons for police officers
valls also said a new bill would be presented in april aimed at reinforcing the intelligence services legal position in conducting surveillance
efforts for early detection of radicalization will be enhanced within the justice ministry he said
people charged with or convicted of acts of terrorism will be placed on a list and required to report trips abroad or changes of address
other measures are aimed at preventing radicalization in prisons and online
internet companies and social networks will be expected to cooperate closely with authorities valls said
the prime minister also detailed the consequences for those who attack the nation which may include removal from french territory for radical islamists or loss of french citizenship
the latter measure will need to be validated by the constitutional council on friday
the costs of the new anti terrorism provisions will be met through savings in other areas of public spending valls said
through these measures he concluded the government was sending a message of relentless determination to the french people
valls announcement comes as europe ramps up efforts against islamist extremism in the wake of the paris attacks
the attacks this month against the satirical charlie hebdo magazine and a kosher supermarket have turned the spotlight on links between radical islamists in europe and terror networks elsewhere
al qaeda's yemen affiliate al qaeda in the arabian peninsula has claimed to be behind the january seven massacre by gunmen said and cherif kouachi at the offices of charlie hebdo
and gunman amedy coulibaly who attacked the kosher grocery store on january nine proclaimed his allegiance to the islamic state in iraq and syria or isis
the suspects in the paris attacks may have urged their associates to leave france before the plot was carried out law enforcement sources told cnn
european authorities are concerned that about half a dozen people with ties to the terror suspects are believed to be in syria and could return to europe to launch more attacks the sources said
a western official added the recent arrests across europe are similar to the hyper reactivity after nine eleven in the united states
we've become hyper reactive to any suggestion of islamic extremism and are chasing a lot of ghosts out of an excess of caution the official said
some are legitimate and some are not
from antwerp to aleppo and back
europe's nightmare
in a video released this week a senior aqap leader and spokesman urged all would be jihadists to wage war at home when possible as opposed to traveling abroad
if he is capable to wage individual jihad in the western countries that fight islam such as america britain france canada and others of the countries that represent the head of disbelief in waging war against islam
if he is capable of that then that is better and more harmful said nasr ibn ali al ansi
he continued
but if that is impossible and he is able to serve his brothers on the front lines then let him immigrate for it is better
an off camera interviewer asked why attacks have abated in the united states
by the grace of allah the great the almighty we have made efforts in external work and the enemy knows the danger of that al ansi said
we are preparing and lurking for the enemies of allah
we incite the believers to do that
paris prosecutor franois molins told a news conference that progress has been made in the investigation into the attack carried out by coulibaly but less so in the probe into the kouachi brothers
molins identified four suspects still in custody as willy p. christophe r. tonino g. and michael a. giving only the first initial of their last names and outlined details of the charges against them
none of the four men has been charged with complicity in the kosher market attack
the first three willy p. christophe r. and tonino g. were present when coulibaly bought the renault car that he used to reach the site of the attack
it was found parked near the porte de vincennes after the attack
the fingerprints of the fourth suspect named as michael a. were found on one of the weapons that police discovered in coulibaly's secret apartment in gentilly authorities say
his dna was also found on a glove discovered at the scene of the crime the prosecutor says
in the days leading up to the attack michael a. had exchanged three hundred and sixty two text messages and eighteen phone calls with coulibaly the prosecutor says
the two men met on january five four days before coulibaly's attack
the four men in custody all in their twenty s were among nine people arrested in a police operation friday
five other suspects held since friday were released monday night
amid heightened concern over the threat posed by radical islamists in europe belgium and germany have cracked down on alleged extremists in recent days
belgian authorities continue the hunt for the ringleader behind a terrorist cell targeted in countrywide raids last week in which two suspects died
the suspected key link between senior isis operatives in syria and the belgian terrorist cell belgian moroccan isis fighter abdelhamid abaaoud is still at large a senior belgian counterterrorism official said monday
his last known location was greece the official said
one line of inquiry being looked at is whether abaaoud tried to fake his own death last year while fighting with isis in syria so that he could disappear off the radar screen of western intelligence services
in october his family in brussels received word he had been martyred his sister told a belgian newspaper
belgian investigators believe abaaoud rather than dying on the front lines traveled to greece and suspect he was communicating by phone from there with the terrorist cell in belgium
despite an international manhunt involving both american and european intelligence agencies abaaoud remains at large
the concern is he will return to syria before he can found
the belgian prosecutor's office meanwhile said wednesday that custody had been extended for three suspects arrested in last thursday's raids
all three are charged with participation at the activities of a terrorist group and violation of weapons laws
one is also charged with armed rebellion in a group with premeditation
that last is marouan el bali who survived the police raid in verviers in which two suspects died
his attorney said he was not involved in terrorism but was simply in the wrong place at the wrong time
the greek authorities have also agreed to the extradition of an algerian suspect named as omar s. the belgian prosecutor's office said
the extradition could take place in the following days
when he arrives in belgium he will be brought before the investigating judge who will decide on an arrest warrant the prosecutor's office said
another suspect named as abdelmounaim h was arrested tuesday and charged with participation in the activities of a terrorist group
he's due to appear before a brussels court on friday the prosecutor's office said
federal prosecutor eric van der sypt said last week that the alleged terror cell targeted in the countrywide raids was on the brink of an attack and planned to target police officers
meanwhile police in berlin brandenburg and thuringen raided thirteen properties linked to suspected radical islamists overnight monday to tuesday
the raids are part of the investigation into two alleged islamists who were arrested friday identified as ismet d. and emin f. berlin police said
both of them are accused of providing logistical aid to isis
those subject to the raids have not yet been accused of any crimes but had contact with ismet d. and emin f. there are no indications that the group was preparing attacks in germany
coulibaly killed four hostages at the kosher grocery store in paris before police killed him
he's also believed to have killed a policewoman a day earlier
new surveillance video obtained by cnn purportedly shows coulibaly and hayat boumedienne believed currently to be in syria outside a jewish institution in paris
a source familiar with the ongoing investigation into the paris attacks says there is a high degree of confidence that the video shows coulibaly and boumedienne
the video was recorded at the end of august or beginning of september and stored on a security camera
the source says the nature of the video makes it clear that the couple were carrying out surveillance of possible targets for months before coulibaly launched his attack against the kosher supermarket
the video was stored because it showed possible signs of unusual activity at the location says the source

the rebels have agreed to release the president's chief of staff and withdraw their militias from key government institutions if officials take a significant step
rewriting parts of the country's constitution according to a yemeni official with access to a draft text of the peace deal
under the terms of the agreement the government will accept changes in the draft of the new constitution that would grant the houthis more political power
word of the deal still leaves many questions unanswered
what could the reshaped constitution look like 
how much power will the rebels get 
and how much control will president abdu rabu mansour hadi have 
houthi rebels shiite muslims who have long felt marginalized in the majority sunni country abducted the president's chief of staff over the weekend then took over the presidential palace in sanaa on tuesday
one government minister called it the completion of a coup but rebels said they had not asked the president to step down
the chaos in yemen is cause for concern far beyond the country's borders
for the united states and its allies yemen's government has been a key ally in the fight against al qaeda in the arabian peninsula the yemen based group linked to attacks such as the recent slaughter at french magazine charlie hebdo
aqap also tried to blow up a plane landing in detroit in two thousand and nine
isis is also recruiting in yemen to expand its ranks
and questions over who's in charge over the past few days have sparked concerns that a power vacuum could help terrorist groups get a stronger foothold
but the deal inked wednesday could signal a return to stability said mohammed albasha a spokesman for the yemeni embassy in washington
the situation is fluid
it's critical
the government was paralyzed
parts of the government dysfunctional but we did not reach the point of no return he told cnn's the situation room
things are difficult but there are things that are moving forward
several of the constitutional changes sought by the houthis would emphasize the characteristics of yemen as a federal state and push for more inclusion of diverse groups
the houthis call for marginalized political groups to have the right to partnerships in state institutions and fair representation according to the text of the tentative agreement
in return for these government concessions the rebels basically agree to withdraw their fighters from the capital
the rebels control or have blockaded several government installations
the presidential palace the presidential residence the prime minister's residence and a military installation where missiles are housed
under the agreement the houthis would withdraw from all of these sites
the rebels would cooperate with the government so that the president and state institutions can return to their duties and would urge all state employees to return to their jobs
a houthi official said the rebels will abide by the deal if the president follows a timeline specified in the negotiations
this deal draws the road map for the political process going forward with the participation of all factions in yemen
in the past timelines were not respected who hope this time will be different a member of the houthi political council said
this isn't the first time the rebels and the government have hammered out an agreement
houthis swept into the capital last year sparking battles that left more than three hundred dead in a month
in september they signed a ceasefire deal with the government and houthis have since installed themselves in key positions in the government and financial institutions
like them or not albasha said the houthis aren't going anywhere and are part of the yemeni political structure
they are now a fact of life
they are now a dominant force in many of the northern provinces he said
we're going to have to coexist and live with them
for days the answers to questions about who's in charge of the country have varied depending on who you ask
even as rebel militiamen stepped up their presence outside the presidential palace a yemeni official told cnn the president does not consider himself a captive
the official said the houthis were assisting hadi's security detail in their protection mission because part of the detail had run away yesterday because of the fighting
a senior leader of the houthi resistance movement abdullah shabaan gave a similar account
he told cnn that the president's personal security left him which forced us to gather hundreds of fighters from our security to ensure he is safe
summarizing the actual balance of power the official said the houthis demands were clear and nobody can hide that they are the dominant force but they still recognize government power
besides the confusion about who is at the helm in yemen the rebels seized military installations it says it will return under the agreement
two houthi field commanders told cnn that rebels had seized control of a massive weapons depot belonging to the government brigade that provides presidential personal security
the houthis had control of two hundred and eighty t eighty russian made tanks and other heavy artillery the field commanders said
while most of the security forces reportedly fled after a light clash with militants the houthis said they captured at least twelve special forces soldiers
on wednesday houthi rebels surrounded a yemeni missile brigade in attan a suburb east of sanaa
the installation is not under control of the rebels but they have it surrounded the field commanders and two government officials said
the houthis said their objective is not to take over the missile brigade but to keep missiles from being moved elsewhere

europe's nightmare
as belgium's search continues other european nations are also moving in on suspected islamist cells amid concerns heightened by the terror attacks in paris two weeks ago
here's a look at the latest developments
police in berlin brandenburg and thuringen raided thirteen properties linked to suspected radical islamists overnight police in the german capital said tuesday
most of the action was directed at a group connected to a mosque in the district of berlin moabit
the overnight raids are part of the investigation into two alleged islamists who were arrested friday identified as ismet d. and emin f. berlin police said
both of them are accused of providing logistical aid to isis
some two hundred police officers were involved in the raids at thirteen sites across three german states
those subject to the raids have not yet been accused of any crimes but had contact with ismet d. and emin f
there are no indications that the group was preparing attacks in germany
five belgian nationals have been charged with participation in a terrorist organization in connection with last week's raids federal prosecutor eric van der sypt said
the terror cell was on the brink of an attack and planned to target police officers he said
belgian counterterrorism agencies say they suspect that the ringleader of the cell is abaaoud the senior belgian counterterrorism official said
abaaoud is also known as abou omar soussi and abou omar al belgiki the official said
according to guy van vlierden a reporter at the belgian newspaper hln who tracks belgian foreign fighters in syria for the blog emmejihad abaaoud is a twenty seven year old from the molenbeek district of brussels who traveled to syria in january two thousand and fourteen and joined isis soon afterward
the two gunmen killed in one of the raids in the city of verviers are belgians of north african descent from the same brussels district
they were in phone contact with an isis ringleader in greece who belgian authorities believe was probably abaaoud
but belgian authorities have not ruled out the possibility that an algerian suspect arrested in greece over the weekend was the key link between the terror cell and isis
that thirty three year old suspect was wanted in belgium on charges of terrorist activity greek police said monday
belgium is requesting an extradition
one suspect survived the police raid in verviers named as marouane el bali
he was taken into custody and faces charges of participation in a terrorist organization and possession of explosives with intent to commit a criminal attack among other charges said his attorney didier de quevy
but de quevy said his client was not involved in any terrorism
he was just delivering shoes to a friend when he was caught in the wrong place at the wrong time
five men purportedly russians of chechen origin were arrested in southern france overnight while planning an act of terrorism according to french media reports tuesday
a cache of explosives was found according to midi libre and other media outlets quoting police sources and the local prosecutor yvon calvet
cnn has not yet been able to confirm the reports
meanwhile the paris prosecutor's office said tuesday that four men arrested friday are being placed under criminal investigation in connection with the paris terror attacks
they are under investigation for association with a criminal terrorist organization with the objective of committing crimes against people
in addition one of those in custody will be under formal investigation for possession or transport of weapons linked to a terrorist enterprise
the four men ages twenty two twenty five twenty six and twenty eight will remain in custody
five other suspects held since friday were released monday night
investigators say dna found in a car used to transport jewish market attack gunman amedy coulibaly has been traced to a man who is already in custody in connection with the attacks according to a source familiar with the ongoing investigation
investigators are still looking for a person whose dna was found on a magazine for coulibaly's gun
coulibaly killed four hostages on january nine at a kosher grocery store in paris before police killed him
he's also believed to have killed a policewoman a day earlier
before the siege he had proclaimed his allegiance to the islamic state in iraq and syria or isis
new surveillance video obtained by cnn shows coulibaly and his partner hayat boumedienne outside a jewish institution in paris
the video was recorded at the end of august or beginning of september and stored on a security camera
a source familiar with the ongoing investigation into the paris attacks says the nature of the video makes it clear that the couple was carrying out surveillance of possible targets for several months before coulibaly launched his attack against the kosher supermarket
new york mayor bill de blasio visited the scene of the siege tuesday and he added flowers to a mound of bouquets candles and handwritten tributes to those killed
he voiced his solidarity with france as it combats terrorism and he met with representatives of the jewish community

we apologize for any fraudulent posts on our behalf

the president has no control minister of information nadia sakkaf told cnn as clashes raged
president abdu rabu mansour hadi was thought to be in his private residence at the time not in the palace
there were reports of clashes near the residence
and the prime minister's residence was under attack from the street sakkaf said
the regime still controlled the city of aden and it closed the port of aden as well as roads leading into and out of sanaa according to yemeni state tv which is controlled by the government
the global stakes are high
yemen is home to al qaeda in the arabian peninsula or aqap the terror network linked to such attacks as the recent slaughter at french satirical publication charlie hebdo
aqap also tried to blow up a plane landing in detroit in two thousand and nine
the battle against aqap has helped make yemen's government a u.s. ally in the fight against al qaeda
a power vacuum often benefits terrorist groups
the yemeni government has been grappling with pressure not only from the sunni muslim aqap but also from houthi militants shiite muslims who have long felt marginalized in the majority sunni country
seven things to know about yemen
we are the victims of corruption and false promises houthi rebel leader abdul malik al houthi said in a televised address on a network controlled by houthis and based in beirut lebanon
the government did not respect the peace and partnership deal from september
we are trying to bring some legitimacy to the government
he complained of economic struggles and poverty
al houthi also said there is an international conspiracy to link yemen to the attacks in paris
yemeni people have two options to move against the foreign agendas or stand against them firmly since they seek to spread chaos in yemen
this is why we moved with the yemeni people though many powers inside and outside yemen are angered
but the yemeni people are with us and understand our goals he said
aqap claimed responsibility for the charlie hebdo attack and u.s. investigators have worked on the assumption that attacker said kouachi met the late american terrorist cleric anwar al awlaki at some point in yemen and received orders from aqap a u.s. official told cnn
tuesday's developments came a day after heavy fighting between government forces and houthis left nine people dead and sixty seven others injured yemen's health ministry said before the sides agreed to a ceasefire
gunfire could be heard sporadically across sanaa on tuesday
unknown assailants fired shots monday night at a u.s. embassy vehicle in sanaa the u.s. embassy said tuesday
the shooters fired first into the air and then turned the guns on the vehicle the embassy said
the vehicle carried u.s. diplomatic personnel and was at a checkpoint near the embassy at the time
no injuries were reported
the embassy is known to use suvs that are recognizable as u.s. government vehicles
two u.s. navy warships moved into new positions in the red sea late monday to be ready to evacuate americans from the embassy if needed a u.s. official with direct knowledge of the planning told cnn
u.n. secretary general ban ki moon called on all sides to immediately cease all hostilities exercise maximum restraint and take the necessary steps to restore full authority to the legitimate government institutions
members of the u.n. security council were briefed by the u.n. special adviser on yemen jamal benomar and later issued a statement expressing their concern about the crisis
they stressed that hadi is the country's legitimate authority
the members of the security council emphasized that all parties and political actors in yemen must stand with president hadi prime minister bahah and yemen's cabinet to keep the country on track to stability and security the statement read
houthis swept into the capital last year sparking battles that left more than three hundred dead in a month
in september they signed a ceasefire deal with the government and houthis have since installed themselves in key positions in the government and financial institutions
but tensions flared again last weekend as houthis said they abducted presidential chief of staff ahmed bin mubarak in sanaa on saturday
osama sari senior media adviser to the houthi movement in yemen said houthis detained bin mubarak because the president wanted to introduce a new constitution without the houthis approval

conflicting accounts from the southeast african nation put the number killed at anywhere from dozens to more than one hundred and seventy
gift of the givers an african nongovernmental organization specializing in disaster response said malawi was facing probably the greatest flood disaster in the history of its existence
in a facebook post saturday the organization said one hundred and seventy three people were confirmed killed and warned of worse news to come
the death toll is expected to rise as it is believed that one hundred and eighty three people have been swept away from one village alone the group said
massive destruction to agriculture roads bridges and general infrastructure including power facilities has complicated the situation due to prolonged power outages
malawi president peter mutharika on wednesday put the number of dead at forty eight
declaring a state of emergency in the areas affected he said an estimated seventy thousand people had been forced from their homes
he appealed for international assistance saying
tents and food are urgently required
rescue operations are also a priority
gift of the givers said that two hundred thousand people had been displaced and eleven thousand homes damaged
a day earlier the u.n. humanitarian affairs agency ocha put the number displaced at about one hundred thousand
medecins san frontiers also known as doctors without borders said friday that around twenty thousand people in the country's southern tip remain cut off from the rest of the country without food health care and ways to prevent possible outbreaks
the current flooding is due to weeks of heavy rain exacerbated by tropical cyclone bansi gift of the givers said
however another storm due to arrive sunday tropical cyclone chedza could present even more of a threat
chedza is expected to be far more destructive than cyclone bansi bringing more heavy rains and greater flooding gift of the givers said
flood rescue and medical teams have been put on standby in case of the worst it said
the organization said malawi's military had already rescued more than four thousand people with the fear that many more are trapped in inaccessible areas
floodwaters up to six feet deep have submerged homes and bridges making access to some areas possible only by helicopter msf said
humanitarian relief is slowly arriving in the district of chikwawa where the waters have started to recede msf said
but other communities downstream in the nsanje district are still in trouble
the floods are behaving like a slow tsunami with the river swelling progressively downstream towards the south and mozambique says amaury gregoire msf's head of mission in malawi
most of nsanje and east bank are submerged under two to three meters of water which has transformed these vast plains into a giant lake engulfing houses and bridges
even though these areas are prone to floods old people i talked to could not remember events of this magnitude
the floods have destroyed crops that many people rely on and swept away their meager possessions raising fears for the future once the waters recede
there's also the risk of outbreaks of disease msf said as those who have fled the floods seek refuge with friends or relatives as well as in camps
msf has been distributing mosquito nets and water treatment kits and building latrines to try to limit the spread of disease
the little mud houses are very crowded and with most wells and boreholes contaminated by the floods people are living in precarious unsanitary conditions said gregoire
gift of the givers warned of the danger of a cholera outbreak as well as other waterborne diseases thanks to the lack of clean drinking water and contamination with sewerage
the u.n. world food programme said friday it was preparing to move stocks of food to the affected areas
this will include more than one hundred metric tons of high energy biscuits enough to meet the immediate food needs of some seventy seven thousand people said elisabeth byrs of the wfp
malawi with a population of thirteen million is one of the poorest countries in the world
more than forty percents of children have low growth for their age as a result of under nutrition byrs said

the people arrested are suspected of providing logistical support for the attacks
the arrests were made in the grigny and fleury merogis neighborhoods and those arrested were in amedy coulibaly's entourage the paris prosecutor's representative said
coulibaly was killed last friday in a police siege to end a hostage taking at a kosher supermarket in paris
he had killed four hostages and is believed to have shot a policewoman to death in the city a day earlier
two days before coulibaly was killed brothers said and cherif kouachi had attacked the offices of satirical magazine charlie hebdo killing twelve people and injuring eleven
they died the same day as coulibaly as police moved in to end a separate siege
there does not appear to be a command and control element to the paris attacks other than a general go forward and do something a western official with direct knowledge told cnn describing the attack as highly franchised terrorism with general instructions
the kouachi brothers legitimately aligned with aqap and cherif kouachi was associated with networks that brought him to yemen to train with the terror group but coulibaly's alleged connection with isis is still unclear the official said
aqap refers to al qaeda in the arabian peninsula
investigators are still trying to determine whether coulibaly coordinated with the kouachi brothers in the execution of the attacks or launched his own attack after learning of their actions said the western official
who were the victims 
france's frayed nerves will not be eased by the belgian authorities operation thursday to dismantle a suspected terror cell believed to be on the brink of carrying out attacks on police
however investigators have so far found no links with events in paris belgian prosecutor eric van der sypt said
meanwhile in the french city of reims about ninety miles northeast of paris the city hall confirmed friday that a police operation had taken place and that there had been gunfire
it's not clear whether this is related to the investigation of the paris attacks
however reims was the hometown of said kouachi
at the same time a man with a handgun entered a post office in colombes a northwestern suburb of paris according to the local police department
police said the man might be mentally unstable and that they did not know yet if this was terror related
according to french media there are up to five hostages inside the post office
in his first visit to france since last week's terror attacks u.s. secretary of state john kerry said that he really wanted to come here and share a hug with all of paris and all of france
standing alongside paris mayor anne hidalgo kerry added that he wanted to express to you personally the sheer horror and revulsion over what he called a living nightmare
american singer james taylor also appeared crooning a customized version of his one thousand nine hundred and seventy one hit song you've got a friend
kerry met earlier with president francois hollande when he voiced the full and heartfelt condolences of americans
we watched the people of france come together with a great sense of purpose and unity
it was a great lesson to the world that once again france's commitment to freedom and passion of ideas has made an important statement to the world kerry said
kerry laid a wreath at a makeshift memorial at the site of the kosher supermarket attack friday accompanied by foreign minister laurent fabius
kerry and fabius spoke there for several minutes with joel mergui the president of consistoire du paris a national jewish organization
kerry and fabius also paid their respects at the offices of charlie hebdo
francois vauglin the mayor of paris eleven th district where the offices are located told cnn that kerry's visit was very welcome
it's so important for us to feel supported at this time he said
the street is still cordoned off as investigators continue to comb the area for clues adding to the sense of disquiet for local residents he said
we know that the threat is still very high and we don't know how long we will be able to withstand this threat he said
president barack obama's administration has admitted it erred by not sending a senior figure to a huge unity march held sunday in paris
more than forty world leaders including the british german and israeli heads of state and russia's foreign minister joined at least one point five million people on the french capital's streets
the goodbyes continue after the attack on the charlie hebdo offices
funerals are being held for magazine editor stephane charb charbonnier illustrator philippe honore and algerian born copy editor mustapha ourrad
the question of where to bury their killers is more contentious
cherif kouachi's widow izzana kouachi has requested that both he and his brother said kouachi be buried in gennevilliers on the outskirts of paris
the gennevilliers mayor's office told cnn that the city was obliged by law to bury cherif kouachi there as he was a resident of the city
but a spokesman for the mayor jean francois boye said that it would not do the same for said because he lived in reims
that's for sure he's not from gennevilliers we won't let him get a funeral here boye said
a survivors issue of charlie hebdo was published wednesday the first since the attack
copies have flown off the racks of newsstands despite a print run of more than four million
however the magazine's decision to run a cartoon of the prophet mohammed on the front cover not for the first time has been criticized by a number of muslim leaders since this is deeply offensive to many muslims
anger over the cartoon boiled over into violence friday in pakistan where police resorted to using tear gas and water cannons to disperse protesters outside the french consulate in karachi
a pakistani photographer for afp was shot and injured at the protest the french news agency reported
he is doing better it said via twitter
ahmed chinoy chief of karachi's citizen police liaison committee told cnn that investigations were underway to determine who shot the journalist
at least two hundred protesters were involved in the violence which broke out after religious parties called supporters out to condemn the cartoon following afternoon prayers chinoy said
the protests come a day after pakistan's parliament unanimously passed a resolution condemning the caricatures printed in charlie hebdo
several french media outlets websites went down friday morning including those of radio station france inter newspapers le parisien and twenty minutes weekly magazines l'express and marianne and investigative publication mediapart
this prompted speculation that the outage could be the result of a hack linked to publication of the charlie hebdo cover
but internet service provider oxalide said it was not the result of a cyberattack
with france on its highest level of alert ten thousand troops have deployed across the country
thousands of police officers are on patrol including hundreds assigned to protect jewish schools
as france still reels from the shock of the paris attacks authorities in neighboring belgium swooped in on an alleged terror cell in an operation that left two suspects dead
prosecutor van der sypt said weapons and police uniforms were recovered as part of raids on a dozen properties in belgium in which thirteen people were arrested
the plan was to kill police officers on public roads or in police offices he said
two people were also arrested in france he said and belgium will be asking for them to be extradited
they are belgian nationals who belong to the alleged cell but were found in france he said
a western intelligence source told cnn that the ongoing terror threat appears to involve up to twenty sleeper cells of between one hundred and twenty and one hundred and eighty people ready to strike in france germany belgium and the netherlands
al qaeda in the arabian peninsula claimed responsibility wednesday for the charlie hebdo shooting
the attack was years in the making aqap commander nasr ibn ali al ansi said in a video claiming u.s. born cleric anwar al awlaki was the mastermind behind it
in the days since last week's attacks security services have been working to track those associated with the kouachi brothers and coulibaly
neetin karasular a suspected belgian trafficker in weapons who met coulibaly's widow hayat boumeddiene is in custody karasular's attorney michel bouchat told cnn on friday
karasular has been charged with association with wrongdoers and offenses relating to firearms in a case handled by the local public prosecutor's office in charleroi belgium
according to bouchat police didn't find any weapons at karasular's house
however the police investigation revealed that karasular used to spend time in a garage in charleroi where documents were found that mentioned weapons
according to multiple belgian media accounts these included documents about the type of gun used by coulibaly in the attack on the supermarket a week ago
bouchat told cnn that his client was not at all connected to thursday's police raids in belgium
according to the attorney karasular wasn't involved in any jihadi group
bouchat confirmed that karasular had previous convictions
how the kouachi brothers were radicalized

as many as twenty sleeper cells of between one hundred and twenty and one hundred and eighty people could be ready to strike in france germany belgium and the netherlands a western intelligence source told cnn
european union and middle east intelligence agencies had identified an imminent threat to belgium and possibly to the netherlands the source told cnn
there is a tremendous amount of concern over sleeper cells in europe said western official with direct knowledge of the situation
authorities worry about a rash of copycat attacks throughout europe according to the official who compared the problem to a slow motion car accident happening right in front of us
intelligence officials in europe were trying to determine the nature of the wider threat a senior european counterterrorism official told cnn
they were monitoring groups of men who have returned from fighting in syria
it is believed isis directed the men to return to europe to launch attacks in retaliation for airstrikes against the terror group in syria and iraq according to the official
overall authorities made seventeen arrests related to the belgium threat thirteen in belgium and four at two locations in france
here are the latest developments related to the terror threat in the west
the suspected islamist terrorists who had a shootout with police on thursday in verviers belgium have ties to isis linked cells in other european countries a senior belgian counterterrorism source told cnn's paul cruickshank
the two suspects who died in the shootout are believed to have fought with isis in syria the source said
a total of one hundred and twenty two thousand police officers gendarmes and military personnel are deployed across france as part of the security plan interior minister bernard cazeneuve said
there does not appear to be a command and control element to last week's paris attacks at the offices of charlie hebdo magazine and two additional locations other than a general go forward and do something the western official with direct knowledge told cnn
the attacks were highly franchised terrorism with general instructions
sectarian turmoil in yemen is bolstering al qaeda in the arabian peninsula's local recruitment and buying it space for attacks against the west and train the next generation of bomb makers according to one western diplomat
metropolitan police assistant commissioner mark rowley britain's senior counterterrorism officer said additional police patrols were being put in place at jewish community centers synagogues and schools
an eighteen year old woman was arrested at stansted airport near london on suspicion of terrorism offenses london's metropolitan police said on twitter
british prime minister david cameron called on his country and the united states to fight the poisonous ideology behind the terrorist attacks that killed at least seventeen people in france this month
britain and america both face threats to our national security from people who hate what our countries stand for and are determined to do us harm cameron said at a white house news conference with president barack obama
obama promised to do everything in our power to assist france in its effort to combat terrorism
two people suspected of involvement with the alleged terror cell in verviers were detained trying to cross from france into italy through the frejus tunnel a spokesman for belgium's federal prosecutor's office said
belgian federal prosecutor eric van der sypt said thirteen people were arrested in a dozen anti terror raids
authorities believed the threat of a terrorist attack was very imminent
the suspected terror cell which included people returning from syria planned to target police officers van der sypt said

at least a dozen people were detained in the paris region overnight in connection with last week's shootings in paris the city prosecutor's office said
two men in their early forty s were arrested in berlin on suspicion of links to isis police said
they did not appear to have been planning attacks
berlin police spokesman stefan redlich said the investigation had started a year ago
the police operation planned several weeks ago
the netherlands said it was not raising its terror threat level currently at substantial the second highest
that means there is a realistic threat but no concrete or specific information of an attack said government spokesman edmond messchaert
the current level of security in belgium will remain for at least one month and will then be evaluated to determine if it needs to be modified the country's prime minister said late friday
from the time we are confronted with an increase in the threat we went to level three on a scale of 4. we must mobilize the resources available charles michel told cnn affiliate rtl
european counterterrorism agencies have been trying to identify and thwart potential threats after the deadly attacks in paris last week in which seventeen people were killed
security services are working to track those associated with the attackers
brothers said and cherif kouachi and amedy coulibaly
neetin karasular a suspected belgian trafficker in weapons who met with coulibaly's widow hayat boumeddiene is in custody karasular's attorney michel bouchat told cnn
karasular was charged with association with wrongdoers and firearm offenses in charleroi belgium
but his attorney said the arrest was not connected to the other belgian raids
coulibaly who attacked a kosher supermarket in paris last friday pledged allegiance to isis
however the kouachis the men who french authorities say carried out the deadly shooting at the offices of the french satirical magazine are believed to have had links to aqap which has claimed responsibility for the shootings
a european counterterrorism official told cnn that there were indications that isis leadership had directed returnees from iraq and syria to launch attacks in europe in revenge for syria and iraq airstrikes
the official who cited france the united kingdom and belgium as countries facing a particular threat said counterterrorism agencies in germany are on high alert
several european nations including the united kingdom france belgium and the netherlands are participating in the air campaign against isis in iraq

as they've trickled out accounts of the bloody attacks on the northern nigerian town of baga and surrounding villages have shocked even those all too used to reports of violence by boko haram militants
witnesses told how the attackers sped into the town on january three with grenade launchers their gunfire and explosions shattering the early morning calm
some terrified residents fled while others took refuge in their homes and were torched with them
local officials reported death tolls ranging from hundreds to as many as two thousand people
but authorities have yet to access the remote area near the border with chad to get a full picture
amnesty international said that satellite images taken on january two and five days later provide indisputable and shocking evidence of the extent of the destruction in baga and neighboring village of doron baga also known as doro gowon
the before and after images demonstrate that the attacks left more than three thousand seven hundred structures damaged or destroyed the rights group said
more than three thousand one hundred of those were in doron baga which was nearly wiped off the map it said
other nearby towns and villages in borno state were also targeted in the series of attacks that started on january three
these detailed images show devastation of catastrophic proportions in two towns one of which was almost wiped off the map in the space of four days said daniel eyre nigeria researcher for amnesty international
of all boko haram assaults analysed by amnesty international this is the largest and most destructive yet
it represents a deliberate attack on civilians whose homes clinics and schools are now burnt out ruins
many of the wooden fishing boats that can be seen along the shoreline in the images of doron baga from january two are gone in the later images the group said
this agrees with witness accounts of desperate residents fleeing by boat across lake chad
another rights group human rights watch has also published satellite imagery that it said showed the results of fires set by boko haram
the rights group said eleven percents of baga and fifty seven percents of doro gowon were scarred by the flames
asked by cnn about the amnesty satellite images mike omeri coordinator of nigeria's national information center said this is a government that analyzes any and all sources of information
amnesty international last week described the massacre as possibly boko haram's deadliest act yet
the nigerian military said that description was quite valid
the attack on the town by the bloodhounds and their activities since january three should convince well meaning people all over the world that boko haram is the evil all must collaborate to end it said
nigeria's government has called for boko haram to be seen as a problem requiring a concerted international response as seen after the terrorist attacks in paris last week
on wednesday a new message surfaced from boko haram's leader abubakar shekau in which he praised again and again the deadly rampage at the charlie hebdo offices in france
nigeria has always said this is a global challenge and viewed as such requires global military action said omeri
the combatants we capture are often not even nigerian
they don't even speak our languages
what started as copycat attacks is now a newly devised network
the government has come under fire from critics who say president goodluck jonathan is more interested in campaigning for the presidential election next month than in dealing with the problem of boko haram
soldiers who spoke to cnn in northern nigeria painted a troubling picture when asked about their efforts to take on the islamist extremist group
they said boko haram outgunned and outnumbered the military on the battlefield
while the militants are equipped with anti aircraft guns on the backs of trucks that have a range of three quarters of a mile they have only ak forty seven weapons with a range of a few hundred yards the soldiers said
adding to their difficulties they are issued only sixty bullets when they go into battle they said while the boko haram fighters have many more
many soldiers also have to buy their own uniforms and lack protective gear they said
morale is low and this is one of the reasons that boko haram is making gains on the battlefield they said
responding to the claims that the military is outgunned omeri said
nigeria is in the process of acquiring new equipment and we will continue to intensify those efforts
in a rare piece of good news nigerian soldiers thwarted a boko haram attack wednesday in the town of biu in southern borno state the military said
the nigerian defense headquarters said five terrorists and two anti aircraft guns were captured
officials gave no casualty tolls but residents told cnn that at least forty boko haram fighters were killed when nigerian soldiers surprised them and fought a lengthy gun battle
omeri said we've always said this is an ongoing process
we're happy that this success has come in quick succession to baga
we hope more will be achieved
the continuing violence has displaced many people from their homes
of the thirty thousand people displaced during the attacks around baga twenty thousand camped in maiduguri city capital of borno state while another ten thousand headed to monguno town nearer baga
others were stranded on kangala island on lake chad
these people are adding to the hundreds of thousands of internally displaced people and refugees who have already stretched the capacity of host communities and government authorities amnesty international said
amnesty international is calling on the governments of nigeria and chad to ensure these displaced people are protected and provided with adequate humanitarian assistance
boko haram has terrorized northern nigeria regularly since two thousand and nine attacking police schools churches and civilians and bombing government buildings
it has also kidnapped students including more than two hundred schoolgirls who were abducted in april and remain missing
the islamist group has said its aim is to impose a stricter form of sharia law across nigeria which is split between a majority muslim north and a mostly christian south

here's what we know about the islamist extremist group
aqap has its home in yemen an impoverished and troubled nation that borders saudi arabia and oman and eyes strife torn somalia across the gulf of aden
in recent months the sunni extremist group has come under pressure within yemen from shiite houthi rebels and government forces
but the paris attack shows the group's apparent continued ability to direct operations beyond yemen's borders
its influence on would be jihadis is also widereaching thanks to its slick english language online magazine inspire first published in two thousand and ten
as military operations in afghanistan and pakistan have squeezed the central leadership of al qaeda its affiliates have stepped forward as the main perpetrators of terror attacks though recently challenged for the spotlight by isis
aqap chief nasir al wuhayshi is al qaeda's no
two and has so far remained loyal to the terror network's leader ayman al zawahiri
he was designated as al zawahiri's global deputy in two thousand and thirteen
aqap late last year issued a rebuke to isis already cut off by al qaeda's general command in february reflecting a certain rivalry between al qaeda and isis as the latter seeks to extend its reach beyond iraq and syria
some analysts say that rivalry could prompt each terror group to escalate
the tension and the competition between al qaeda and isis is tremendous says matthew levitt at the washington institute for near east policy
they're in competition for money
they're in competition for recruits
they're in competition for the attention of the media
he said aqap had recently been eclipsed in the race for global impact
they hadn't carried out anything spectacular in quite some time and were becoming second fiddle to their jihadi competitors in isis he said
meanwhile isis has tremendous things to point to for their success
the holding of territory
they've established a caliphate
the vast majority of foreign fighters who are traveling from around the world are flocking not to al qaeda but to isis
al qaeda in the arabian peninsula first emerged in saudi arabia in two thousand and two but thanks to the efforts of the saudi authorities was a mostly spent force by two thousand and five according to analysis from jane's world insurgency and terrorism
it re emerged reinvigorated in yemen in two thousand and nine after the saudi outfit merged with a yemeni al qaeda counterpart the analysis said
in a video statement released a week after the bloody shooting at the magazine's paris offices aqap commander nasr ibn ali al ansi claimed full responsibility for the attack
we clarify to the islamic world that the one who chose the target laid the plan financed the operation and appointed its emir is the leadership of the organization he said
al ansi described the kouachi brothers as heroes saying they not only accepted their terror assignment but promised and fulfilled
he said the arrangements for the operation had been made by the group's late leader radical american cleric anwar al awlaki who threatens the west both in his life and after his martyrdom
the attack was revenge for the magazine's depictions of the prophet mohammed he said
al ansi blamed not only charlie hebdo but also france and the united states in his statement
u.s. national security council spokesman alistair baskey said the intelligence community was working to determine the video's authenticity
there have been conflicting accounts as to which of the brothers went to yemen or whether indeed it was both and how many times
but a senior yemeni security source told cnn the yemenis believe both were in yemen for about three months starting in april two thousand and eleven
it is unclear how much of the time the brothers spent together
the official added the yemenis do not believe cherif attended language schools in sanaa as his brother had earlier
it is thought likely that one or both of the brothers received weapons training from aqap while in yemen and that one may have met with al awlaki
a yemeni journalist and researcher mohammed al kibsi told cnn he had twice met and spoken with said kouachi in the capital sanaa and that kouachi had briefly roomed there with the failed underwear bomber umar farouk abdulmutallab
investigators believe cherif kouachi was in yemen in two thousand and eleven and that when he left he was carrying money from aqap earmarked to carry out attacks a u.s. official told cnn
the investigators believe aqap could have provided as much as twenty thousand dollar but the united states hasn't verified the exact amount
u.s. officials consider aqap the most dangerous branch of al qaeda according to cnn terrorism analyst paul cruickshank
in november aqap released a statement calling on muslims around the world to forget their differences and renew their efforts to carry out operations against american targets whether civilian military or diplomatic
the u.s. state department's rewards for justice program has posted a reward of up to ten million dollar for information that brings al wuhayshi to justice saying he has provided significant support for aqap terrorist operations
he has been a specially designated global terrorist since two thousand and ten
and while al awlaki was killed in a u.s. drone strike in yemen in two thousand and eleven the radical cleric's influence lives on and with it a threat to the united states says cnn national security analyst peter bergen
al awlaki was an influence on tamerlan and dzhokhar tsarnaev who are alleged to have killed three people in the boston marathon bombings in two thousand and thirteen bergen said
he also influenced carlos bledsoe who shot up an army recruiting center in little rock arkansas killing an american soldier in two thousand and nine
after the attacks bledsoe said his spiritual inspiration was al awlaki
maj. nidal hasan killed thirteen people at fort hood texas in two thousand and nine after sending eighteen emails to al awlaki in yemen a correspondence that was known to the fbi
al awlaki did not direct this attack but he was the key inspiration for hasan
abdulmutallab's botched attempt to bring down an american jet over detroit in the fall of two thousand and nine also was directed by al awlaki bergen said
a video released by aqap's official media arm in december showed a short clip of abdulmutallab together with both al wuhayshi and al awlaki
aqap set out its objectives in a may two thousand and ten statement as the expulsion of jews and crusaders from the arabian peninsula the re establishment of the islamic caliphate the introduction of sharia or islamic law and the liberation of muslim lands according to analysis from jane's world insurgency and terrorism
this suggests the group aims to rid yemen and saudi arabia of non muslims and overthrow the nations governments to be replaced with what it considers to be an islamic state
to that end it has targeted foreigners and government forces in yemen as well as saudi leaders
in two thousand and nine prince mohammed bin naif bin abdulaziz the saudi arabian deputy minister of interior survived a bomb attack carried out by an aqap militant
through its inspire magazine the group also hopes to radicalize western muslims and stoke grass roots jihadist action in western nations the jane's report says
the group's current incarnation is widely considered to be the al qaeda regional franchise that represents the most serious international threat it concludes

groups representing french muslims have urged authorities to step in to protect them in the same way as they have boosted security around jewish sites
all muslim organizations in france are concerned about the numerous anti muslim acts seen in the past few days and call on the authorities to be vigilant to ensure the security of mosques said dalil boubakeur rector of the great mosque of paris and president of the french council of the muslim faith
prime minister manuel valls told cnn's french affiliate bfmtv on monday that a number of mosques had been attacked in recent days with shots being fired in some cases
in other instances religious buildings have been set on fire a pig's head has been stuck to a prayer room door and messages of hate have been sprayed on walls according to french media reports
valls said the thousands of extra police and soldiers deployed to ensure national security since wednesday's attack on charlie hebdo would watch over mosques as well as jewish schools and synagogues
after attacks seven questions being asked about islam
france is at war against terrorism not islam or muslims valls told the french parliament on tuesday
france will protect all its citizens with determination and calmness he said
the union of islamic organizations in france or uoif urged the french authorities to take all the necessary steps to protect muslims and mosques as it rejected any link with terrorists
the group said there have been more than fifty anti muslim incidents including reports of shootings and threats
french muslims are worried and hoping for a rapid return to calm it said
security has been increased at muslim sites
terrorism and crime have no religion the group said in a statement
the uoif absolutely refuses that muslims and their places of worship should be implicated or targeted for terrorist excesses which are only down to their authors
the three terrorists who carried out last week's attacks killing seventeen people in the course of three days of fear have been linked to the islamist extremist groups isis and al qaeda
two of them brothers said and cherif kouachi who stormed the offices of charlie hebdo said they were acting to avenge the prophet mohammed
the magazine has previously published controversial images of the prophet seen as blasphemy by muslims and it's been revealed that the cover of the new edition to be published wednesday drawn by the attack survivors will again feature a cartoon of mohammed
with some three million copies set to be distributed there's scope for an angry reaction from those who see it as deeply offensive
but in his statement boubakeur urged the muslim community to remain calm and avoid an emotional reaction all the while respecting the freedom of opinion
many french muslims turned out in paris and elsewhere for huge national unity marches sunday keen to show they shared in the nation's horror and grief at the events of last week
some held placards saying je suis juif or i am jewish as a sign of solidarity with the four jewish people killed in the supermarket attack picking up on the widely embraced slogan je suis charlie
one young muslim woman named amina who held a sign declaring both statements as she marched told cnn that the killings were not down to religion
it is very important for me because as you can see jews and muslims shouldn't be enemies and they should refuse to be enemies she said
as a muslim amina said she had cried when she learned that so many people had been killed
here in france it is very very very difficult to live when you are muslim because they always think you are a terrorist
and when i heard that again muslims killed people because they were not ok with what they said i was totally ashamed and i was very sad she said
one of the twelve victims in the charlie hebdo attack was police officer ahmed merabet a french muslim of algerian descent
at a national ceremony in paris french president franois hollande eulogized him alongside two other slain officers franck brinsolaro and clarissa jean philippe awarding each the legion d'honneur
merabet's brother malek told reporters that ahmed had been proud of his name proud to be a police officer and proud to defend the values of the french republic
he was killed by false muslims said malek merabet warning of the dangers of a wider backlash against those who share his faith
i address myself now to all the racists islamophobes and anti semites he said
one must not confuse extremists with muslims
mad people have neither color or religion
i want to make another point
don't tar everybody with the same brush don't burn mosques or synagogues
you are attacking people
it won't bring our dead back and it won't appease the families

the french government's work is not over
there's still a lot of healing to do a lot of questions to answer about how to prevent future attacks and the pursuit of a woman wanted in the policewoman's shooting
still as interior minister bernard cazeneuve said the nation is relieved tonight
the wife of suspect cherif kouachi and the girlfriend of hostage taker amedy coulibaly hayat boumedienne exchanged five hundred phone calls in two thousand and fourteen according to paris prosecutor francois molin
the wife told investigators that cherif and coulibaly knew each well
cherif kouachi a suspect in the charlie hebdo slaughter visited yemen in two thousand and eleven and french authorities were aware of his contacts with terrorist organizations in yemen and syria molins said at a press conference
the government of yemen has launched an investigation into a possible al qaeda in the arabian peninsula link to the charlie hebdo magazine attack mohammed albasha yemen's spokesman in washington tweeted friday
al qaeda in the arabian peninsula has claimed responsibility for orchestrating the deadly terrorist attack on the paris offices of charlie hebdo the founder of the magazine the intercept jeremy scahill told cnn
cnn has not independently confirmed this claim
four hostages were killed and fifteen survived in the standoff between an armed terrorist and police at a paris kosher grocery store on friday according to israeli government sources who characterized a phone conversation between israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu and french president franois hollande
u.s. president barack obama said he wants the people of france to know that the united states stands with you today stands with you tomorrow after this week's terror
he told a crowd in tennessee that we stand for freedom and hope and dignity of all human beings that's what paris stands for
the fbi and u.s. department of homeland security issued a bulletin to law enforcement across the united states discussing the paris terrorist attack this week and the sophistication of the tactics a u.s. law enforcement source told cnn
the bulletin says the attacks demonstrated a degree of sophistication and training traditionally not seen in recent small armed attacks the official said
a man claiming to be amedy coulibaly the suspected hostage taker at the paris grocery store told cnn affiliate bfmtv that he belonged to the islamist militant group isis
cnn can not independently confirm the authenticity of the recording
the day's drama began in dammartin en goele where brothers cherif and said kouachi ended up in a print shop in an industrial area
a salesman who identified himself only as didier told france info radio that he shook one of the gunman's hands at about eight thirty a.m. as they arrived at the business
didier said he first thought the man who was dressed in black and heavily armed was a police officer
as he left the armed man said go we don't kill civilians
didier said it wasn't normal
i did not know what was going on
the gunmen told police that they wanted to die as martyrs yves albarello who is in france's parliament said on channel itele
the area meanwhile was locked down with children stuck in schools roads closed and shops shuttered
shortly before five p.m. gunshots and at least three large explosions pierced the relative silence

soon after men could be seen on the roof of the building where the brothers had holed up
four helicopters landed nearby
word came that the brothers were dead and that a man who had been hiding in the building was safe said bernard corneille the mayor of nearby othis
at the same time in a different setting near paris's porte de vincennes about forty kilometers away a similar crisis played out at a kosher store
amedy coulibaly the same man who authorities said is suspected with hayat boumeddiene of killing a policewoman thursday south of paris on friday took a number of hostages there
boumeddiene remains at large
like cherif kouachi a man claiming to be coulibaly called bfmtv on friday
at the scene witnesses heard coulibaly demand freedom for the kouachi brothers according to police union spokesman pascal disand
law enforcement swarmed the area
dozens of schools went on lockdown
a resolution came a few minutes after the dammartin en goele climax in the form of explosions and gunfire
up to twenty heavily armed police officers moved into the store
they came out with a number of civilians
not everyone made it
hollande said four people were killed
israeli government sources told cnn that hollande told netanyahu that four hostages were killed and fifteen were rescued
molins said four hostages were killed by the gunman before police stormed the market
in a speech friday night hollande called the porte de vincennes deaths an anti semitic act
he urged his countrymen not to respond with violence against muslims saying those who committed these acts have nothing to do with the muslim religion
unity he said is our best weapon
that kind of military language is apt when you're talking about two deadly attacks and violent standoffs in a few days
it's something that a man who asked to be called simply teddy understands
he was outside henri dunant elementary school in dammartin en goele on friday hoping to pick up his young son
and eventually the students did leave the school accompanied by police officers who held their hands and in some cases lifted them onto an awaiting bus that would take them to safety
it's like a war teddy said
i don't know how i will explain this to my five year old son
this war erupted two days ago when a pair of heavily armed men hooded and dressed in black entered the paris offices of charlie hebdo the satirical magazine known for its provocative often profane take on religion politics and most anything else
satirical magazine is no stranger to controversy
they burst into a meeting called out individuals and then executed them
the dead included editor and cartoonist stephane charbonnier and four other well known cartoonists known by the pen names
cabu wolinski honore and tignous
authorities followed a lead thursday morning from a gas station attendant near villers cotterets about forty kilometers from dammartin en goele whom cherif kouachi thirty two and said kouachi thirty four reportedly threatened as they stole food and gas
police think the brothers may have later fled on foot into nearby woods
as the suspects moved the french government including more than eighty thousand police deployed across the country also didn't stand still
some of them tried to prevent more bloodshed which might have something to do with nine people detained after the charlie hebdo attacks
investigators also dug to learn about the attackers
who are the suspects 
both men had ties to islamist extremists
said the elder of the kouachi brothers spent several months in yemen in two thousand and eleven receiving weapons training and working with al qaeda in the arabian peninsula according to u.s. officials
his younger brother cherif has a long history of jihad and anti semitism according to documents obtained by cnn
in a four hundred page court record he is described as wanting to go to iraq through syria to go and combat the americans
i was ready to go and die in battle he said in a deposition

i got this idea when i saw the injustices shown by television

a woman in the northwest highlands of scotland who'd fallen ill tested negative for ebola the scottish government said tuesday
a spokesman for the government said the woman had been in west africa recently though she had no direct contact with anyone with ebola
a patient at aberdeen royal infirmary has tested negative for ebola the press release said
the individual was transferred to the hospital by the scottish ambulance service yesterday after falling ill while visiting torridon in the scottish highlands
meanwhile a health care worker who was diagnosed with the ebola virus after returning to scotland from sierra leone was transferred to the royal free hospital in london
the patient is pauline cafferkey thirty nine of glasgow scotland the hospital said
she was working with save the children at an ebola treatment center said michael von bertele humanitarian director at that organization
she traveled via casablanca morocco and london heathrow airport before arriving at glasgow airport on a british airways flight late sunday the health agency nhs scotland said
after feeling unwell she sought medical attention and became the first person to be diagnosed with ebola within the united kingdom
british media outlets said cafferkey is a public health nurse in scotland's south lanarkshire area who was part of a thirty strong team of medical volunteers deployed to west africa by the uk government last month in a joint endeavor with save the children
she was reportedly transferred to london in a military aircraft fitted with an isolation pod
the royal free hospital is equipped with a high level isolation unit with access restricted to specially trained medical staff
a specially designed tent with controlled ventilation is set up over the patient's bed
a british volunteer nurse william pooley was successfully treated in the unit after he was brought home from sierra leone in august having been diagnosed with ebola there
uk authorities are working to trace those who have come into contact with cafferkey
the scottish government has set up a special number for people to call if they traveled on the same london heathrow to glasgow flight as cafferkey
british airways said it was working closely with health authorities in england and scotland and would help with any information needed
the safety and security of our customers and crew is always our top priority and the risk to people on board that individual flight is extremely low the airline said
ebola patients become infectious only after they display symptoms such as fever and vomiting
the deadly virus is spread through contact with bodily fluids
a downing street spokesman told cnn that british prime minister david cameron and scottish first minister nicola sturgeon had discussed the procedures in place to handle such a case
they agreed that both governments would remain in close touch and ensure everything possible was done to support the patient and although the risk to the general population remained low all measures would be taken to protect public health
another suspected ebola case is being tested in southwest england at the royal cornwall hospital health officials said
we do not expect the results to be known for at least twenty four hours and in the meantime the patient is being looked after in isolation following nationally agreed guidelines and protocols to protect the health of our staff and other patients said a joint statement from the hospital and public health england a government agency
according to uk government guidelines humanitarian workers returning from ebola affected countries in west africa who've been at high risk of exposure are expected to monitor their own health for twenty one days after they get home
as of december twenty four at least seven thousand six hundred and ninety three people had died in the current ebola outbreak centered in liberia sierra leone and guinea the world health organization said
there have been at least nineteen thousand six hundred and ninety five cases

it's a long road to recovery for spanish nurse's assistant teresa romero ramos
discharged from hospital six weeks ago after beating ebola she faces life without her beloved dog excalibur put down by spanish authorities for fear he might harbor the deadly virus
and questions remain about how she contracted the virus while helping to care for spanish missionaries brought back from west africa with ebola and the way her own case was handled
romero was in court thursday to seek one hundred and fifty thousand euros in damages from the then madrid health minister she accuses of blaming her for catching the disease
he publicly apologized for the comments and later resigned
she is also taking legal action against regional health authorities over the death of excalibur
speaking to cnn from madrid in her only global tv interview since leaving hospital romero became tearful as she recounted how she learned her adored dog had been put down
due to my serious illness no one was telling me what was happening in the outside world she said
unbeknownst to her locked away in a hospital isolation room animal rights activists had campaigned to prevent the dog's euthanasia with an online petition gathering more than four hundred thousand signatures
but their efforts failed
can pets get or spread ebola 
finally on the day romero received a negative blood test for ebola her husband javier limon broke the news in a phone call to her room
my husband decided to wait in order to tell me about it and to me it was a very sad piece of news totally unexpected
i haven't got words to talk about it she said her emotion obvious
it was probably better not to tell her while she was ill she said but the loss still affects her today
i've forgotten about everything except the death of excalibur not the death itself but the way in which this was done without finding out first whether the dog was infected she said
i think it would've been much wiser to put the dog in quarantine and keep an eye on it rather than to sacrifice the dog like that
this was what happened in the case of texas nurse nina pham whose dog bentley was quarantined while she was treated for ebola
after testing negative for the virus the pet was eventually returned tail wagging to its grateful owner
it was easier for the madrid authorities to have her dog put down romero said but it made what was already a traumatic situation for her far harder
and she still asks herself why it had to be that way
it's a lack of sensitivity a lack of human feelings it's really nasty nasty
everything has been this way but we forget about everything except the death of my dog
the everything romero refers to relates to the way her infection with ebola was first diagnosed and then handled
after she was taken to the alcorcon hospital in madrid by ambulance suffering symptoms including vomiting and a rash she underwent a battery tests
but such was the apparent state of confusion she said that she found out she'd been confirmed as having ebola not from medical staff but by seeing the news story on her cell phone
it is surreal nobody tells you anything and they come and put you inside a bubble and they take you away
and they didn't tell you anything
it is really odd
she said she later found out that the emergency room doctor who first treated her was not informed about her two positive blood tests either
surprising as it is this is how it happened she said
no doctor told me about it nobody told me anything about it nothing
i think that they were going crazy
this took us all aback
cnn is seeking comment from the spanish health ministry over romero's allegation that news that she had tested positive for ebola was given to the press before she found out
it's still not clear how this leak transpired
you think about it 
meanwhile madrid's superior court has already ruled once on the case of excalibur saying that regional health officials did not act recklessly in putting him down
but romero's legal team is planning to take them to court again seeking one hundred and fifty thousand euros compensation for his death
she also wants to see a change in the official protocols for caring for suspected ebola cases so others don't undergo the same ordeal
this could include recording the medical staff as they work so any errors in taking off the protective gear could be spotted and lessons learned according to romero
she says she still does not know how she herself contracted the virus and likely never will
i followed the protocols
i followed the guidelines
i did everything that needs to be done she said
what you are doing is something so serious you are risking your life every time you walk into a room so you think about it
last month the hospital's director general dr. rafael perez santamarina said that through romero's case the hospital had learned many lessons about the treatment of ebola patients and how to protect staff caring for them
romero said she was not yet completely physically recovered from the virus which has killed more than six thousand people in west africa but was slowly getting better
meanwhile her anger and grief over excalibur's fate continues to burn strongly
if i had known about the killing of the dog i would never have volunteered to care for the spanish missionaries she said

forget about william and catherine
the real star of this family is prince george as this year's release of the royals official christmas photographs proves
the three images taken outside with the young prince sitting on a flight of stone steps show the third in line to the throne looking relaxed and sporting a quizzical look and a cheeky grin
over a long sleeve white shirt he wears a knitted navy sweater vest featuring the iconic guardsmen seen outside buckingham palace home to his great grandmother queen elizabeth ii
the pictures taken in late november show prince george in a courtyard at kensington palace where his parents have their official residence in an apartment recently refurbished at a cost of millions of dollars
george is in shorts rather than long pants with knee high socks and shoes
it's a look some may love and others dismiss as rather twee
one of the reasons william and catherine released the pictures was in acknowledgment of the fact that their request for prince george to grow up without intrusion from photography has been and continues to be honored kensington palace said
his parents seized the limelight last week on a three day trip to new york city where they met with celebrities business leaders and political leaders as well as wowing crowds of onlookers
in the course of the whirlwind tour the duke and duchess of cambridge visited the nine eleven memorial and museum chatted with hillary and chelsea clinton at a royal foundation reception and even met jay z beyonce and king james also known as basketball star lebron james at an nba game between the brooklyn nets and james cleveland cavaliers
young george was left at home on this occasion having accompanied his parents on a spring trip to australia and new zealand
but these cute photos should restore the seventeen month old to center stage
catherine is due to give birth to the couple's second child in april next year

the air traffic control system for london airspace has been restored after a technical failure the uk air traffic management company nats said friday but travelers can expect disruptions and flight cancellations
we are in the process of returning to normal operations
we apologize for any delays and the inconvenience this may have caused nats said
it later issued a release saying that it had ruled out a power outage as a cause of the fault which resulted in the temporary closure of london's airspace
travelers passing through london can expect delays or disruption to their flights for hours to come
heathrow airport said the nats systems were now working and stable but about fifty flights had been canceled by five thirty p.m. gmt with the number expected to rise over the evening and into saturday
the earlier problem will cause delays and cancellations to flights for the rest of the day and is likely to have a knock on effect on some services tomorrow because aircraft and crew will now be out of position heathrow said in a statement
passengers due to depart today and tomorrow should check the status of their flight with their airline before traveling to heathrow
we are very sorry for the disruption to passengers journeys
extra staff will be on duty to help passengers it said
luton gatwick and stansted airports which all serve london also warned of delays
hundreds of unclaimed bags sat beside carousels inside terminal 5's baggage claim
a baggage handler told cnn some people grew tired of waiting and left without collecting their bags
carousels were not assigned for some incoming flights
a spokesman for budget airline ryanair robin kiely told cnn that flights were expected to resume with delays but that cancellations were not expected
kiely slammed nats over the problem saying it was unacceptable that its system had dropped for the second time in twelve months particularly on a busy friday in the run up to christmas
paul beauchamp a spokesman for nats said we think there is problem with the flight data system although not exactly sure at this time
he told cnn its systems were not hacked and that idea has been ruled out completely
aviation security expert glenn schoen told cnn the incident had exposed a weakness in the air traffic system a problem that needs to be addressed urgently
we're going to have a major digital forensic effort here i think driven by british authorities maybe with assistance from international aviation authorities to get to the bottom of this as quickly as possible he said
the disconcerting aspect here is the humongous impact of what appears to be one technical error
it doesn't appear like a whole group of people made a mistake or a whole group of systems all had an error at the same time so it tells us somewhere in how the system is configured now there are vulnerabilities we did not know about and apparently have not been accounted for in terms of control measures
british airways offered refunds or the chance to rebook to any of its passengers not wishing to travel friday in light of the problems
we anticipate disruption to both departing and arriving flights but will do all we can to minimize any impact it said in a statement
it's not just uk travelers who will be affected by the glitch
all flights that are supposed to fly london from charles de gaulle are delayed a representative for paris charles de gaulle airport told cnn
flights from tunisia will be landing at charles de gaulle instead of london
mary ryan a spokeswoman for united airlines said none of its inbound flights friday was affected but that four outbound flights were being held at the gate until the issue was resolved
a spokesman for delta air lines advised passengers bound for london on friday to check the status of their flights before traveling
the european air traffic control network eurocontrol earlier said no flights would be accepted in or out of london until seven p.m
the issue affected the air traffic control center in swanwick which controls all air traffic routes in southern england and wales up to approximately manchester
a second air traffic control center at prestwick in scotland takes over air routes from there
it was not affected nats said
cnn's jim boulden said more than eighty airlines fly into and out of heathrow with some two hundred thousand people passing through the airport daily
the system is working fine but it's the aircraft that are in the wrong place it's the aircraft that are delayed he said friday evening
there's a number of planes that have been diverted to other places
they still have to get here to london
schoen the aviation security expert said the resulting effects would be significant
he said they include the parking of the aircraft refueling servicing of the aircraft the security guarding and checking of the aircraft the handling of the passengers at different airports where they're not really planning on that kind of capacity for the coming night perhaps this is happening overseas as well flights that were en route to the united kingdom now diverting to other places
hopefully this will not affect some of the biggest busiest flights
think about you piloting an airbus a three hundred and eighty en route to london and you needing to divert and having to fit that into a schedule of another airport
so these are some major challenges throughout the system that we're hoping and we're assuming authorities not just in the uk but elsewhere as well are ready to handle now
behind the scenes
how a busy airport works

heather cho whose korean name is cho hyun ah resigned tuesday from the airline's catering and in flight sales business and its cabin service and hotel business divisions an airline spokesman said
but she is keeping her title as a vice president of the national carrier he said
as for the next steps the spokesman told cnn there is an investigation going on so we will have to see
the incident occurred friday at new york's jfk airport on a flight due to take off for the south korean city of incheon
cho reportedly demanded that the plane go back to the gate so the crew member who served her macadamia nuts out of a bag rather than on a plate in first class could be kicked off the flight
although her role put her in charge of in flight service she was only a passenger on this flight and was not flying in an official capacity
according to south korean news agency yonhap cho is the eldest daughter of korean air's chairman cho yang ho
he apologized tuesday for any inconvenience caused to passengers and said the incident would be investigated the news agency reported
korean air also issued an apology on heather cho's behalf yonhap reported in which she asked for forgiveness
i will take full responsibility for the incident and step down from my post she is quoted as saying
korean air apologized for any discomfort to those on the flight and said there had been no safety issues involved
the plane arrived at its destination only eleven minutes behind schedule according to yonhap
even though it was not an emergency situation backing up the plane to order an employee to deplane was an excessive act the airline said in a statement
we will re educate all our employees to make sure service within the plane meets high standards
according to her biography on the website of nanyang technological university heather cho joined the airline in one thousand nine hundred and ninety nine and has since been actively involved in establishing a new corporate identity for korean air
she studied at cornell university and the university of southern california
