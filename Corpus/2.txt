the video sixty seven seconds long was released saturday as others before it by isis media wing al furqan media and can not be authenticated by cnn
we are deeply saddened by this despicable and horrendous act of terrorism and we denounce it in the strongest terms japanese prime minister shinzo abe said in tokyo according to broadcaster nhk
to the terrorists we will never never forgive them for this act
he said that japan will continue to provide humanitarian aid to countries affected by the bloody fight against isis
goto's mother junko ishido said he wanted to help create a world without wars
i'm shedding tears of sorrow i just can't think of any words to say
but i don't want this sorrow to create a chain of hatred she said nhk reported
the video opens with a black slate that reads a message to japan
the video then shows a kneeling goto wearing an orange outfit
the man known as jihadi john is standing behind him
the terrorist speaks while holding a knife in his left hand
abe because of your reckless decision to take part in an unwinnable war this knife will not only slaughter kenji but will also carry on and cause carnage wherever your people are found
so let the nightmare for japan begin the man says
the video cuts to black as the militant puts the knife to goto's throat
it then shows the apparent result of the decapitation
it's not clear who conducted the apparent killing
the knife wielding masked man with a london accent nicknamed jihadi john has issued threats and overseen the beheadings of other captives
he has appeared in at least six videos with hostages
the fate of a jordanian pilot captured by isis in syria moath al kasasbeh was unclear
he is not mentioned in the video
isis had been demanding that jordan exchange a convicted terrorist sajida al rishawi for the pilot
if there was no swap isis said it would kill al kaseasbeh first then goto
goto would be the second japanese hostage to be killed by isis recently
a video file posted online a week ago by a known isis supporter shows an image of goto holding a photo of what appeared to be the corpse of his fellow captive haruna yukawa
we stand today in solidarity with prime minister abe and the japanese people in denouncing this barbaric act the president said in a written statement
we applaud japan's steadfast commitment to advancing peace and prosperity in the middle east and globally including its generous assistance for innocent people affected by the conflicts in the region
the forty seven year old goto left japan last fall when his youngest daughter was three weeks old
his wife rinko first heard from his captors december two
jordanian officials have said they are willing to swap al rishawi a female jihadist imprisoned in jordan for her role in a two thousand and five suicide bombing at a wedding reception that killed dozens for the pilot
but jordan's key condition is proof that al kaseasbeh is still alive
al kaseasbeh was captured after he ejected from his f sixteen jet last month near raqqa the extremist group's de facto capital in syria
fahed al kaseasbeh an uncle of the pilot told cnn
i am sad and devastated to hear this news regardless of the nationality of the person
i am sad about this act of the beheading of any human
also i am very worried about the well being of the son of my brother my nephew

a photo of the miami herald correspondent smiling and embracing a woman was featured thursday as part of venezuelan state run television's online tourism campaign
the tagline
we love venezuela
for receiving foreigners like one of our own
an inviting promotion except for the fact that the photo was taken on wyss return to the united states after being detained for forty eight hours by venezuelan authorities two years ago
the image was snapped at miami international airport not at simn bolvar international airport outside the venezuelan capital by miami herald staffer carl juste in november two thousand and thirteen the newspaper said
wyss beaming smile came when he finally arrived on american soil after his detention while reporting about contraband in the border town of san cristobal in the state of tachira
venezuelan authorities at the time said he was detained for failing to have the proper media credentials the miami herald reported friday
but telesur officials apparently believed it was a fitting image to promote tourism in a south american nation where chronic shortages of basic goods had led to protests
the hashtag of the twitter campaign was amamosavenezuela or we love venezuela
on twitter on thursday wyss seemed somewhat amused
irony 
telesurtv has me in promo using pic from when i got out of venezuela after forty eight hr detention
numerous attempts to reach telesur for comment were unsuccessful
the photos of wyss have been taken down

on monday kurdish fighters declared that they had released the city on the border to turkey from isis grip after one hundred and twelve days of fighting
the efforts of the kurdish fighters known as the ypg or people's protection units on the ground were backed by an extensive campaign of airstrikes by the u.s. led international coalition against isis
and according to the interviews given to isis aligned amak news agency in syria it was those airstrikes that won the battle for kobani referred to by the fighters as ayn al islam
recently we have withdrawn from ayn al islam bit by bit because of the airstrikes and deaths of a number of our brothers said one of the two fighters his face covered apart from his eyes
he points to a scene of destruction behind him but vows that isis will persist and this is the message we send to obama
the second fighter interviewed by amak stood near a road sign reading ayn al islam
he said isis forces had raided three hundred and sixty villages around kobani from which the people ran away like rats
but the reason behind their withdrawal from the city he said is that we no longer had places to hold there
we were inside ayn al islam and we occupied more than seventy percents but the airstrikes did not leave any building standing they destroyed everything
his horror of the airstrikes was apparent
i swear by god their planes did not leave the air day and night
they did airstrikes all day and night
they targeted everything
they even attacked motorcycles
they have not left a building standing
but by god willing we will return and we will have our revenge multiplied
isis is on its heels after the loss of kobani and an offensive by kurdish peshmerga armed fighters who protect iraq's kurdish region around mosul iraq's second largest city and a focal point for all sides in the conflict
but on friday the sunni extremist group launched an assault on iraq's oil rich city of kirkuk in what may be an attempt to divert kurdish troops from mosul
a report by rudaw a private website dedicated to presenting news from a kurdish perspective said at least thirty isis fighters were killed in the assault and fifteen captured
casualties on the other side included brig
gen. shirko fateh the highest ranking operational commander of the peshmerga brigade located in kirkuk
isis captured fifteen employees working at the khabbaz oilfield southwest of kirkuk after launching their assault in the area brig
gen. sarhat qader the head of kirkuk's suburbs and villages police told cnn on saturday
a joint operation is underway by his police officers peshmerga and kurdish security forces to free the hostages and take back control of the oilfield seized by isis militants on friday qader said
troops have already liberated al assal village also taken by isis on friday and located next to khabbaz oil field he said
meanwhile gen. hussein mansour the head of peshmerga forces in jalawla in diyala province was killed in clashes with isis in southwestern kirkuk saman jabari a senior kurdish figure and local peshmerga leader told cnn on saturday
mansour brought his troops from jalawla about one hundred miles away to reinforce the peshmerga in kirkuk following the isis assault he said
u.s. and coalition aircraft carried out seventeen airstrikes in iraq on friday according to a u.s. central command statement ten of them near kirkuk and two near mosul
both the coalition and the peshmerga are trying to prevent isis from opening a new front in kirkuk which isis likely hoped would lessen the pressure on mosul
additionally by going on the offensive here isis appears to be offering some obvious targets for strikes
if isis can be driven back from positions in kirkuk it will have to try other tactical offensives to draw kurdish forces away from the outskirts of mosul
the kurds on their own admission have no intention of entering mosul but want to choke off isis supply lines into the city
another ten airstrikes were carried out friday against isis targets in syria eight of them near kobani
according to the syrian observatory for human rights a london based opposition group from october six to monday the fighting for kobani killed nine hundred and seventy nine isis combatants three hundred and twenty four ypg fighters and twelve rebels backing the ypg
thirty eight more isis militants died in attacks using booby trapped vehicles or bomb belts and the isis shelling of kobani killed twelve civilians sohr said
on the other hand hundreds of militants died during u.s. and arab allies airstrikes on the city and its countryside the group said
however the success of the coalition airstrikes in kobani will be hard to replicate elsewhere
there are almost no civilians left in the city of kobani and most residents left early on when the fighting started especially in the contested areas close to the front line
this meant airstrikes were fairly straightforward with the coalition able to target one side and avoid civilian casualties
the front line was well defined so it was clear where the isis and kurdish fighters were
a more challenging situation is when airstrikes seek to target isis inside populated areas like mosul in iraq raqqa in syria and other cities under isis control
here the effectiveness of airstrikes is limited because of the risk of casualties among civilians
when coalition airstrikes hit cities in aleppo in northern syria civilian deaths were reported last year

but in the isolated town of sandino cuba's first catholic church since the one thousand nine hundred and fifty nine revolution took power is set to be built
there is money to start there is the construction material to start there are the permissions to start so everything is ready said bishop jorge enrique serpa prez who oversees the diocese where the new church will be built
the sandino church has been fifty six years in the making ever since fidel castro took power and cuba became an officially atheist state
religious people fell under suspicion by the new revolutionary government but none more so than those who belonged to the catholic church which was seen as being overly sympathetic to the batista regime that castro had driven from power
in the first years of the revolution thousands of catholic priests were jailed or forced into exile and church property including the jesuit school that castro attended was seized by the cuban government
only with the visit in one thousand nine hundred and ninety eight of pope john paul ii to the island did relations between the cuban government and catholic church begin to thaw
christmas again became a national holiday and cubans faced less official discrimination for practicing their faiths
in december cuban president raul castro thanked pope francis for his role in the secret talks that led to a prisoner swap between cuba and the united states and the start of negotiations to restore full diplomatic relations
in two thousand and fifteen church officials said requests to build new churches that had long been ensnared in red tape began to receive government approval
while church officials said several new catholic houses of worship are in the works the first will be built in sandino a remote town at the end of a pothole cratered road in cuba's westernmost province
the rev
cirilo castro drives that road to sandino once a week to officiate mass in a converted garage in the back of a house the church rents
he has lost count of the miles he has put on his green russian lada as part of his ministry to towns throughout the province
when the new catholic church is built the first in sandino's history castro said he would move to minster there full time
i hope the church doesn't stay within the four walls he said that it will go farther than that
that with the building of the new church there will be more people of faith castro said
the cuban catholic church desperately needs more followers in cuba where in recent years the syncretic religion santeria that mixes african religions with catholicism has exploded in popularity
the church in sandino will take about two years to build and when completed will hold two hundred people castro said
most of the fifty thousand dollar collected so far for the new church comes from fund raisers held by the st. lawrence catholic church in tampa florida
much of tampa's history and culture comes from cuba said the rev
tom morgan st. lawrence's vicar
it's absolutely fantastic they are building a new church and i hope to be able to visit one day
morgan said he was optimistic that recent changes in u.s treasury department regulations would make it possible for his church to send supplies and building materials to cuba to help with the construction of the new church
as she makes her way down a path to attend mass in cirilo castro's converted garage digna martinez said she has waited more than five decades for a church to be built in sandino
martinez said she her husband and two children were those relocated to the town during early one thousand nine hundred and sixty s when a triumphant fidel castro was still battling what he called bandits holdouts against his revolution waging guerrilla warfare in the countryside
while there is no official tally hundreds perhaps thousands of people suspected of plotting against the revolution were shipped to sandino to live in a form of internal exile
it was a process to make a community for political prisoners martinez said
they took our farm away and brought us here
a lifelong catholic martinez said one of the most devastating things about being forced to move five hundred miles away from her home to a town she had never heard of was that there was no church
having a church is very important she said
many of the people here were brought up catholic and need a church
we were baptized and prayed when we went to bed and woke up just like our parents and grandparents taught us


the long skeleton was found in two thousand and six by farmers digging for a fish pond in qijiang city in the southwestern chongqing province
lida xing a member of the research team from the university of alberta who made the discovery told cnn it was named qijianglong the dragon of qijiang because farmers thought the bones resembled the shape of chinese mythical dragons
we found the dinosaur's huge vertebrae with the skull and the tail but couldn't find any bones from the hands or the legs
so the locals began to say the long body looked just like a dragon from ancient chinese stories said xing
the findings published earlier this week in the journal of vertebrate paleontology show that the new species belongs to a group of dinosaurs called mamenchisaurids known for their extremely long necks which would measure up to half their body length
most sauropods or long necked dinosaurs such as those depicted in the popular animated series the land before time have necks that span only one third of their body length
qijianglong is a cool animal
if you imagine a big animal that is half neck you can see that evolution can do quite extraordinary things tetsuto miyashita a phd student at the university of alberta said in a press release
the dinosaur is the youngest addition to the mamenchisaurid group which is only found in asia
the discovery suggests that there may be other species of long necks within the genus from different continents
qijianglong shows that long necked dinosaurs diversified in unique ways in asia during jurassic times something very special was going on in that continent said miyashita
nowhere else we can find dinosaurs with longer necks than those in china
the new dinosaur tells us that these extreme species thrived in isolation from the rest of the world
the skeleton is now housed in a museum in qijiang but will be moved to a new dinosaur museum in the city that is currently being built
how much do you really know about dinosaurs 







three of the prisoners isis apparently wants back are women a failed suicide bomber an alleged bomb maker and a woman tied to the head of isis
the fourth is a child
many countries have a strategy of not negotiating with terrorists
but this new approach by isis is putting governments to the test
in its most recent demand isis called for sajida al rishawi to be handed over
she is a female jihadi imprisoned for her role in a two thousand and five suicide bombing at a wedding reception in jordan that killed dozens
if she wasn't brought to the turkish border by sunset thursday the militants said two hostages would die
japanese journalist kenji goto and jordanian pilot moaz al kassasbeh
the deadline has passed but the hostages fate is unknown
by negotiating with isis by recognizing them by even having dialogue with them it gives them the impression of acting as a state said sajjan gohel international security director at the asia pacific foundation
jordanian officials have said they are willing to swap al rishawi for the pilot
but they have demanded proof of life to demonstrate that al kassasbeh captured in december after his fighter jet crashed in syria is still alive
former fbi negotiator chris voss said jordan was absolutely right to do so and that the failure of isis so far to provide proof of life was suspicious
it's just a natural and ordinary course of bargains in these types of negotiations and they are choosing not to do that at this point he said
the latest proposal by isis is not a prisoner exchange in the usual sense since the militants now want the release of al rishawi just in order not to kill the two hostages rather than promising their release
voss said entering into this kind of territory with terrorists was dangerous
if you engage in that sort of bargain then they can threaten to kill the same person over and over and over again and continue to demand release of hostages or whatever their demands are he said
you can't give in to that sort of thing because then it puts you in an endless loop where they have all the power
it's important to remember that for isis and groups like them the key factor is gain voss said
kidnappers are in a commodities exchange business
while it's a horrifying concept to us to them it's business and it's the business isis is in and so you have to treat it like that
besides failed suicide bomber al rishawi isis wants two other women an alleged bomb maker and a woman tied to the head of isis and a child
each of the prisoners is symbolically and strategically important for the terror group
al rishawi is connected to isis through her brother once a ranking member of al qaeda in iraq which spawned isis
in exchange for american journalists james foley and later steven sotloff isis demanded the release of aafia siddiqui nicknamed lady al qaeda an imprisoned neuroscientist in the united states linked to nine eleven mastermind khalid sheikh mohammed
she was arrested in afghanistan in two thousand and eight carrying bomb making documents for a mass casualty chemical and biological weapons attack against american targets including the statue of liberty and the brooklyn bridge
one high profile prisoner who isis has not yet publicly demanded is saja al dulaimi
she may be the wife of shadowy isis leader abu bakr al baghdadi who fought with al qaeda in iraq though the iraqi interior ministry has disputed that
regional sources have told cnn that al dulaimi is herself a powerful isis figure arrested as a high value target as she crossed into lebanon with a four year old child whom one intelligence source identified as baghdadi's son
since their capture in march two thousand and fourteen baghdadi has been calling to get his child released a regional source said
in the past in similar cases governments have budged
last year the united states traded several taliban captives for sergeant bowe bergdahl who was captured by the extremist group almost five years earlier
despite claims that bergdahl may have abandoned his post before being kidnapped the state department defended the move saying it was nothing unusual
it is consistent absolutely with what's happened in previous wars including korea including vietnam said state department spokeswoman marie harf adding that there was a long history in the united states of prisoner swaps
complicating the debate one of the five taliban detainees released from guantanamo bay in return for bergdahl last may has attempted to return to militant activity from his current location in qatar by making contact with suspected taliban associates in afghanistan multiple officials told cnn on thursday
during the cold war the west also swapped hundreds of spies with communist bloc countries
in two thousand and eleven israel made a major made a major concession to its arch enemy the palestinian militant group hamas which runs gaza
it exchanged more than one thousand palestinian prisoners in return for the soldier gilad shalit who had been kidnapped in gaza in two thousand and six
hamas celebrated the deal as a major victory and the government of prime minister benjamin netanyahu was heavily criticized
duncan bullivant a uk based risk consultant says swapping prisoners for hostages is still better than paying for release of prisoners as some european countries do
the payment of cash ransom can been seen as the direct funding of terrorist organizations and for that reason and a few others is regarded as unacceptable certainly by the u.s. uk and increasingly other nations he said
there would be nothing unusual about the swapping of combatants and if the japanese victim is thrown in as part of the deal then that is a great bonus
it's sadly far from certain that goto and al kassasbeh will emerge from the current negotiations alive
but whether they gain the release of al rishawi or not isis leaders have very clearly achieved one goal
maximum media coverage for their cause

for months isis has been facing off with the peshmerga armed fighters who protect iraqi kurdistan to the west of kirkuk
it had gone into areas on kirkuk's outskirts but not the central city
heavily armed militants attacked an abandoned hotel in central kirkuk that local police had used as their headquarters
peshmerga and kurdish anti terror units later raided the hotel wresting control of it from the militants and killing three of them according to peshmerga sources
in addition two suicide bombers detonated themselves in an attempt to keep the kurdish forces out
also friday isis militants took over maktab khalid an area about twelve miles southwest of kirkuk after heavy clashes with the peshmerga
among those killed was brig
gen. shirko fateh the highest ranking operational commander of the peshmerga brigade located in kirkuk
photos posted by isis purportedly show the group's militants in control of parts of south and southwest kirkuk burning tents that had been used by peshmerga troops
the u.s. military said friday that an isis chemical weapons expert was killed during a coalition strike late last week
abu malik worked in saddam hussein's chemical weapons program before joining al qaeda in two thousand and five u.s. central command said
he was killed january twenty four near mosul
his death is expected to temporarily degrade and disrupt the terrorist network and diminish ability to potentially produce and use chemical weapons against innocent people the military said
there is no public evidence that isis has a dedicated weapons of mass destruction program
but u.s. central command said
his past training and experience provided the terrorist group with expertise to pursue a chemical weapons capability
kirkuk is a strategically important city in the months long fight one that has pitted isis against the peshmerga iraqi government troops and an international coalition that has carried out airstrikes against the terrorist group
it is one of the few notable cities apart from the region of kurdistan and its capital irbil in northern iraq that haven't fallen to isis
part of its significance stems from the fact its oil reserves are almost as much as those in southern iraq
the kurds and the central iraqi government in baghdad have long wrangled over control of those reserves with each side wanting to keep hold of them
isis which relies heavily on revenue from oil smuggling to fund its operations has been coveting them too
peshmerga forces took over the kirkuk area in june when the iraqi army crumbled in the face of isis advances and have played a vital role in defending it from isis since
in december isis claimed responsibility for a suicide car bomb attack there that killed at least seventeen people and injured more than twenty
the attack according to isis was meant to send a message to the kurdish people and peshmerga fighters
still kirkuk is hardly the only place that has seen recent fighting which may be part of isis rationale for friday's attack there
the group has been fending off an offensive from peshmerga fighters around mosul iraq's second largest city and a focal point for all sides in the conflict that has left the sunni extremist group on its heels
the city of one point five million people on the tigris river has been held by isis since june
isis has invested heavily in governing the city
its leader abu bakr al baghdadi pronounced his leadership of the caliphate at the grand mosque there in july
kurdish officials say that as long as isis holds mosul it threatens kurdistan
likewise neither the government in baghdad nor its coalition partners can rest while terrorists occupy iraq's second largest city
peshmerga forces have made steady progress against isis north and west of mosul over the past two months
they have taken some three thousand square kilometers of the sinjar area as well as the area around the mosul dam choking off access routes and threatening isis main resupply routes
there's little doubt though that isis remains a very real force and threat in much of iraq
the group which calls itself the islamic state still controls a vast swath of that middle eastern nation and neighboring syria
its goal is to have a vast caliphate under its strict version of sharia law with its followers proving they will stop at nothing having been blamed for the large scale killings of civilians mass kidnappings and forcing women and girls to become sex slaves during its quest
that violent campaign continued friday and not just in kirkuk
dozens of gunmen believed to be from isis faced off friday morning about one hundred and seventy five miles away in central ramadi police and health officials in that city said
several hours later that onslaught had been foiled and twenty gunmen were dead according to the officials
elsewhere in ramadi a suicide car bomb explosion at an iraqi army checkpoint killed one soldier and wounded six others
violence flared in other parts of iraq as well that while it hasn't been tied to isis is further proof of the country's unsettled state
six explosions went off friday around baghdad leaving at least seven dead and twenty three wounded according to police officials
the deadliest such blast was in bab al sharji a busy commercial area in central baghdad leaving three dead and ten hurt

now would you two care for a date 
that was possible some fifty five thousand years ago in modern day israel archaeologists announced this week a find that they say could be significant since it could shed light on when and how our modern day ancestors moved from africa into europe and asia
it's all based on the discovery of portions of a skull in manot cave in western galilee detailed in a study published wednesday in nature
the specimen is unequivocally modern and is similar in shape to recent african skulls as well as to european skulls according to the report from a team of researchers from the university of tel aviv ben gurion university israel antiquities authority and elsewhere
it's amazing co author israel hershkovitz told the guardian explaining how the skull was found on the rocky shelf of a cave that collapsed thirty thousand years ago and was revealed in two thousand and eight
this is the first specimen we have that connects africa to europe
why is that time frame significant 
for one thing many scientists believe modern humans left africa for points north forty thousand to sixty thousand years ago
the nature study suggests it was closer to the older date and that they might have gone through the modern day middle east
according to the report an analysis of the skull indicates that the manot people could be closely related to the first modern humans who later successfully colonized europe
in other words the first modern day europeans thought to have arrived on that continent around forty five thousand years ago may have stopped in israel first
but it's not like they were all alone then among hominids the blanket term for erect primates from chimpanzees to homo sapiens in either place
around that time what's known as the upper paleolithic period or late stone age there were neanderthals both in europe and in what's now israel
the nature study claims the manot find represents the only modern human specimen to provide evidence that during the middle and upper paleolithic interface both modern humans and neanderthals concurrently inhabited the southern levant
this all was happening around the time of likely interbreeding
with the neanderthals meaning the two groups of hominids could have gotten together and reproduced
without dna tests it's impossible to say if the adult whose skull was found was a pure descendant of the modern humans who came from africa or had a bit of neanderthal ancestry mixed in
but it definitely could have happened
or just as possible that person or some immediate ancestors could have reproduced with neanderthals
manot is the best candidate for the interbreeding of modern humans with neanderthals hershkovitz told the guardian
there really is no other candidate
the discovery was generally greeted warmly by experts though with some hints of caution
this was only one specimen after all so there may be others out there that could be even more informative
and it was only part of a skull
chris stringer of london's natural history museum tweeted that he agrees with skeptics that interbreeding could have happened elsewhere in asia
also skull lacks the most informative areas
yet in comments to discovery news stringer also acknowledged that manot might represent some of the elusive first migrants in the hypothesized out of africa event about sixty thousand years ago a population whose descendants ultimately spread right across asia and also into europe
stringer said it is the first modern human from western asia that is well dated to the estimated time frame of interbreeding between early modern humans and neanderthals

at least thirty six people were wounded in the assaults which involved car bombs and mortar rounds in the town of al arish in north sinai the sources told the egyptian website
the army is battling an islamist insurgency in north sinai that has spiked since the two thousand and thirteen ouster of islamist president mohamed morsy
suspected militants carried out consecutive attacks on the headquarters of the north sinai security directorate in al arish a nearby army base a hotel and several security checkpoints state tv and the ahram arabic news website reported
blasts cracked walls and shattered windows of surrounding buildings
troops combed the area in search of suspects
the country's most active jihadist group ansar beit al maqdis said via twitter that it was behind the assaults
in november the sinai based group pledged allegiance to isis which has seized swaths of syria and iraq
the office of flagship newspaper ahram in al arish located near the targeted police building was slightly damaged in the attack office head ahmed selim said
the building was vacant at the time because of a dusk to dawn curfew imposed in north sinai late in october after deadly militant attacks that killed thirty one soldiers earlier in the month in what was considered the worst violence on egyptian troops in recent times
one army member was killed and another wounded in a separate attack on a security checkpoint in the north sinai border town of rafah
the military said the violence came in response to the successful security campaign against militants in the restive province
the statement did not include a death or injury toll
egypt's army has struggled to crush the militant insurgency in the peninsula which at times has expanded to mainland cities including cairo
militants have mainly targeted police and troops killing hundreds in the last eighteen months
ansar beit al maqdis has claimed responsibility for some of the deadliest attacks
the violence has prompted the army to demolish houses and clear residents in rafah in an attempt to establish to a buffer zone aimed at deterring militant infiltration and arms smuggling

a gas explosion rocked a maternity hospital on the outskirts of mexico city on thursday january twenty nine

two russian bombers caused disruption to civil aviation when they flew near but did not cross into british airspace on wednesday the foreign office representative said
two uk royal air force jets intercepted the bombers both capable of carrying nuclear weapons south of bournemouth england over the english channel a uk defense spokesman said thursday
the british jets escorted the bombers for about an hour and a half until the bombers left the area the defense spokesman said
russian aircraft maneuvers yesterday are part of increasing pattern of out of area operations by russian aircraft the foreign office representative said
the representative did not elaborate on how civil aviation was disrupted
details about what the russian ambassador has told britain about the incident weren't immediately available
wednesday's incident would be the latest in what nato has said is an increase in russian military flights near alliance members territory
in november nato said its members jets had been scrambled more than four hundred times in two thousand and fourteen to intercept russian military flights close to members territories a fifty percents increase over the previous year
the increase harkens back to the days of the cold war nato secretary general jens stoltenberg said november twenty during a visit to nato member estonia
this pattern is risky and unjustified stoltenberg said
so nato remains vigilant
we are here
and we are ready to defend all allies against any threat
in a november report the european leadership network listed more than forty close military encounters between russia and the west in the eight months from march to october
three of those including a near collision between a russian military plane and a swedish passenger aircraft carrying one hundred and thirty two people were classified as high risk incidents that could have led to direct military confrontation between russia and the west according to the report titled dangerous brinksmanship
uk jets intercepted more than one hundred russian aircraft last year according to the british defense ministry

rome's jewish community spokesman fabio perugia said on twitter that he and the head of rome's jewish community riccardo pacifici had been filming with a tv crew from italy's canale five following a ceremony tuesday to mark seventy years since the camp's liberation
the crew had finished their work at eleven p.m. and the group tried to leave he said
but group members found they were locked in the camp in subzero temperatures with no security guards in sight
riccardo pacifici then pushed through a window that was in the ticket sales building and the window opened up perugia said
he entered and then opened the door for us
at that point the alarm went off
and we thought good finally someone from security will come to let us out 
however at this point their night got worse perugia said
the security guard arrived indeed but instead of letting us go they kept us there
for hours and hours and hours
they started to interrogate us and they treated us like real criminals he said
perugia said the guards were inflexible and insisted on following procedure
eventually they took the party to the auschwitz police station he said where they were kept until five thirty a.m. and questioned one by one
they don't know how to distinguish between the real criminals and those who were there simply to do an interview and honor the day of memory he said
the incident ended with the party writing down their version of events perugia said adding that they had asked for the matter to be looked into through italian diplomatic channels
a spokesman for the auschwitz museum gave cnn a different account of the evening's events however
pawel sawicki said the italian tv crew had permission to film at the site until eleven point three zero p.m. when they had agreed that they would exit and security guards would come to the gate to let them out
he said cctv footage shows they finished early and went to the gate a few minutes past eleven p.m. rather than waiting for the security guards to come at the agreed time one of them broke into the visitor center and let others in too he said
this triggered an alarm so the security guards came to the building which houses cash registers and an atm
according to protocol they asked the men to show id but they refused to do so sawicki said
the police had to be called since they can only demand that people show id documents he said
the police then arrived and took over the matter he said
while being on the site we have to follow the rules sawicki said
so until the unfortunate incident everything was ok because they had our permission they cooperated with our security and they had the time that they declared they would be leaving
he said the group could also have gone to another exit one hundred and fifty meters away where the security guards were based if they wanted to leave earlier and could then have been let out of that gate
however they decided to act outside the regulations and triggered the security alarm and triggered the whole reaction and then refused to cooperate
auschwitz is a priceless heritage place he said
it must be protected and there must be security

more than one hundred people were inside cuajimalpa maternal hospital when the blast occurred at about seven a.m. minutes after a hose burst on a truck supplying gas to the building
paramedics carried bloodied victims on stretchers
ivonne lugo durantes told cnnmexico she spent ten minutes trapped under rubble before rescuers reached her
the supervising nurse called her husband mario angeles sanchez after the blast
as she described what was happening he heard people in the background screaming for help
i am still a little bit in shock
it was a nightmare she said describing how hospital workers tried to rescue babies from a nursery as flames engulfed the building
a nurse and two babies were killed by the blast mexico city health secretary armando ahued told cnn affiliate forotv
at least seventy three people were injured he said including about twenty newborns
officials initially reported a higher death toll but later said a mix up between the number of those deceased and those seriously injured led to an incorrect report
outside the hospital frantic family members searched for word of loved ones they feared were inside
searching continued thursday evening at the site though officials said it appeared everyone had been accounted for
jose eduardo was relieved to learn his wife and son who was born on wednesday had survived the blast
he heard about the explosion on the news from his home where he'd gone to rest after the baby was born
he rushed to the hospital to be by his wife's side
she told me that it started to smell like gas and the ceiling started to fall on everyone he told cnnmexico
she covered up the baby and ran
his wife was barefoot when she escaped he said
others were naked
we started pulling babies from the debris who were alive ignacio a volunteer at the scene told cnn
we pulled out fortunately i think we pulled out seven
we would've wanted to pull out more
witnesses said the explosion shook the neighborhood
we heard something and it smelled so much like gas really a lot
and then two minutes three seconds later we saw an explosion that made everything fly in the air witness teresa ramirez told cnnmexico
it threw me to the ground
virginia gonzalez who lives near the hospital said her patio was covered with broken glass from blown out windows
after the explosion mexicans eager to help lined up at hospitals where victims were being treated offering to donate blood and bringing bottled water and diapers for survivors
lugo the nurse who was inside the hospital during the explosion told cnnmexico she is suffering from first degree burns but feels lucky to be alive
i feel grateful to have another chance to keep living she said to keep working as a nurse
first calls came into firefighters reporting a gas leak at the hospital a facility on the southwest outskirts of mexico city that is part of the government health system
hospital workers had already started evacuating the building when the explosion happened minutes later mayor miguel angel mancera told reporters
one of the city's publicly accessible webcams captured the blast showing a plume of smoke rising from the direction of the hospital
a truck was supplying gas to the hospital when apparently a hose burst and the resulting leak caused an explosion mancera said
the driver and two assistants delivering the gas have been detained mancera's office told cnnmexico
two of the detained workers are hospitalized and one is receiving other medical care the office said
the gas in question is known as liquefied petroleum gas a mix that could be mostly propane or mostly butane
these propane butane mixes are commonly used in mexico for heating cooking and other fuel applications
gas express nieto the company that owned the truck has operated in mexico city since two thousand and seven and has a contract to supply gas to hospitals run by the mexico city government the mayor said
the hospital is seventy percents collapsed mancera said although some walls and steel columns are still standing

yet in his mind he had to go into war torn syria
the experienced journalist explained why in a video shot in october from southern turkey
he felt compelled to tell the stories of war in all its trauma complexity and humanity
syrian people suffering for three years and a half
it's enough the forty seven year old goto explained
so i would like to get the story of what isis wants to do
so goto crossed the border into syria and headed toward the islamist extremist group's de facto capital of raqaa despite the advice of friend alaaeddin al zaim who'd been with him previously in that nation
al zaim recalled telling goto it's not safe for you
the journalist replied that he didn't feel he was in danger
after all his native japan unlike the iraqi government and the international coalition supporting it wasn't involved in the military fight against the terrorist group that's branded itself as the islamic state
i am not american
i am not british
i am japanese goto said according to al zaim i can go
it appears to have been a mistake
a new isis video released saturday appeared to show the decapitated body of goto
while the authenticity of the video could not immediately be established by cnn japanese officials did not challenge news of his apparent death
we are deeply saddened by this despicable and horrendous act of terrorism and we denounce it in the strongest terms prime minister shinzo abe said in tokyo
goto covered big news stories for years hoping that by telling them he could make a difference in the world
his work was featured by numerous japanese organizations including broadcaster nhk
and he wasn't afraid to put himself in harm's way to tell a story
one need just look to his previous trip to syria where a bloody complicated civil war has gone on for four years
the united nations estimated in august that nearly two hundred thousand had been killed more than three million syrians had become refugees and at least six point five million were displaced inside the country
while there goto came to know another japanese man a forty two year old aspiring security contractor haruna yukawa
according to yukawa's friend nobuo kimoto goto passed along insights on how to survive in syria and introduced him to rebel fighters who are distinct from isis though both are fighting syrian president bashar al assad's forces
the fact the two japanese men's paths had crossed again became public january twenty in an isis video posted to social media
it shows goto and yukawa dressed in orange kneeling in front of a masked black clad man
in it the isis militant gives the japanese government a choice to pay two hundred million dollar the same amount of money prime minister shinzo abe recently pledged for those contending with isis to free the japanese men within seventy two hours
days later a new message was posted by known isis supporters featuring the voice of someone claiming to be goto
yukawa apparently was dead
and so soon would goto the new message claimed unless jordan's government freed its longtime prisoner sajida al rishawi a convicted terrorist
on saturday the latest isis video showed the masked man blaming japan's humanitarian support of coalition efforts in iraq and syria for goto's apparent beheading
japan's government insisted it did everything within reason that it could to bring goto home safely
the fate of moath al kasasbeh a jordanian pilot recently captured by isis while on a military mission targeting the islamist extremist group is unclear
he was not shown or mentioned in the video
speaking out for the first time thursday goto's wife rinko said her husband was taken from me october twenty five although she didn't know it until a december two message from his captors landed in her inbox
now after working tirelessly behind the scenes she went public to beg the jordanian and japanese governments to understand that the fates of both are in their hands
her statement comes after she got another email wednesday with the hostage takers final demand
our baby girl was only three weeks old when kenji left
i hope our oldest daughter who is just two will get to see her father again rinko said on thursday
i want them both to grow up knowing their father
as to why goto left in the first place his wife said my husband is a good and honest man who went to syria to show the plight of those who suffer
i believe that kenji may have also been trying to find out about haruna yukawa's situation

i know all too well what are going through
the japanese captive's mother junko ishido had spoken out previously trying to save a man she insists is not the enemy of isis
while goto's decision to go to syria surprised his mother his rationale did not
ishido said kenji always has been a kind person ever since he was little
he was always saying i want to save the lives of children in war zones 
and now goto has become a victim in a war a fact that's tearing ishido apart
i'm shedding tears of sorrow i just can't think of any words to say but i don't want this sorrow to create a chain of hatred she said saturday
kenji worked for children who suffered from conflicts and poverty and his goal was to create a society without war
i want to pass on his thoughts to people around the world
who is jordanian pilot moath al kasasbeh captured by isis 


the revelations which came in the opening day of an inquest into the sixteen hour siege of a central sydney cafe are likely to further fuel questions about how new south wales police responded to the december fifteen incident especially their choice of weapons
of the five shots fired by man haron monis a self styled muslim cleric who took eighteen people hostage only one found a target counsel assisting the coroner jeremy gormly told the inquest
monis shot and killed cafe manager tori johnson execution style prompting police to storm the cafe in the early hours of december sixteen gormly said
victims of sydney siege
a mother of three and a beloved son
all the injuries that followed two fatal including those to monis and four non fatal were caused by police fire according to the evidence
the inquest is expected to examine whether the deaths of johnson the cafe's thirty four year old manager and katrina dawson a thirty eight year old lawyer could have been prevented
addressing those at the hearing which was closed to the public but open to hostages and victims families gormly outlined the events that led to the deaths of johnson dawson and the gunman
he said the first killing of johnson occurred at about two point one four a.m. shortly after a group of hostages fled the cafe
gormly described an execution style killing in which monis ordered johnson to kneel then simply shot him without further notice or warning in the back of the head
the end of the barrel was about seventy five centimeters from mr johnson's head at the moment of discharge he said
mr johnson is believed to have died immediately
the killing was witnessed by a police marksman resulting in an immediate order to force entry he said
police then shot out the glass doors and windows threw in eleven distractors producing flashes and bangs and two armed tactical response officers entered firing twenty two shots
at least two police bullets or bullet fragments struck monis in the head and eleven other police bullets or fragments hit his body killing him instantly said gormly
but their rounds ricocheted off the hard surfaces in the cafe killing dawson and injuring three other hostages and one of the response team who was struck in the face
ms dawson was struck by six fragments of a police bullet or bullets he said
gormly said the siege began after monis entered the lindt cafe at about eight point three three a.m. carrying a large backpack and a plastic bag containing a sawn off shotgun and ordered chocolate cake and tea
he moved to a table with a clear view of the cafe then after about thirty minutes asked to speak with the manager
staff noticed that johnson's body language appeared tense
he called on an employee to fetch his keys lock the doors and remain calm
monis then stood up produced a shotgun and announced that he had a bomb before ordering hostages to hold up an islamic flag
he then ordered johnson to make an emergency call to authorities announcing that it was a terrorist attack and that there were bombs elsewhere
police arrived at the scene shortly after
several investigations into what occurred over the two days of the siege are underway including what information security agencies had on monis and how the police handled the crisis
lawyers representing dawson johnson and the police force will appear at the inquest as well as lawyers representing two tactical response officers
johnson's family members were in attendance as well as john o'brien one of the first hostages to escape





the unlikely find could be nearly two hundred thousand years old and suggests a fourth type of ancient human who lived in asia long before homo sapiens ever came to be
three other known archaic asian hominids include homo erectus found in java and china
the shorter homo floresiensis from indonesia
and neanderthals in the russian altai mountains
scientists believe that human jaws and teeth became smaller as they evolved
but unlike other fossils of the time the newly discovered jawbone is thick with large molars suggesting the existence of a different group
the new taiwan mandible is clearly different than the known homo erectus populations from northern china and java and likely represents a group that has been unrecognized so far researcher dr. yousuke kaifu told cnn
it's only one piece but the significance is huge
researchers from taiwan and japan named the ancient human penghu one after the penghu channel where the fossil was found
the team spent five years analyzing the bone which was difficult to date because it had been recovered from the sea
the findings reminded me that our knowledge is always very limited and we have very limited fossil records said kaifu
that's a great lesson for me

in another the cleanshaven young man in uniform appears deadly serious as one might expect from a fighter pilot whose airstrikes demand precision
behind his military postures was a devout muslim who memorized the quran and hailed from a large family and prominent tribe noted for its loyalty to the monarchy
al kasasbeh's fate had been a mystery since last december when his aircraft crashed during a mission and he was reportedly captured by isis in syria
that mystery ended tuesday when video and images purportedly by isis show the pilot suffered a horrible death
footage and images released by the islamist militants depict the pilot in a cage being burned alive
jordanian state tv confirmed his death but cnn could not immediately verify the authenticity of the tape
the pilot's father safi al kasasbeh described his son as an unassuming muslim
the father made those remarks well before his son's death was disclosed
at the time of the capture safi al kasasbeh told the jordan times that his son was a very modest and religious person who memorized the muslim holy book and was never harmful to anyone
the twenty seven year old pilot was a lieutenant according to the jordan times an english language newspaper published daily in the kingdom
one of eight children moath al kasasbeh came from karak governorate in jordan and graduated from king hussein air college the newspaper said
prior to the announcement of his death a message purportedly from isis had presented an ultimatum to jordan
bring convicted terrorist sajida al rishawi to the turkish border by sunset january twenty nine or the pilot will die
tied to his fate was that of japanese hostage kenji goto whose apparent beheading was shown in a video released by isis militants over the weekend
jordan had said it was ready to release al rishawi if al kasasbeh were to be released unharmed
reeling with shock at how the pilot was murdered jordanian officials were said to be considering a military response to isis's claims
king abdullah condemned the killing and said that the brave pilot was killed in defense of his religion his country and his nation
it is the duty of the sons and daughters of jordan to stand together and show the mettle of the jordanian people in unity determination and resolve the king said
a jordanian official said the pilot was actually killed a month ago in early january
the purported immolation is a macabre closure to al kasasbeh's life
while he was still considered missing the family's desperation grew as time passed and as al kasasbeh's fate was linked to that of goto and the release of al rishawi
goto appeared to hold a picture of the pilot now bearded in a video message purported to be from isis that was released in january
on the same day safi al kasasbeh joined hundreds of fellow jordanians at a solidarity protest held in the capital amman where he called on the jordanian authorities to act to secure his son's release
i firmly ask whomever has sent moath to fight outside the borders of jordan on a mission unrelated to us to make strong efforts to bring back moath he said
moath's blood is precious
it's precious and it represents the blood of all jordanians he said
the plight of moath al kasasbeh resonated with king abdullah who has been a pillar of the international effort against isis and is himself a former helicopter pilot
the young captive hailed from a high ranking tribe considered especially loyal to the royal family
abdullah's wife queen rania posted an image to her four hundred thousand instagram followers shortly after meeting with the pilot's family
we are all moath it said in arabic beneath a picture representing a fighter jet in the colors of the jordanian flag
from the start jordan has played a pivotal part in the u.s. led coalition against isis but it was not a popular war within jordan which only added to the pressure on the authorities to secure al kasasbeh's release
in late december isis published in its english language online magazine dabiq what it claimed was an interview with the pilot
al kasasbeh was shown wearing what appeared to be an orange jumpsuit
asked whether he knew what isis would do with him he replied
yes
they will kill me
the militants claimed they captured al kasasbeh after he ejected from the crashing of his f sixteen on december twenty four
the pilot was part of the u.s. led coalition airstrikes near isis de facto capital raqqa
images provided by isis's media wing and circulated widely on social media showed bearded men with kalashnikovs pulling the terrified airman out of a nearby river
we entered the region of raqqa to sweep the area then the striker jets entered to begin their attack al kasasbeh said according to the online publication
my plane was struck by a heat seeking missile
i heard and felt its hit
the jordanian government and u.s. central command said the aircraft had crashed but adamantly stated isis had not shot it down as the group claims
i checked the system display and it indicated that the engine was damaged and burning the pilot was quoted as saying
the plane began to deviate from its normal flight path so i ejected
i landed in the furat river by parachute and the seat caught on some ground keeping me fixed until i was captured by soldiers of the islamic state

that was the question following a new message purportedly from the terrorist group that pushed jordan to bring convicted terrorist sajida al rishawi to the turkish border by five thirty p.m.
if they didn't according to the message jordanian pilot moaz al kassasbeh would be killed followed soon thereafter by kenji goto of japan
for days jordanian officials have said they're willing to swap al rishawi for al kassasbeh
government spokesman mohammed al momani reiterated as much late thursday afternoon about an hour before the purported deadline
he said jordan is not about to pull off a deal yet having received no proof that its pilot is still alive
we need a proof of life so we can proceed the government spokesman said
if jordan gets such proof and releases al rishawi it is not clear whether that would mean goto also goes free
or al kassasbeh for that matter
so the drama continues with so much unsettled and so much on the line
early friday japan's foreign minister described the situation as still fluid and changing
we need to continue to deal with this in a state of alert fumio kishida told reporters
isis has shown its willingness to kill hostages before the first being american journalist james foley last summer and the latest being haruna yukawa an aspiring security contractor from japan reportedly killed last week
but is it willing to negotiate with governments that are fighting to stop its brutal expansive campaign to expand what it calls the islamic state 
the drama is coming after the latest message posted by isis supporters purportedly featuring goto's voice
cnn could not independently confirm the authenticity of the latest message which was read by a person claiming to be goto and posted online by isis supporters
al momani said that the competent authorities are still checking on the authenticity of the recent recording state tv reported about two hours before the possible deadline
it follows another recording in which isis at first demanded two hundred million dollar to free goto and yukawa
a few days later there was a new message this one with a man's voice claiming to be goto saying that the terror group was dropping its ransom request and instead demanding a swap of the japanese journalist for al rishawi
in the third recording in this string goto purportedly gives jordan twenty four hours to release the convicted terrorist in exchange for my life
jordanian foreign minister nasser judeh had said his country would release al rishawi if isis released al kassasbeh
judeh has said that the japanese journalist has not been forgotten
of course goto's release would be part of a prisoner exchange judeh said
but the priority for jordan he made clear is al kassasbeh's freedom
who are those involved in this complicated crisis involving several countries 
al rishawi is an iraqi prisoner on death row in jordan for her role in two thousand and five bombings
goto an experienced war journalist has been at the center of several threats by isis since his capture
last week the group demanded two hundred million dollar from japan in exchange for goto and fellow japanese hostage haruna yukawa an aspiring security contractor
since then isis has claimed yukawa is dead but goto is still alive
al kassasbeh was captured by isis last month after the fighter jet he was flying crashed in syria
isis says he's still alive but jordan's foreign minister told cnn his government has asked for a proof of life but hasn't received it
they are not just captives but people with loved ones desperately seeking their release
the forty seven year old goto left japan last fall when his youngest of two daughters was a mere three weeks old
now his family including his wife rinko who heard from his captors first on december two and most recently in a wednesday email with their final demand wants him back
my husband is a good and honest man who went to syria to show the plight of those who suffer she said in a statement released through the rory peck trust a nonprofit focused on freelance journalists

i beg the jordanian and japanese government to understand that the fates of both are in their hands
relatives of the jordanian pilot captured after he ejected from his f sixteen jet last month near raqqa the extremist group's de facto capital in syria have also been outspoken pressing officials in amman to do all they can to secure his release
i firmly ask whomever has sent moaz to fight outside the borders of jordan on a mission unrelated to us to make strong efforts to bring back moaz the captive's father safi al kassasbeh said tuesday adding that he believes his son's situation and goto's shouldn't be mixed up
safi al kassasbeh made his case again thursday evening after the sunset deadline had passed
i ask you in the name of god and his prophet and all the believers and the names of tens of millions in jordan and palestine in kindness to release my son and the son of all jordanians who is your brother in the islam religion and because forgiveness is a message of the prophet he told reporters

those are the new details released by the indonesia's national transportation safety committee in a news conference thursday
though it's common for the co pilot to be in control of the aircraft significant questions still linger over the crash of the airasia jet
why did the plane start a sudden steep ascent 
was bad weather a factor 
qz eight thousand five hundred and one crashed december twenty eight as it flew from the indonesian city of surabaya toward singapore
there were one hundred and sixty two people on board
the plane was in good condition and entire crew were all certified said mardjono siswosuwarno the chief investigator for the transportation committee
the flight took off and cruised at thirty two thousand feet amid stormy weather
about eleven twelve p.m. utc the pilot asked the control tower whether it could ascend to thirty eight thousand feet according to the committee
the plane was veering left and wobbling said ertata lanang galih a senior pilot and investigator with the committee
qz eight thousand five hundred and one then ascended from its cruising altitude to thirty seven thousand four hundred feet in about thirty seconds in a steep ascent said mardjono
commercial planes are not designed to ascend so quickly analysts have said
it may have been climbing at a rate twice as fast as it could and should one analyst told cnn
the stall warnings which blare the words stall stall went on as the plane started the steep climb and continued until it crashed according to information on the flight data recorder
the voice warning doesn't always mean the aircraft has stalled said mardjono
the warning can be triggered when the angle of attack which is the angle at which the wing tackles the oncoming wind hits eight degrees
the plane dropped quickly falling to twenty four thousand feet out of radar detection
air traffic control permitted the plane to ascend to thirty four thousand feet about four minutes after the pilot's initial request
officials have said that the aircraft climbed rapidly before it fell into the water
last week indonesian transportation minister ignasius jonan said the airasia jet stalled after its sudden ascent
investigators have submitted their preliminary report into the crash officials said
but tatang kurniadi the chief of the national transportation safety committee said they would not release the preliminary report during a thursday news briefing
why was airasia jet the only one in trouble 
it's unclear whether or when the initial report will be released fully to the public
while the preliminary report presents facts officials indicated there isn't enough verification yet
the french co pilot remi emmanuel plesel had less experience than the captain
plesel forty six had two thousand two hundred and seventy five hours with airasia indonesia compared with the captain known only as irianto who had six thousand one hundred hours on airasia on the airbus three hundred and twenty
irianto had more than twenty thousand flying hours under his belt having worked for another airline in indonesia for thirteen years before that and had been a indonesian air force pilot for a decade prior
but it's common for the co pilot to be in control of the aircraft
they usually rotate back and forth said david soucie a cnn aviation expert
and that's a matter of maintaining experience
you wouldn't want one pilot to get all the flight time and the others not to be current on what's going on
indonesian aviation investigators are trying to establish why flight eight thousand five hundred and one went down in an area of heavy thunderstorms last month while other planes nearby completed their journeys safely
authorities have recovered seventy two bodies from the sea with ninety still unaccounted for according to airasia


few people would consider those with loved ones on airasia flight qz eight thousand five hundred and one lucky but sarah bajc has a particular perspective
i'm almost a little jealous in a way because you know at least they have this ability to put some closure to it she told cnn's new day on tuesday after the wreckage of the airasia flight was found
her partner philip woods was on board malaysia airlines flight three hundred and seventy which disappeared without a trace almost ten months ago
we're still in limbo
there's still no evidence as to what happened to the plane she said struggling to hold back tears
earlier before the discovery of the airasia flight bajc described feeling an incredible ache
she said
it's a physical pain through your whole body
and just imagining what all those families are feeling as well i can imagine it
unfortunately i know exactly what they're going through
so does danica weeks whose husband was on mh three hundred and seventy
the plane disappeared from radar screens on a flight between malaysia and china on march eight
on sunday airasia flight qz eight thousand five hundred and one went missing over the java sea on its way from the indonesian city of surabaya to singapore with one hundred and sixty two people on board
debris was recovered tuesday in the waters off indonesia
the last few days has been torment
it's brought everything back
we're just reliving what we've gone through weeks said
it's a horrible nightmare
bajc said families of mh three hundred and seventy victims have banded together as they wake up each day without their loved ones
and it's vital that relatives of airasia eight thousand five hundred and one reach out for support weeks said
you just have to call on your close friends and family she said
you need to lean on them because they are basically the only way you get through this
nine months none of us are as strong as we used to be
in the weeks following mh three hundred and seventy's disappearance the grand ballroom at beijing's lido hotel turned into the briefing room for relatives of those on board the flight
every day the families came in hoping for a miracle
and every day they left dejected
on tuesday the ballroom was dark and empty
the family assistance center was closed
many families feel they've been forgotten
but the search for mh three hundred and seventy goes on
crews are still scouring the southern indian ocean with a variety of high tech equipment
but no wreckage has been found
at the malaysian government's request australia is leading the search efforts
the australian transport safety bureau said last week that the mapping of the sea floor continues and a vessel is still searching underwater for the plane
our work will continue to be thorough and methodical so sometimes weekly progress may seem slow the atsb said
please be assured that work is continuing and is aimed at finding mh three hundred and seventy as quickly as possible
but families of those passengers and crew may have to wait even longer
assuming no significant delays with vessels equipment or from the weather the current underwater search area may be largely completed around may two thousand and fifteen the atsb said
weeks has no choice but to wait
we will never find peace until we do what's right by our loved ones and that's bring them home to us

guinea liberia and sierra leone had a combined total of ninety nine new cases for the week ending january twenty five the who said
the total breaks down to sixty five in sierra leone thirty in guinea and four in liberia
the number of cases continued to fall in liberia and sierra leone who said but guinea's figure rose from twenty confirmed cases in the previous week
the western district of forecariah where the local community has shown high levels of resistance to measures to limit the disease's spread was the worst affected in guinea with half the new cases for the week the report said
the response to the ebola epidemic has now moved to a second phase who said as the focus shifts from slowing transmission to ending the epidemic
to achieve this goal as quickly as possible efforts have moved from rapidly building infrastructure to ensuring that capacity for case finding case management safe burials and community engagement is used as effectively as possible
there have been more than twenty two thousand reported confirmed probable and suspected cases since the outbreak began with almost eight thousand eight hundred known deaths
according to the latest who report children are less susceptible than adults to contracting the virus which spreads through direct contact with an infected person's bodily fluids
people aged fifteen to forty four are approximately three times more likely to be affected than children aged up to fourteen while adults aged forty five and older are almost four times more likely to be affected than are children
even as the number of cases drops scientists around the world continue to study the virus in a bid to understand how it works and help develop more effective vaccines against it
dr. anavaj sakuntabhai human geneticist at the pasteur institute in paris is part of a team working to sequence the virus and monitor how it mutates
it's very important for us to follow what happens with the virus sequence he told cnn
while the virus is not that mutated yet he said it's important for us to monitor how it changes and see whether it is more contagious or more lethal
his team is using samples from blood collected from guinea and processed by colleagues based in dakar senegal who've been working on the ebola project since april last year
sakuntabhai's team has sequenced about twenty samples so far and hopes to do another one hundred in the coming weeks ultimately sequencing several hundred
many people's fears have focused on whether the virus could change to become airborne but it doesn't appear to be easy for it to mutate sufficiently to alter the mode of transmission he said
sakuntabhai said it was normal for the virus to change and that it's not something to be frightened of at the moment

david was a patriot
david was a warrior when he needed to be and also a peacemaker james berry said about his son
he was intelligent and resourceful
he would not break down in a fight when liberty freedom and justice was at stake
i lost a son yesterday but i believe in what david did and i stand proud of him while i privately mourn he told cnn's the lead with jake tapper on wednesday
the libyan branch of isis has claimed responsibility for the gun and bomb attack that killed five foreigners including berry an american security contractor
five libyans also died in tuesday's attack on the corinthia hotel said a spokesman for a security division of the ministry of interior in tripoli essam al naas
two attackers were killed he said saying it appeared they were libyans
the five star hotel is known as one where foreigners and government officials stay and meet to conduct business
the libyan branch of isis released photos of the two gunmen it said had carried out the attacks identifying them as abu ibraheem al tunsi and abu sulaiman al sudani
their naming convention indicates that the men were of tunisian and sudanese origin respectively
the fbi is expected to open an investigation into the incident two u.s. officials told cnn
according to military records berry was in the u.s. marine corps completing six deployments in afghanistan kuwait and iraq
he retired in september two thousand and twelve after a dozen years of service
he was working for crucible a security firm

the other foreigners killed in the attack were a french citizen and three people from tajikistan al naas said
the french foreign ministry confirmed that a french citizen was among the dead but did not identify the victim
the tripoli government which is not internationally recognized said the intended target of the attack was its prime minister omar al hassi but the claim has not been confirmed
al naas said that at least two libyan security personnel were killed in the attack
an online group that supports isis said the attack was carried out in the name of abu anas al libi
he was an alleged al qaeda operative accused of involvement in the bombing of u.s. embassies in africa
he was captured by u.s. special forces in tripoli in two thousand and thirteen
he died in a u.s. hospital this month
it's this declared link to al libi's capture by the united states that has prompted the fbi to investigate
fighters loyal to isis have for several months been in control of the mediterranean port city of derna in eastern libya near the border with egypt
they are suspected in other attacks elsewhere in libya including in tobruk al bayda and tripoli
tuesday's attack began when militants detonated a car bomb in the parking lot of the hotel
the gunmen then shot their way into the hotel
the high rise hotel is popular among government officials some of whom live there
until now it was seen as one of the remaining secure locations in tripoli for diplomatic and government activity
the attack different in scale and coordination to those seen previously even after months of violence in libya's east sends the message that nowhere in the country or its capital is safe
authorities say they are now in control of the hotel premises and are starting their investigation
the self proclaimed tripoli government formed by a coalition of militias holds sway only over the capital and surrounding areas
the internationally recognized parliament was forced to leave the capital after militia groups seized control of the city in the summer
the u.s. embassy in tripoli the united nations and other international organizations and businesses also evacuated their staffs from tripoli in the summer due to the unrest
the u.s. state department last week issued a warning advising u.s. citizens against all travel to libya and recommending that any u.s. citizens currently in the north african country should leave immediately
extremist groups in libya have made several specific threats against u.s. government officials citizens and interests in libya it said
because of the presumption that foreigners especially u.s. citizens in libya may be associated with the u.s. government or u.s
non governmental organizations travelers should be aware that they may be targeted for kidnapping violent attacks or death

using powerful optics they have found a much larger planet like body j one thousand four hundred and seven b with rings two hundred times the size of saturn's u.s. and dutch astronomers said
it lies some four hundred light years away from earth
for decades scientists have believed that many moons around large planets formed out of such ring systems
but this is the first one astronomers have observed outside of our solar system they said
it was discovered in two thousand and twelve but a detailed analysis of its data was recently completed and published
if j one thousand four hundred and seven b were in our solar system it would dominate earth's nightly sky
if we could replace saturn's rings with the rings around j one thousand four hundred and seven b they would be easily visible at night and be many times larger than the full moon said matthew kenworthy from the netherlands leiden observatory
unlike galileo peering a relatively short distance through his simple telescope today's astronomers can't eyeball the rings hundreds of light years away
but using two very powerful optical devices with eight cameras each they can observe the effect the rings have as they pass across nearby star j one thousand four hundred and seven written without a b at the end
it is similar to our sun
the rings of planet j one thousand four hundred and seven b eclipse its light
with the enormous size of the rings the eclipse the astronomers observed lasted fifty six days
but the star did not go completely dark for nearly two months
some of j one thousand four hundred and seven b's thirty rings are denser blocking more light and some of them are less dense letting more light through
and there are gaps between the rings leading the scientists to theorize that exomoons have formed and cut clean orbits through the debris like the moons around saturn
our own solar system's ringed giant has at least sixty moons according to nasa
like its system of rings planet j one thousand four hundred and seven b is also much larger than saturn said astrophysicist eric mamajek whose team at the university of rochester discovered the object
you could think of it as kind of a super saturn
it is called a brown dwarf a size classification somewhere between a planet and a star according to the california institute of technology
brown dwarfs are hot but don't burst into nuclear fusion the way stars do so they don't give off light
the scientists are calling on amateur astronomers to keep an eye on star j one thousand four hundred and seven in hopes they may observe the rings eclipsing it again and report the results to the american association of variable star observers which collects astronomical data on stars that change in brightness
and astronomers will also search for more such ringed systems

for two weeks boko haram gunmen have sacked dozens of villages in michika district close to the border with cameroon slaughtering male residents and abducting others said adamu kamale a lawmaker representing michika district in the adamawa state house of assembly
they move house to house killing people including the old abducting women and children and burning homes kamale said tuesday
he said villages are littered with bodies and there is no one to bury them because residents have fled thousands of them heading off into the mountains or across the border into cameroon to escape the onslaught
they slaughter people like animals he said
now seventy percents of the people in the district have been dislodged from the homes
some of them have run into the mountains while others have crossed into cameroon or fled to yola the capital of adamawa state kamale said
the villagers ordeal is horrific but sadly nothing new for boko haram
the terrorist group its name translating as western education is sin has been a force in nigeria for years
it tries to use religion to justify its actions which are aimed at imposing its strict version of of sharia law in nigeria which is split between a majority muslim north and a mostly christian south
boko haram has intensified its attacks in recent years standing defiant against the nigerian military
and it hasn't gone after only government troops or officials with civilians often becoming victims
the group has been tied to a spate of assassinations market bombings attacks on churches and unaffiliated mosques and raids of villages including those earlier this month in michika district
mass kidnappings have also been part of its playbook most notoriously the taking of more than two hundred schoolgirls from chibok last april
boys and young men have been abducted as well including forty between the ages of ten and twenty three reportedly taken captive on new year's eve in borno state and ninety seven others kidnapped in and around the village of doron baga in august
and whether or not they were former captives boko haram may be boasting about its use of child soldiers in its fight
an organization calling itself boko haram's official mouthpiece this week even promoted an alleged military training camp for children on its twitter feed posting images of children in formation holding ak forty seven weapons
while cnn can not independently verify the authenticity of the photos intelligence sources said the images appear to be real and are consistent with the islamist extremist group's strategy of forcibly recruiting and training children
and the u.s. state department lent credibility to the report by tweeting a photo of the young heavily armed children along with these words
amid its massacres of innocents boko haram running training camps for child soldiers
the release of these photos and the new twitter account appear to coincide with an ever more sophisticated media strategy on the part of boko haram
the change in tactics appears to emulate isis even down to the use of islamic chants or nasheeds
last week a video was posted on the same account purporting to be an interview with boko haram's spokesman
both the interviewer and the subject were masked and the production values were far more sophisticated than anything the terror group has published before
boko haram's campaign has left thousands of nigerians in danger in some cases with the central government and others seemingly unable to help
the latest bloodshed began in michika township which boko haram took over in september and declared to be part of its caliphate
the insurgents then moved into villages including murva bororo ghumci garta kasa kamale boka futu and kwabaride
humanitarian workers have been unable to reach residents who fled into the mountains said mohammed kanar head of the national emergency management agency for northeast nigeria
we are aware there are people trapped in the mountains but they are inaccessible
the security situation is a challenge in reaching them and offering them humanitarian assistance kanar said
kamale said the military has not responded to complaints that he and other community leaders lodged calling for its intervention
sometimes we alert the military when they are advancing on villages before they attack but no action is taken to stop them he said
these insurgents have been killing with impunity
when they attack a village they will sleep there for the night after the slaughter and move on the next morning the lawmaker said
there has been no reaction from the military to kamale's specific allegation
amnesty international on wednesday leveled a similar accusation saying it had evidence that the nigerian military was warned repeatedly about impending boko haram attacks on civilians late last year on bogo and monguno
these attacks are an urgent wake up call for the nigerian leadership the african union and the international community said amnesty's netsanet belay
it is essential to protect hundreds of thousands of civilians in northeast nigeria from boko haram's continued onslaught
the nigerian defense ministry responded by calling the allegation misleading saying that amnesty's use of these unfortunate activities of terrorists to find fault with the counterterrorism operations as usual is inaccurate and unfair
the defense ministry said its forces have enhanced their intelligence abilities troop deployment and coordination and logistics capabilities
in actual fact the protection of civilian populations is the essence of the entire counterterrorism operation the ministry said

indeed the troops were prepared and duly engaged the terrorists in all the instances referred to by amnesty international


its ability to win the release of a jailed jihadist in jordan or the ability of its followers in libya to attack a tripoli hotel may provide brief propaganda boons but they don't affect the fundamentals on the ground
nor will its attempts to export terror to europe
but lest anyone declare victory predictions of isis demise are wildly optimistic
isis still controls some fifty thousand square kilometers of iraq as well as up to thirty percents of syrian territory and at least ten percents of its population
to the west of baghdad it is still on the offensive in anbar and recently raided checkpoints on the iraqi saudi border
pentagon spokesman rear admiral john kirby said last week
we're only six to seven months into this thing.this is going to be a long struggle
a senior official at the u.s. state department echoed kirby's line this week saying isis expulsion from kobani is part of the early phase of a multi year campaign
isis is a very adaptive organization the official said and terms like turning point were to be avoided
even so there's quite a contrast between september when u.s. officials said the fall of kobani to isis seemed inevitable and kurds celebrating on the city's streets this week
isis chose kobani as a symbol of its virility even sending hostage john cantile there to make a video about the group's inevitable victory
kobani was a recruitment poster in isis efforts to draw more foreign fighters to the caliphate
isis continued to reinforce its presence in the town despite constant airstrikes
general john allen u.s. coordinator of the campaign against isis said in november that the group had impaled itself on kobani
the state department official said isis losses there likely running into four figures could help counter the messaging that has attracted foreign fighters
a narrative of inevitable glory and conquest had been replaced by images of bodies left on the streets the official said
a growing number of those foreign fighters may also be disillusioned after several months of airstrikes
setbacks in kobani and elsewhere have led to a stream of deserters dozens of whom have been executed according to local activists cited by the syrian observatory on human rights
analysts say one trend in coming months may be a stream of disillusioned foreigners trying to escape isis territory
in iraq a leading expert on isis hisham al hashimi told cnn that isis has now lost ground in several areas and needs to regroup
torbjorn soltvedt a senior analyst at consultancy verisk maplecroft agrees that isis is on the back foot in iraq relying more on classic insurgency tactics such as roadside bombs and unable to move in force because of the threat of airstrikes
among its latest reverses isis has lost control over a number of villages in the province of diyala north east of baghdad
iraqi troops and shia militia known as popular mobilization units launched an offensive last week to retake isis last strongholds around muqdadiyah fifty miles from the capital
according to iraqi commanders the whole province of diyala is now back in government hands after several months of intermittent battles
soltvedt says it became increasingly difficult for isis to sustain its supply lines in the region
the key prize for all sides in iraq remains mosul a city of one point five million people on the tigris river held by isis since last june
isis has invested heavily in governing the city
its leader abu bakr al baghdadi pronounced his leadership of the caliphate at the grand mosque there last july
for their part kurdish officials say that as long as isis holds mosul it threatens kurdistan
likewise neither the government in baghdad nor its coalition partners can rest while terrorists occupy iraq's second largest city
peshmerga forces have made steady progress against isis north and west of mosul over the last two months
they have taken some three thousand square kilometers of the sinjar area as well as the area around the mosul dam choking off access routes and threatening isis main resupply route to syria
to the south iraqi forces gains around baiji have also restricted isis freedom of movement
the institute for the study of war which studies military activity in iraq and syria says isis is preparing to dig a defensive trench around mosul and has blown up a bridge on a key western approach
isw also reports an increase in executions by isis across nineveh province where mosul is located which it sees as further evidence isis is feeling pressured by internal resistance in the province
there had been talk of a january offensive to retake mosul but any assault now seems many weeks away
kirby told cnn's barbara starr tuesday that the timing could not be predicted but obviously we're working closely with iraqi security forces on helping them better understand the challenges of an assault on mosul
iraqi units are already fully occupied elsewhere notably in anbar province where isis threatens ramadi and other areas
an assault on mosul would have to be meticulously co ordinated from several different directions informed by good intelligence and supported from the air
a massive intelligence gathering effort is already under way according to analysts
even so mosul's remaining residents are predominantly sunni arabs and would be wary of kurdish and shia militia so regular forces from the reconstituted iraqi army would likely have to take the lead
the recent history of urban warfare in iraq should give pause analysts say recalling the brutal battles to evict al qaeda from fallujah in two thousand and four
soltvedt says an uprising from within is much preferable to an assault from without and some observers predict any operation to retake mosul wouldn't happen until early summer
another problem for isis is that coalition airstrikes and ground operations by iraqi and peshmerga forces appear to be whittling away isis commanders even if claims by some us officials that half of isis leadership has been taken out appear optimistic
among prominent casualties reported by iraqi and kurdish officials in the past two months are isis governor for anbar province abu anas samarraie and abu muslim al turkmani a member of isis shura council its highest policy making body
soltvedt says some of isis most seasoned fighters have also left iraq some returning to libya for example
more importantly he says there is only a finite pool of skilled military commanders some of them former officers in saddam hussein's army and they will have a problem replacing them if they are killed
even where isis suffers defeat there is no guarantee the iraqi government can secure and hold territory
the prominent role of shia militia may yet make it difficult for baghdad to pacify areas after isis retreats
during the diyala offensive the militia killed some seventy sunni civilians a local member of parliament nahida al daini told reuters
others claimed the militia had burned down houses and mosques
the iraqi interior ministry denied the claims but it's not the first time these militia have been accused of atrocities during military offensives and that may weaken the readiness of sunni tribes to help the government against isis
the iraqi government has proposed bringing the militia under the umbrella of a national guard
oil minister adel abdul mahdi wrote on his facebook page that it would be possible to organize the shia popular mobilization forces the sunni sons of iraq and the peshmerga under the umbrella of the national guard knowing that the main goal of the latter is to prevent the emergence of militias put all the weapons under the supervision of the state and provide backup forces when needed
but there is plenty of resistance to the idea because such militia have often been the best guarantee of a community's security
in areas it liberates the iraqi government will have to provide security rehabilitation and effective governance to people who with good reason don't believe baghdad can provide any of the above
isis also benefits from being able to use both syrian and iraqi territory as the battlefield shifts
while under pressure in northern iraq its forces can regroup across the border in syria's hasaka province
it can also use the frontier from deir ezzor into iraq's anbar province where it enjoys real strategic depth and the iraqi army struggles with long supply lines says soltvedt
it has even begun to probe the iraqi saudi border
isis also controls a number of small oil fields and an arsenal of weaponry captured in both iraq and syria
and it still has money
iraqi finance minister hoshyar zebari told reuters he estimates isis has looted four hundred and fifty six million dollar from banks in mosul tikrit and baiji since june
and it has set up a rudimentary taxation system in the main cities it controls as well as a fearsome intelligence apparatus
but isis is finding the job of controlling much harder than that of attacking
it has needed an expensive and labor intensive mix of coercion intimidation and policing to run mosul where the iraqi government still pays the bulk of state employees salaries
under pressure on several fronts isis now has to think very carefully about where it puts its forces says soltvedt



kirchner has sent a draft bill to the country's parliament which if passed would mean the secretariat of intelligence is replaced by the federal intelligence agency
in a taped statement aired monday night on national tv kirchner said the service had not served the interests of the country
the body of alberto nisman a special prosecutor investigating the one thousand nine hundred and ninety four bombing of a jewish community center in buenos aires was found inside his apartment on january eighteen the day before he was due to testify before congress about his claims
the previous week he had filed a report alleging that the president foreign minister and other officials conspired to cover up iran's involvement in the bomb attack which killed eighty five in exchange for an oil and grain for meat deal
nisman died of a gunshot wound to the temple
a gun and a shell casing were found near his body and the apartment was locked from the inside
at first glance a suicide
but the untimely death raised suspicions immediately
then investigators looking into his death said there was no gunpowder residue on his hands as would have been expected and a locksmith who let nisman's mother into the apartment told reporters that anyone could have opened the lock
kirchner who initially called nisman's death a suicide soon reversed her thinking and called it the suicide was not a suicide
however while fernandez does not believe that nisman took his own life she still insists that his allegations against her government are false
nisman was not a hack with an agenda against the president but a naive investigator who was used by others who fed him false information fernandez said
nisman's report promised to provide evidence of the existence of a sophisticated criminal plot deliberately conjured to cover up and provide impunity to the iranians accused in the investigation of the attack of the jewish community center in one thousand nine hundred and ninety four
the two hundred and eighty nine page report makes its case based on tapped telephone conversations between representatives of argentina and iran




you may dismiss those childhood aspirations as unrealistic now you're an adult with responsibilities and bills to pay but that role reflected what you enjoyed doing and who you were at that time
the dream jobs we aspire to as children are a window into our passions and talents says linkedin's career expert nicole williams
identifying and understanding those passions are key to improving our performance and enjoyment of the jobs we currently do even if they aren't specific to the careers we dreamed of as kids
so what influences our childhood aspirations 
when we're small most of us have a limited idea of what's out there explains career coach meredith haberfeld
it is shaped by the exposure we have the people that have a big impact on us and the standards and social expectations around us
our families greatly influence our outlook on life
if we look up to one family member in particular we tend to be drawn to their careers as we want to be like them
indeed when meredith was a little girl she wanted to be a librarian because her grandmother who she admired was one
and it's not just our relatives roles at work that can influence children's aspirations
the gender roles that our parents take on at home can also dramatically impact our childhood career choices
a study by alyssa croft of the university of british columbia found that the division of labor at home had implications for how girls identities developed in gender roles
croft told cnn that fathers behavior around the house seems to be predicting their daughter's career aspirations beyond what they might be publicly endorsing or specifically saying about gender roles
she found that if fathers talked about supporting gender equality but didn't take on an equal role in domestic tasks then this sent conflicting signals to their daughters which led to daughters placing more weight on their father's actions rather than his words
by contrast where fathers demonstrated their beliefs in gender equality by taking on an equal distribution of domestic tasks then their daughters would select roles that are more gender neutral or even sort of male stereotypic like being a scientist or athlete croft says
and that could have a major impact on our pay check down the line
research by the london school of economics published in the journal social forces found that girls who aspired to traditionally female dominated occupations were far more likely to earn lower wages in their first job since stereotypically female jobs tend to pay less
stereotypically male or female preferences that children exhibit during childhood continue into and affect their adult lives says lucinda platt professor of social policy and sociology at lse
our early experiences can also have a bearing on what we see as our dream job a positive experience linked to a potential career can be hugely inspiring
i went through an intense marine biologist phase fueled by a life changing snorkeling expedition when i was seven years old reveals hayley barna co founder and co ceo of beauty start up birchbox
and inspiration can also strike at school if we learn about a career that resonates with us
when i was in the four th grade aged nine ten i learned about lobbyists
i thought it would be amazing job to try and influence important issues says joanne bradford head of partnerships at pinterest
when we are young our aspirations are a response to our circumstances
but haberfeld says that when the time comes to start designing our careers we begin tuning in to what we feel compelled to express about ourselves
clara shih founder of hearsay social started out with a long and varied list of possible careers she went through phases of wanting to be a teacher a police officer an astronaut and an attorney
only in high school when i began programming computers did i become interested in tech and start ups which led me to attend stanford and major in computer science she says
while many of us turn our backs on our childhood ambitions when faced with the realities of life as a grown up some really do end up in their dream jobs
a survey of the childhood career aspirations of more than eight thousand professionals from around the world carried out for social networking site linkedin found that thirty point three percents of the site's members were either currently in the job they had always dreamed of or in a career linked to those plans
creator and presenter of digital futures shivvy jervis is one of those living out her early dreams
even as an eight year old swinging ponytails et al i would wave around my plastic mic and scrawl little scripts to deliver to a pretend audience
she says
when i was fifteen i announced with assured clarity to my family that my dream job was to be a producer and tv journalist
sometimes our careers begin at such an early age that there's little to think about
four time paralympic champion ellie simmonds obe started swimming when she was five
by the time she was eight she was competing against able bodied children
i'm not sure i thought too much on what career i was interested in when i was a child she says
i always just wanted to have a farm and work with horses when i was very young though the thought of working with children is something i've thought about since
i'm very fortunate that my swimming career took off when i was very young so it was never really a question
but no matter how early we step on to that treadmill it's never too late to change tack
thinking back to our childhood ambitions can help us work out which aspects of our current job we love
after hayley barna's marine biologist phase passed she says i never had a single career in mind
i always pictured myself being able to do many things at once
engineer president of the united states investment banker professional skier magazine editor
i haven't checked the box on any of those specifically but i feel lucky that my current role blends a lot of different disciplines
when we were children our aspirations were limitless and anything seemed possible
by recapturing that excitement and allowing it to inform your research and networking two thousand and fifteen could be the year you find your dream job

can failing be good for your career 

i felt really sorry for him said award winning australian artist ben quilty who has been mentoring sukuamaran a convicted drug smuggler in bali's kerobokan prison since late two thousand and eleven
but i also said myuran what are you doing 
are you just going to sit around and wait for this 
you've got nothing else to do go back to work and start making paintings 
so he did
in the last week or so sukumaran has thrown himself into his painting and the prison art classes he set up and leads five days a week
he knows that in the days or weeks ahead he could be led out of his cell with andrew chan his co conspirator in a failed two thousand and five drug plot blindfolded and shot by an indonesian firing squad
the men now aged thirty three and thirty one can only wait and hope that a final legal bid succeeds in saving their lives
later this week the men's indonesian lawyers hope to file what's known as a pk to request a second judicial review
australian lawyer julian mcmahon said there's a strong basis for another review to be granted
the first pk was filed four years ago and was eventually rejected however so the next step was the clemency process under the clemency law and the constitution mcmahon said
however he said that while the matter was being considered by the offices of the previous and current president the law changed to allow for a second judicial review
he said it's not appropriate to file a second judicial review while the matter is sitting with the president
now that the letters from the president have rejected clemency that enables the second judicial review to be brought on
lawyers will be pointing to evidence of the men's rehabilitation in prison
during their time behind bars they've said to have become respected inmates who have built a support network for others around them
they're both behaving in a very dignified way mcmahon said who visited them in prison as recently as wednesday morning
they're looking after their families who are visiting and they're both working hard on the same things they've been doing for years
myuran running an art class and andrew running a prayer service
president joko widodo has made it clear he won't be stepping in to save the pair the only two of the drug gang known as the bali nine who were sentenced to death
widodo told cnn's christiane amanpour earlier this week every day we have fifty people die because of narcotics of drugs
in one year it's eighteen thousand people who die because of narcotics
we are not going to compromise for drug dealers
no compromise
no compromise
the last time quilty visited sukumaran in his prison art class he said the talented painter had already worked out a succession plan so the classes would continue without him
last time i felt like he wasted an hour with me just talking through the logistics about how the classes would run if he's gone which was very upsetting quilty said
he pointed out to me in the class quietly who the strong artists were with the most future in the art practice
and he also introduced me to the two young indonesian men who he's basically mentoring to take over his role if he's gone
last weekend the families of both men made a public appeal for their lives to be spared
i'm confident that if knows what they've done and how much they have changed i'm sure he would not have the heart to order them to be executed myuran's mother raji sukumaran said tearfully
the men were arrested in bali in two thousand and five after australian federal police told indonesian authorities that they'd received a tip off
four couriers with heroin strapped to the bodies were arrested with chan as they tried to leave indonesia
sukumaran was detained in a kuta hotel with three others who had been enlisted as mules
on thursday night a candlelight vigil organized by quilty will be held in sydney's martin place as a show of support for the two prisoners
musicians will perform in a concert called music for mercy
quilty said it's not an attempt to convince the indonesian authorities to spare them that's out of my hands but a personal tribute to his friend and to show sukumaran that he and chan are not alone
it seemed like there was a very dark inevitability about what was going to happen to myuran
and i thought what can i do 
i thought i can actually show the boys that there are people who care for them just to give them a sense of dignity i guess

sometimes we have to balance our need to speak to them about human rights issues with immediate concerns that we have in terms of countering terrorism or dealing with regional stability obama said in an interview with cnn's fareed zakaria in india on tuesday
during his visit tuesday obama will make paying respects the bigger priority avoiding directly answering a question from zakaria on whether obama would discuss with the saudis the case of the political activist and blogger who was sentenced to twenty years in prison and one thousand lashes for his activism

what to expect when obama visits saudi arabia
and obama was candid that u.s. pressure to advance human rights or encourage political reforms isn't always appreciated and oftentimes that makes some of our allies uncomfortable
it makes them frustrated he said
and you know some of them listen and some don't obama said
in the list of those who don't obama recalled the unraveling of the egyptian dictatorship of hosni mubarak the former president of egypt who was overthrown in egypt's two thousand and eleven revolution
mubarak was one of the u.s.'s closest allies in the region during his three decades in office thanks in large part to a strong security agreement and mubarak's work to maintain peace with israel
obama said that he warned mubarak that the massive protests in tahrir square were not simply going to vanish urging mubarak to get out in front of reform and become the father of the egyptian democracy
i said mr
president i don't think this is a genie that you can put back in the bottle obama recalled
he said ah mr. president you don't understand society here
this is all going to be fine
it'll blow over 
and it didn't obama said
but the trendline is one that i will sustain throughout the rest of my presidency and that is to make an argument to those friends and allies of ours that if they want a society that is going to be able to sustain itself in this age then they're going to have to change how they do business obama said

islamic law generally forbids men from touching women to whom they are not related
however that rule is often times overlooked when official diplomatic delegations visit the kingdom
the white house notes that representatives of the united states including former secretaries of state hillary clinton and madeleine albright along with german chancellor angela merkel have all visited the saudi king and have all shaken hands with members of the saudi royal family
islamic experts also point to another central theme of islam
hospitality
when one is a guest in someone's home they are treated as family
obama also did not cover her head eschewing strict religious and cultural customs in saudi arabia where women wear a full body garment called an abaya and cover their heads with a hijab or the more conservative niqab which has only a slit for the eyes
obama's predecessor laura bush also did not cover her head during her two thousand and seven solo visit to saudi arabia and neither did hillary clinton during a two thousand and ten trip to the kingdom as secretary of state
another former secretary of state condoleeza rice also did not cover her head as she joined the u.s. delegation in saudi arabia on tuesday
but the u.s. state department advises other american women visiting the country that they could face problems if they don't cover their heads
women who choose not to conform to this dress code face a risk of confrontation by mutawwa and possible detention arrest the state department says on its website
while most incidents have resulted only in inconvenience or embarrassment the potential exists for an individual to be arrested physically harmed or deported
additionally female tourists who don't abide by the dress code or sidestep other religious laws like walking in public unaccompanied or mingling with men who aren't relatives risk being harassed pursued or assaulted by saudi citizens the state department warns
pool reporters traveling with the president on air force one also pointed out that in the receiving line at the airport in saudi arabia a more open setting than the palace michelle obama stood next to but slightly behind the president and held a small black clutch purse in front of her with both hands
reporters say they noticed that mrs. obama waited for a gesture to be made to her by the men who walked by and if the man initiated a handshake she smiled and shook their hand
if not both she and the man politely smiled and nodded heads
perceived problems of etiquette have come up before with the first lady
in two thousand and nine during her first meeting with queen elizabeth in britain she drew headlines when she hugged the monarch
british tabloids picked up on the embrace and some noted that etiquette wasn't followed because people aren't supposed to touch the queen
however other outlets quickly noted that the queen returned the hug

president obama has had his fair share of criticism as well
critics took issue when he bowed in front of saudi king abdullah at a g twenty meeting in two thousand and nine and again for bowing to the japanese emperor akihito
although aides at the time told cnn on condition of anonymity that it wasn't a bow
he grasped his hand with two hands and he's taller than king abdullah
former vice president dick cheney was one of obama's most vocal critics and said an american leader should never bow to anyone
however a state department spokesperson at the time told cnn that it's a natural response of the president the first time he meets the japanese head of state to show a sign of respect
obama defends saudi relationship
sometimes we have to balance 

fortunately they can rely on one committed defender
eight year old alyssa carter
when i heard that rhinos were being killed they were my favorite animals and i wanted to start this says the elementary school pupil
her campaign alyssa's save the rhinos has raised thousands of dollars to protect her favorite animal south africa's poacher threatened rhinoceros and fund an innovative scheme aimed at tracking the hunters who would do them harm
carter south africa national parks one and only rhino champion sells homemade chocolates for ten rand at her school
so far she has raised over twenty three thousand dollar through a combination of chocolate sales and donations from the growing number of people young and old who have filled halls to hear the young campaigner speak
it all started in may two thousand and thirteen when carter then aged six and a half came home from school and drew a picture
the same crayon image of long horned rhino beneath a rainbow that is now stamped on her campaign's sweets and chocolate
her father brian carter says she'd been taught about the plight of endangered animals and burst out crying when she heard rhinos were being butchered by poachers
at home that night the family resolved to do something to help settling on the chocolates as a good place to start
her father was her first customer
originally she just wanted to do something to help he says
the idea was to sell to anybody that would buy so we started off by selling to friends and family grannies and grandpas and people at church
for over a year she has been selling chocolates every friday at her supportive johannesburg primary school and has now grown her stall with rhino branded lollipops stickers biltong and a range of knitted rhino toys created by a well wisher who had heard about her fundraising efforts
carter knows her most enthusiastic customers
singling out one particularly generous schoolmistress teacher phuti and an exceptionally sweet toothed class of her schoolmates as her biggest supporters
dogs take bite out of poaching
what alyssa wanted to do was to give the money toward buying trained sniffer dogs to go into the kruger national park says dad brian
there across an area the size of new jersey park rangers fight a desperate battle with poachers to prevent the extinction of the rhinoceros whose horn is prized for its supposed value in traditional asian medicines
highly trained canines are a new addition to the park first arriving in two thousand and twelve
if they find a rhino lying dead they can sniff out where the poachers are explains alyssa carter allowing rangers track poachers just as the poachers themselves stalk prey
dogs will soon patrol the park's entrance points too detecting weapons that poachers attempt to smuggle in and contraband including rhinoceros horn being transported out
at kruger south africa's largest wildlife reserve park authorities report an increase in contact with suspected poachers with rangers claiming before christmas that one hundred and sixty four had been arrested in the park over the year
with each dog's purchase training and kennel costs running to over eight thousand dollar per dog they aren't cheap but the young rhino champion can now proudly boast to have already added two new k nine enforcers to the battle
but why rhinos 
they're nice and with their big horns they look beautiful and i like looking for them in the wild explains carter
before starting alyssa's save the rhinos the johannesburg resident had never seen a rhinoceros in its natural habitat
now she's been to kruger several times she says on invitation to meet the park's other honorary rangers on a few occasions and recently visiting two sniffer dogs in training last summer
she eagerly snaps photographs of every animal she sees in the park but rhinos hold a special place
it's really nice because i know i'm doing something she says
carter says she keeps count of each of the rhino she sees and is up to one hundred and thirty something so far
carter is keen to talk to others about her experiences with rhinos standing up in front of seven hundred students at a school in december and nearly three hundred adults at a development conference earlier that year
she says it's just as easy to talk to grown ups as kids as long as her father is by her side
the elder carter says he wasn't involved in conservation before alyssa started her campaign and that the whole family has caught the young activist's enthusiasm
the ambition now is for alyssa to talk at more corporate events including business golf days where she has found success encouraging businesspeople to give to the cause
the bottom line is we need to raise more money says brian and we need to sell more chocolates

a message purporting to be from the islamist terror group sets a new deadline for a possible deal with the jordanian government
the latest demand
bring convicted terrorist sajida al rishawi to the turkish border by sunset thursday or jordanian isis hostage moaz al kassasbeh will be executed immediately
but is isis offering anything in return 
from the latest message it's unclear
but previous video posts purportedly from isis have suggested the group was offering japanese hostage kenji goto's freedom in exchange for al rishawi's 
cnn could not independently confirm the authenticity of the latest message which was read by a person claiming to be goto and posted online by isis supporters
in the message goto purportedly calls for al rishawi's release in exchange for my life
it's the latest twist in a complicated crisis with dizzying developments involving several countries
here's a look at the key people involved
goto an experienced japanese war journalist has been at the center of several threats by isis since his capture
last week the group demanded two hundred million dollar from japan in exchange for goto and fellow japanese hostage haruna yukawa an aspiring security contractor
since then isis has claimed yukawa is dead but goto is still alive
al kassasbeh a jordanian pilot was captured by isis last month after the fighter jet he was flying crashed in syria
isis says he's still alive but jordan's foreign minister told cnn his government has asked for a proof of life but hasn't received it
al rishawi is an iraqi prisoner on death row in jordan for her role in two thousand and five bombings
isis has demanded her release by sunset thursday
jordan has said it's willing to swap al rishawi for the jordanian pilot
jordanian foreign minister nasser judeh told cnn on wednesday that his country would release al rishawi if isis released al kassasbeh
even though his government's announcement of its offer doesn't mention goto the foreign minister said that the japanese journalist is not forgotten
of course goto's release would be part of a prisoner exchange judeh told cnn's christiane amanpour
but the priority for jordan is al kassasbeh's freedom he said
it wasn't clear whether isis would accept jordan's offer
with the fates of their sons hanging in the balance the families of goto and al kassasbeh called on their governments to do everything they can to save the hostages before time runs out
goto forty seven is reported to have three children two of them with his current wife
his mother begged japanese prime minister shinzo abe to secure her son's release
please save the life of kenji junko ishido said
i call on you to work with all your strength in negotiations with the jordanian government until the very end
al kassasbeh's father has called on jordanian authorities to act as well
i firmly ask whomever has sent moaz to fight outside the borders of jordan on a mission unrelated to us to make strong efforts to bring back moaz safi al kassasbeh said tuesday
isis says it captured al kassasbeh after he ejected from his f sixteen jet last month near raqqa the militant group's de facto capital in syria
moaz's blood is precious it's precious and it represents the blood of all jordanians his father said
but the pilot's father suggested his son's case shouldn't be mixed up with goto's 
to link moaz's situation with the japanese journalist this has nothing to do with us he said
the japanese journalist has his country to defend him
isis which holds large areas of iraq and syria under its brutal rule has a grim track record of ruthlessly killing hostages
last year it publicized its series of beheadings of three american and two british captives
the group has made a series of demands regarding the jordanian and japanese hostages
in a saturday post purportedly from isis a voice thought to be goto's first set out the idea of exchanging him for al rishawi but no clear deadline was mentioned
in that post goto held a photo of what appeared to be yukawa's decapitated corpse
a post from the group on tuesday announced that time was suddenly in short supply for goto and the jordanian pilot
in that message the japanese hostage is shown handcuffed and dressed in orange holding a picture that appears to be al kassasbeh
i've been told this is my last message a voice purporting to be that of goto says demanding the prisoner exchange
the video had said that isis would kill al kassasbeh and goto within twenty four hours if jordan did not release al rishawi
cnn couldn't independently verify the authenticity of the messages
the japanese government said there was no evidence so far that it wasn't goto speaking in tuesday's video which was posted to youtube and distributed on social media by known isis supporters
on thursday japan's prime minister told lawmakers his government was analyzing the latest possible message from isis
given the nature of the issue we can not tell concrete details abe said
however within this extremely severe context the government has been requesting cooperation from the government of jordan and will continue making the utmost effort for swift release of mr. goto

separately in gaza the united nations said it was outraged when palestinian protesters climbed the perimeter of a u.n. compound and damaged it
u.n. officials took hamas to task for not preventing the incident
hezbollah fired five anti tank missiles at israeli military vehicles in the disputed shebaa farms area killing an officer and a soldier the israel defense forces said
sgt
dor chaim nini was twenty
capt
yochai kalangel was twenty five the idf said
the attack took place near shebaa farms also known as har dov a disputed strip of land between lebanon and syria adjoining the golan heights under israeli control
seven israeli soldiers were injured two of them moderately the idf said
hezbollah which syrian president bashar al assad's regime supports claimed responsibility for the attack
the spanish service member cpl
francisco javier soria toledo was serving with unifil the u.n. interim force in lebanon
he was killed during the incidents that happened between hezbollah and the israeli military the spanish government said
it was unknown whether the peacekeeper thirty six was killed by israeli or hezbollah fire
the idf told cnn it is investigating
unifil said its personnel observed six rockets launched toward israel on wednesday morning and that the idf returned artillery fire in the same general area
during the course of the developments a unifil peacekeeper deployed at a u.n. position near ghajar sustained serious injuries that resulted in his death
the precise cause of death is as yet undetermined and remains the subject of investigation unifil said in a statement
unifil head of mission and force commander major general luciano portolano was in immediate contact with the parties to help control the situation and prevent further escalation
in the meantime at around one thirty p.m. five rockets were fired from the general area of kafer shouba toward israel
the idf fired artillery rounds towards the source of fire
unifil has been informed by the idf that they incurred casualties as a result of fire from the lebanese side
an israeli military position on mount hermon also came under mortar fire wednesday the idf said
israel planned to evacuate civilians wednesday from the town which includes a popular ski resort
a day earlier a rocket attack struck the golan heights and israel responded with artillery fire
overnight the military launched airstrikes against syrian targets in response to hezbollah rocket fire from syrian bases idf spokesman lt. col. peter lerner told cnn
we did this to send a message to the syrian regime that we view it responsible for what occurs on its territory and that there is a price to pay for allowing hezbollah to use your positions lerner said
if the syrians think they are going to open up a new front on the golan after forty years we are not willing to accept that
the golan heights were part of syria until the six day war in one thousand nine hundred and sixty seven
the area has since been under israeli control
israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu warned wednesday that his country is prepared to respond to attacks in the region
at a ceremony in the southern israel city of sderot netanyahu said at this moment the idf is responding to events in the north
to everyone who is trying to challenge us at the northern border i recommend that they look what happened not far away from the city of sderot in gaza
hamas took its hardest hit since its formation
and the idf is prepared to act strongly on all fronts
netanyahu convened a security meeting and vowed those who are responsible for this attack will pay the price
he linked the violence to iran which supports hezbollah and the syrian regime
iran has been attempting for some time through hezbollah to create an additional terror front against us from the golan heights
we are working aggressively and responsibly against this attempt he said
the lebanese government and the assad regime are both responsible for the implications of the attacks that are originating from their territory against israel
we must not provide terrorism with a nuclear umbrella
we must not let the most dangerous regime in the world have the most dangerous weapon in the world the office said
u.n. peacekeepers pulled out of the golan heights in september after islamic militants took some peacekeepers hostage and syrian rebel fighters took control of the border crossing between israel and syria in the syrian town of quneitra
there has been intermittent weapons fire from syria into the golan heights both targeted and errant the israeli military contends as the syrian civil war has raged
more than a week ago iranian semiofficial media reported that an israeli airstrike killed six hezbollah members and a senior iranian commander around quneitra
the israeli military refused to comment about the january eighteen strike
hamas said wednesday it reaffirms hezbollah's right to respond to the israeli aggression especially following the attack in quneitra
hezbollah has claimed responsibility for numerous terrorist attacks
it is blamed for a one thousand nine hundred and eighty three bombing that killed two hundred and forty one u.s. service personnel at a marine compound in beirut lebanon the deadliest attack against u.s. marines since the battle of iwo jima in world war ii
hamas meanwhile came under criticism wednesday from the u.n. special coordinator for the middle east peace process robert serry who said he was outraged by the assault on a u.n. compound in gaza
during a pre announced demonstration of which hamas was well aware a number of protesters climbed the perimeter wall and entered the compound causing damage to united nations premises and property he said
due to precautionary measures taken united nations personnel working in the compound were fortunately unharmed
hamas controls gaza
pending a full transfer of security responsibilities to the legitimate palestinian authority we continue to hold hamas fully responsible for the security and safety of all united nations personnel and operations in gaza serry said
as this serious incident took place in the context of increasing incitement against the united nations in gaza the special coordinator is conducting an urgent review of operations in gaza his statement added

haze episodes have occurred in southeast asia nearly every year since
back in one thousand nine hundred and ninety eight and for years afterwards tan didn't think too deeply about them
yet at some point in his late twenty s he began to wonder
where did the haze come from 
and why did it keep coming back 
air pollution kills around seven million people every year according to the world health organization accounting for one in eight deaths worldwide in two thousand and twelve
the main causes of death were stroke and heart disease followed by chronic obstructive pulmonary disease lung cancer and respiratory infections among children
it is especially bad in the asia pacific region which has a population of over four point two billion and high population density
china and india alone with a combined population of around two point seven billion are both enormous sources and victims of air pollution
in two thousand and ten forty percents of the world's premature deaths caused by air pollution were in china the world's largest emitter of carbon dioxide according to a survey published in the lancet
the university of hong kong's school of public health reported more than three thousand premature deaths in the city in two thousand and thirteen and the situation in many mainland chinese cities is reckoned to be far worse
a poll by the u.s. pew research center found that forty seven percents of chinese citizens thought air pollution to be a very big problem in two thousand and thirteen
it is now a central focus for many chinese environmental groups and a growing source of anxiety for the country's leadership
similar health concerns are building in india where air pollution is now the fifth leading cause of death
between two thousand and two thousand and ten the annual number of premature deaths linked to air pollution across india rose six fold to six hundred and twenty thousand according to the center for science and environment a public interest research and advocacy group in new delhi
in may two thousand and fourteen the who said that new delhi had the worst air of one thousand six hundred cities surveyed worldwide and that rising air pollution had increased the risk of strokes cancers and heart disease
another two thousand and fourteen study has linked a significant drop in india's wheat and rice crop yields to rising levels of two air pollutants black carbon from rural cooking stoves and ground level ozone formed from motor vehicle exhausts industrial emissions and chemical solvents between one thousand nine hundred and eighty and two thousand and ten
in both china and india air pollution is one consequence of a massive exodus from farm to city that has occurred in recent decades
the change has contributed to rising emissions from both vehicles and factories especially coal fired power plants and an emerging middle class that increasingly desires a range of consumer goods that are common in europe and the united states
southeast asia has encountered similar problems in recent decades as its economies and populations have boomed
in fact according to the who nearly one million of the three point seven million people who died from ambient air pollution in two thousand and twelve lived in southeast asia
but on top of smokestacks and tailpipes the region faces an added burden
smoke haze produced in indonesia that is a by product of the world's fifty billion dollar palm oil industry
in the summer of two thousand and thirteen a plane carried tan yi han over the straits of malacca to pekanbaru the capital of riau province the largest palm oil production region in indonesia
tan then a twenty eight year old financial consultant was volunteering with the global environment center a malaysian group that has worked for years to prevent and mitigate haze
he traveled to the heart of neighboring indonesia just after a record breaking haze episode hit peninsular malaysia
on a driving tour in riau he saw endless acres of burned out landscapes
fires had turned swampy peat bogs the area's natural vegetation into land whose parched surface resembled charcoal
these fires are to dry out the peatlands for agricultural uses mainly the cultivation of oil palms
but in some villages fires had even destroyed existing oil palm trees that belonged to multinational companies or local farmers
tan had a memorable encounter in the village of rantau bais
a couple there plied him with tea and snacks then quietly asked if he could spare any of his own food for them
their daughter had developed a respiratory problem because of the haze
the surprise medical bill coupled with the fire destroying their oil palm crops had left the family penniless and hungry
until that moment he had mostly thought of peat blazes as forest fires as they are often called in media reports
but here was a visceral reminder that the fires affect working land and real people
it really touched me said tan
i made a promise to myself that i'd do my best to prevent them from suffering from fires again
it was an issue he felt that required far more public discussion and when the time was right action
i must get more people involved he had thought and turn this into a movement
hazy skies may all look similar but the emissions from any particular source are unique
a factory smokestack in beijing releases a different mix of chemical compounds into the atmosphere than an automobile tailpipe in new delhi does
and the extent of pollution in a given city will depend on how carefully emissions are controlled and how easily they can be dispersed
vehicle and factory emissions have been analyzed for decades in high income countries but haze smoke and its impact on health is not well understood
not many people have investigated it even though it's a very important phenomenon said mikinori kuwata an atmospheric chemist at singapore's nanyang technological university
unlike factory and vehicle emissions wildfire smoke is not regulated by tailpipe scrubbers catalytic converters or other pollution mitigating applications
the composition of the smoke also varies widely according to the type of material that is burning
peatlands for example typically take a longer time to burn than drier matter just as a damp piece of wood takes longer to burn in a campfire
according to the u.s. environmental protection agency peat fires burn at lower temperatures and produce smoke that is more harmful and in larger quantities than the average forest fire or grassland fire does
the emissions from a given peat fire will largely depend on the peat's composition its burning temperature and how far below the ground the fire occurs
but such details aren't yet available in indonesia whose peatlands cover an area roughly the size of the united kingdom
as a result kuwata told me we do not have a very reliable inventory of the country's peatland fire data
kuwata burns indonesian peat in his singapore laboratory to study its chemical properties but his work is limited he said because he can never be sure whether his experiments mirror reality
indonesia has an enormous repository of tropical peatlands and for a generation areas of these have been burned to prepare the land for the cultivation of oil palms
peat smoke now contributes around forty percents of indonesia's overall greenhouse gas emissions
palm oil is an ingredient in a range of consumer products from lipstick to ice cream
yet it has also helped to give its source country the dubious distinction of being the world's third largest greenhouse gas emitter after china and the united states as well as a leading source of hazardous smoke haze
on a summer afternoon the skies were a milky white in riau the indonesian province that produces about a quarter of indonesia's palm oil
my first stop was the headquarters of walhi an ngo in the city of pekanbaru that lobbies the indonesian government for action on haze and other environmental problems
i arrived at walhi's headquarters a low rise residential building near the pekanbaru airport just as a group of farmers and environmental activists were discussing haze over coffee and cigarettes with sri nurhayati qodriyatun a researcher for the secretary general of indonesia's parliament
qodriyatun said her boss had dispatched her to riau to compile a report on haze
at the meeting she explained that according to government estimates forest fires were generally not occurring in areas owned by large plantations
government statements about haze are false
shouted an activist from a local ngo forest rescue riau network
and there's no coordination between ministers they just pass the blame around
the exchange underscored the long running debate across southeast asia about who exactly is responsible for indonesia's peat fires
farmers and environmental groups often accuse companies many of which are headquartered in singapore or malaysia of malfeasance
but many companies say such criticism is overblown and that they have largely reformed their destructive land clearing practices in recent years through voluntary reform initiatives like the roundtable on sustainable palm oil an industry led consortium
whoever is right said qodriyatun the fires have damaged indonesia's international reputation and the indonesian government pays little attention to their health implications in riau and beyond
personally i don't think the government is managing this well she told me after the meeting
usually they just react after the fires start but they should think more about prevention
peat fires though are notoriously hard to predict and extinguish
they start and spread easily and sometimes uncontrollably depending on conditions like wind speed the depth of the soil and the dryness of the air
it's really hard to know how bad a fire will be when it starts said dedy tarsedi a farmer in the riau village of bungaraya
we were sitting in a roadside caf flanked by oil palm trees
tarsedi told me that oil palm is the crop of choice for bungaraya farmers because it is more valuable than paddy rice
a hectare of oil palm he said typically earns a farmer around forty eight million indonesian rupiah per year
paddy rice by contrast brings in just forty million rupiah
but as oil palm cultivation has increased in the village so have fires
and they affect both corporate plantations and smallholder farmers
if a fire happens and we can't control it we'll report it said maman a bungaraya farmer
but sometimes even helicopters are powerless to stop the burning he added
and during the really bad fires a lot of the kids cough and end up at the clinic with health problems
in two thousand and nine indonesia passed a law banning fires on peat plantations
farmers in bungaraya told me that as a result they had started to clear peat bogs manually without using fire
but tarsedi said manual clearance is more labor intensive and requires extra fertilisers
and that he said requires extra time and money that most farmers don't want to part with
when the wind blows from the west smoke can whip east across the straits of malacca and into both singapore and kuala lumpur collectively home to about seven million people
south east asia is not the only place where the burning of vegetation occurs over large areas
most of the world's fires occur in africa and south america
but southeast asia's fires are unique says miriam marlier an atmospheric researcher at columbia university because they occur so close to dense urban centers
there are no comprehensive studies on how repeated exposure to peat smoke affects human health over the long term much less how peat smoke's chemical properties differ from other kinds of biomass smoke
yet emerging research offers early clues
u.s. researchers have found that peat fires in the southern states during the summer of two thousand and eight caused a spike in emergency room visits for heart failure and asthma related respiratory complications
in a follow up study published in june two thousand and fourteen they burned semi charred peat from the fires in the vicinity of lab mice
subsequent pulmonary problems in the mice were mainly linked to coarser grained smoke particles and cardiac problems to finer grained particles
a primary concern from a health perspective is that peat fires tend to generate larger amounts of fine grained particulate matter called pm two point five than normal forest fires
that is worrying mainly because finer grained particles are thought to penetrate further into the bloodstream than coarser ones do posing a potentially higher risk to the heart and other internal organs
finer grained particles are also harder to block with the simple surgical masks that many people in asian cities have traditionally worn as protection against air pollution
a widely cited two thousand and twelve study published in the journal environmental health perspectives estimated that about three hundred and thirty nine thousand deaths between one thousand nine hundred and ninety seven and two thousand and six were associated with landscape fires
about four in five deaths were linked to chronic rather than sporadic exposure
sub saharan africa and southeast asia accounted for one hundred and fifty seven thousand and one hundred and ten thousand deaths respectively and the rate of mortality spiked during years dominated by the el nino weather phenomenon which typically correlates with drier conditions in southeast asia
reducing population level exposure to air pollution from landscape fires is a worthwhile endeavor that is likely to have immediate and measurable health benefits the researchers concluded
another two thousand and twelve study by miriam marlier and other scientists from american and british institutions found that between one and eleven percents of south east asia's population was repeatedly exposed to pollution above the who's recommended air quality levels during sporadic haze episodes between one thousand nine hundred and ninety seven and two thousand and six
elevated exposure during el nino years caused around fifteen thousand cardiovascular linked adult deaths per year the researchers wrote
roughly two thirds of those were linked to fine grained pm two point five particles while the other third were linked to levels of ozone
however there was not enough evidence available to determine exactly how the toxicity of pm two point five in peat fires differed from that of pm two point five emissions in american cities
some scientists suggest that peat smoke's long term effects on humans may be broadly similar to those of urban air pollution which also includes pm two point five particles
no one is sure because so little research has been done to test the theory
rajasekhar balasubramanian an american environmental engineer who studies haze at the national university of singapore speculates that long term exposure to haze episodes could potentially make the population less healthy over time even if people continue to live long lives
in a two thousand and thirteen study he and his colleagues found that the air above singapore during a smoke haze episode contained arsenic chromium cadmium and other carcinogenic elements
they estimated that normal urban levels of pm two point five pollution would cause about twelve out of every million singaporeans to develop cancer over a lifetime but if haze were to occur for ten days per year over seventy straight years the number of likely cancer cases would increase by nearly half
yet there still is no coordinated international effort to analyse haze in a truly interdisciplinary fashion
that is partly due to the sporadic and unpredictable nature of haze balasubramanian said
southeast asia's highly variable weather makes it tricky to predict when haze will appear or where it could spread
he likens a particle of peat smoke to a grasshopper that jumps into the air shoots along horizontally then quickly zooms back to earth only to jump again
another problem balasubramanian said is that the general public does not yet view haze as a serious health threat
people view it as oh yeah it's a problem that occurs in indonesia he told me one afternoon in his office at the national university of singapore
for governments and funding bodies the priority's more mitigation
how to mitigate human exposure to this haze issue rather than to study the problem itself
the task of mitigating pollution is also clouded by politics
countries in southeast asia have little control over what blows across their borders
unlike the european union the association of southeast asian nations lacks the legal authority to force its members to act against their own interests
a case in point is asean's two thousand and two trans boundary haze agreement a non binding document in which the group's ten member states pledged to prevent and monitor peat fires
the agreement called for technology exchanges and other measures to improve regional dialogue and cooperation on haze
it was initially hailed as a landmark achievement but until september two thousand and fourteen indonesia's parliament had refused to ratify it
laode m syarif an environmental lawyer based in the indonesian capital of jakarta said that was mainly because indonesia has long tried to use the haze agreement as a way to leverage singapore into overturning a refusal to extradite indonesian citizens who are wanted for crimes in their homeland
asean tends to view economic development national sovereignty and mutual non interference as its highest priorities said helena varkkey a senior lecturer in the department of international and strategic studies at the university of malaya
in her view asean has taken a mild mannered approach to haze fighting out of deference to powerful palm oil companies many of them based in singapore or malaysia
indeed many analysts have said that indonesia's land concessions areas allocated for commercial plantations are deeply entwined with corruption
a popular joke has it that if indonesia's overlapping concession maps were all counted as national territory the country would grow in size
but companies and officials mostly refuse to share those maps with the public
it's a mess said andika putraditama a research analyst at the jakarta office of the world resources institute a research organization headquartered in washington dc
it's also another reason why indonesia's peatlands continue to burn
against this backdrop tan yi han the singaporean financial consultant and self styled haze activist is hoping to influence the regional debate on haze
in early two thousand and fourteen he founded a citizens organization called people's movement to stop haze or pm haze to kick start the discussion
my gut feeling is we need influence tan said at a sunday evening pm haze meeting
there was only one other participant
putera zenata an indonesian schoolteacher who had joined the group after finding tan online
the venue was zenata's modest apartment in a middle class singapore neighborhood
in june two thousand and fourteen one of tan's hometown newspapers the independent dubbed him singapore's intrepid haze fighter
but pm haze with ten active members and no outside funding is well behind many established advocacy and research groups that fight air pollution elsewhere in asia
in new delhi the center for science and the environment has proposed specific ways that the government could tackle air pollution for example by cracking down on open fires
and in beijing the institute of public and environmental affairs is promoting a pollution monitoring mobile phone app as a way of ramping up pressure on polluting companies
by his own admission tan has very little experience in the non profit sector
he told me that he has no plans to pressure the government or companies into action at least not yet
for the moment he said pm haze is simply trying to learn about the problem in all its complexity and then communicate its findings to the singaporean public
in early november two thousand and fourteen the group developed the content for an informational haze exhibition in singapore that drew an estimated eight hundred visitors
and in the longer term tan said they would like to film a documentary in indonesia
my personal goal is to stop haze by two thousand and twenty three he added casually
that could be a pipe dream
but according to wilson ang assistant director for sustainability at the singapore institute of international affairs the haze of june two thousand and thirteen made the singaporean public much more involved in the issue
along with pm haze the episode spawned the creation of the haze elimination action team another grassroots community group
both groups have since gone on site visits to indonesia opened dialogues with palm oil companies and offered feedback or recommendations to singaporean officials
such a ground up approach is very much welcomed by the government said ang
haze however is still a growing public health concern for many countries especially lower income ones
we put a lot of legislation in place to control point sources and still when you add it up ambient conditions don't get better said jacqueline mcglade chief scientist at the united nations environment program
other challenges she told me are linking air pollution data with research on impacts and holding governments accountable for enforcing pollution laws
more than ever air pollution is a prominent target of policy reforms and public health interventions
many lower income countries grappling with the environmental and health consequences of their booming populations are tightening air pollution standards
international aid and development agencies are also rolling out projects to monitor or regulate particulate emissions
in southeast asia haze has recently resurfaced on asean's political radar
in early july two thousand and fourteen officials from riau province announced that they would conduct a large scale compliance audit of local officials and agroforestry companies linked to peatlands
on august five singapore's parliament passed a law that allows the government to fine both domestic and international companies up to two million dollar singapore for causing or contributing to haze
and on sixteen september indonesia's parliament finally ratified asean's two thousand and two trans boundary haze agreement after twelve years of resistance
also that summer a senior adviser to joko jokowi widodo then indonesia's president elect said the new administration planned to renew the two thousand and nine indonesian law that banned peat burning when it expires in two thousand and fifteen
widodo himself said he planned to streamline land governance by creating a one map forestry policy
the haze is caused both by the people and also the companies he told the straits times a singapore newspaper in late august
if we have good tough law enforcement then it can be resolved
how significant are these developments 
in conversations with several haze watching analysts across south east asia i heard a wide range of opinions
some like helena varkkey aren't especially optimistic mainly because indonesia and asean have so far made so little progress on the haze problem
neither the singaporean law nor the regional haze agreement they pointed out would be enforceable in indonesian courts
and if climate change increases the number of droughts and wildfires around the world as many scientists predict it will the incidence of peatland fires may also rise and pose additional enforcement challenges
but others said it is positive that the indonesian and singaporean governments are at least taking action the sort that could breathe new life into existing indonesian laws designed to tackle haze
the recent political activity gives them hope that annual peat fires will not become southeast asia's status quo for future generations
jokowi did say that he aims to take action against the haze said tan yi han the haze fighter
that's just words but it's better than nothing

no injuries were immediately reported
after the rocket fire officials evacuated israeli controlled areas around mount hermon site of a ski resort the military said
the lebanon based militant group hezbollah is suspected to have been involved in the rocket attack which came from a syrian air base in an area controlled by the syrian army with a known hezbollah presence an israeli military source said on condition of anonymity
hezbollah supports the syrian regime which has been battling sunni islamist militants and other rebels in a civil war for more than three years
weapons fire from syria into israeli controlled golan heights both targeted and errant the israeli military contends has happened intermittently in the past year as the syrian civil war raged
more than a week ago iranian semiofficial media reported that an israeli airstrike killed six hezbollah members and a senior iranian commander in the syrian controlled portion of golan heights around the syrian town of quneitra the site of the only border crossing between israel and syria
iran like hezbollah supports the syrian regime
the israeli military refused to comment about the january eighteen strike
israel has occupied a portion of the territory since seizing it during its one thousand nine hundred and sixty seven war with egypt jordan and syria

the twelve years a slave actor said he was an idiot and devastated at his choice of words during an interview with pbs tavis smiley about the lack of diversity in the british film industry
cumberbatch thirty eight told smiley
i think as far as colored actors go it gets really difficult in the uk and i think a lot of my friends have had more opportunities here in the u.s. than in the uk and that's something that needs to change
his comments were criticized by some observers on twitter as being insensitive and out of touch
one user called sonya thomas asked
benedict cumberbatch used the term coloured to describe black actors
what year are we in 
but smiley who is black defended the sherlock star on monday tweeting
those who saw benedict cumberbatch on pbs know he feels persons of color are underrepresented in hollywood
the actor who appeared on smiley's show to discuss his oscar nominated role in the imitation game praised the efforts of lenny henry a black british actor and comedian who has launched a campaign to ensure more ethnic minorities are employed in the uk media
something's gone wrong we're not being representative enough in our culture of different races and that really does need to step up a pace cumberbatch said
it's clear when you see certain migratory patterns that there are more opportunities here than there are in the uk
cumberbatch issued the following statement to people magazine on monday
i'm devastated to have caused offense by using this outmoded terminology
i offer my sincere apologies
i make no excuse for my being an idiot and know the damage is done
i can only hope this incident will highlight the need for correct usage of terminology that is accurate and inoffensive
the most shaming aspect of this for me is that i was talking about racial inequality in the performing arts in the u.k. and the need for rapid improvements in our industry when i used the term
i feel the complete fool i am and while i am sorry to have offended people and to learn from my mistakes in such a public manner please be assured i have
i apologize again to anyone who i offended for this thoughtless use of inappropriate language about an issue which affects friends of mine and which i care about deeply
read
opinion
cumberbatch misspoke now let's get over it and fight real prejudice
anti racism campaigners in the uk lamented cumberbatch's use of the word as outdated but praised the actor for highlighting a very important issue within the entertainment industry and within society
the lack of representation of people from black and ethnic minority backgrounds within certain industries in the uk is an issue which needs addressing and we are pleased that benedict has spoken out in support of more appropriate representation and of the views of actors and campaigners like lenny henry a spokesperson from show racism the red card told cnn
in doing so he has also inadvertently highlighted the issue of appropriate terminology and the evolution of language
show racism the red card feel that the term coloured is now outdated and has the potential to cause offence due to the connotations associated with the term and its historical usage
appropriate terminology differs from country to country
for example we know that in some countries the term coloured is still widely used and that in the us the term people of colour is quite common

the philippines department of social welfare and development has confirmed that three hundred and forty members of one hundred homeless families were removed from roxas boulevard a major manila thoroughfare and temporarily relocated to a beach resort about ninety kilometers away for the duration of the papal visit
the families returned after the pope's departure
a resolution before the philippines house of representatives has called on the government to summon the head of the dswd for a probe into whether ninety seven thousand six hundred dollar spent on the six day training course at the resort in nasugbu batangas amounted to a misuse of public funds
rep. terry ridon one of the lawmakers behind the resolution said in a statement he was concerned that the families had been rounded up from roxas boulevard which the papal convoy traveled several times during the pope's january fifteen nineteen visit
he said the episode highlighted the frivolous manner in which the government implemented anti poverty programs
the training course at the resort had been been funded as part of a program with the objective of keeping families off the streets by training them how to live in a house read the resolution which was also sponsored by rep. antonio tinio and rep. isagani zarate
however after the papal visit the families who participated in the training were returned to the streets raising questions about the program's effectiveness in terms of its supposed objective of reducing poverty said the resolution
in an unrelated senate hearing tuesday dswd secretary dinky soliman was asked about the issue and confirmed that homeless families from the boulevard had been sent to the resort
she said the department had already intended to enroll the families in the training program and had considered the period of the pope's visit would be the ideal time to do so
to prepare for pope francis arrival
local governments wanted to make sure that roxas boulevard was in a secure and safe state and so were the people
with the influx of people in the area she told the hearing
so when we reached out to the families on roxas boulevard since we were already planning to register them to the modified conditional cash transfer program we thought it could be the right time to hold the orientation from january fifteen to nineteen
the government's modified conditional cash transfer program is described on a government website as a complete package of assistance to street families
with access to social services and economic opportunities for the improvement of their living conditions
ridon's resolution alleged that the resort stay was not the first time that dswd made an attempt to cover up the massive inequality in the country
it claimed that during the world economic forum on east asia held in manila in may last year families were relocated to another resort for similar training
the plight of the poor particularly street children was a touchstone during pope francis visit to the predominantly catholic country
at a sunday mass the pope embraced former street children who asked him why god had allowed them to suffer

at a news conference in mexico city tuesday murillo karam said ninety nine suspects have been detained so far
authorities have also obtained hundreds of testimonies confessions and pieces of evidence
these and other elements we found during the investigation allowed us to carry out an analysis about the logical causes and without a doubt we can conclude that the students at the teachers college were abducted killed burned and thrown into the san juan river in that order murillo karam said
as to why they were killed toms zern de lucio the head of mexico's criminal investigations agency said it was a case of mistaken identity
in other words the criminal group accused of executing the students thought they belonged to a rival gang also operating around the town of iguala where the students were last seen

we can conclude that the motivation was consistent the students were identified by the criminals as members of an organized crime rival group that operated in the region
that was the reason why they were deprived of their freedom initially and then of their lives zern de lucio said
former iguala mayor jose luis abarca has been charged in the case and is awaiting trial as the accused mastermind of the abduction and execution of the forty three students
authorities say he wanted to prevent the students from disrupting an event by his wife the night they went missing
the students were believed to have been captured by iguala police and turned over to a gang
there is no indication that abarca wanted them all dead authorities said but the gang mistook them for a rival group and executed them
abarca's wife maria de los angeles pineda has also been charged
the case has caused an uproar in mexico with countless protests and demonstrations which at times turned violent
at a news conference tuesday the parents of the students refused to believe authorities even suggesting the mexican military might've been behind the disappearance of the young men
the students attending a rural teachers college were left wing anti government activists mostly in their late teens and early twenties
murillo karam categorically denied the army had anything to do with the case saying there weren't even enough soldiers in the area at the time of the disappearance to abduct and execute forty three students
part of the problem is that so far the remains of only one student have been positively identified and parents are asking what happened to the other forty two
but the head of the criminal investigations agency says the remains were so badly burned that extracting dna samples for identification is now impossible
the ashes were thrown into the nearby san juan river
the dental remains found in what was the middle of the fire show that the temperature reached one thousand six hundred degrees celsius which dehydrated decomposed intervened and fused the remains
this makes it impossible to extract dna samples even with the most advanced technology zern de lucio said
at a public event mexico's president said tuesday it's time to turn the page

indonesia's search and rescue agency basarnas will continue its work to try to retrieve bodies from the wreckage site in the java sea the head of the agency bambang soelistyo said wednesday
the military provided the majority of personnel and hardware involved in the recovery operation which was hindered by bad weather and technical problems
we are really disappointed imam sampurno whose four family members who were on the plane still haven't been found said of the military's announcement
we really hope the evacuation process is still going
basarnas said it would have sixty divers eight salvage experts seven boats two helicopters and a fixed wing plane taking part in the continued search efforts which will resume saturday after the teams take a rest
flight qz eight thousand five hundred and one went down on december twenty eight as it flew from the indonesian city of surabaya toward singapore with one hundred and sixty two people on board
so far searchers have managed to recover seventy bodies from the sea leaving ninety two still unaccounted for
over the weekend navy divers tried to lift part of the fuselage of the plane using wire ropes and giant balloons
but the attempts failed after lines attached to the wreckage broke
an effort to lift a smaller piece of wreckage was also unsuccessful the military said
our main priority is to find the bodies
we are not going to focus on lifting the fuselage soelistyo said wednesday about the future search plans
the chief of the indonesian armed forces gen. moeldoko on tuesday ordered the military teams involved in the operation to pull out said military spokesman manahan simorangkir
officials said that nineteen of the eighty one navy divers working on the recovery efforts had fallen ill with decompression sickness and would be taken for treatment at a hospital in jakarta the capital
i told them safety first
but as we know soldiers they are always working hard to find the bodies said rear adm. widodo commander of the indonesian navy's western fleet
they are not thinking about safety but about doing their duty
the divers haven't been able to see any more bodies inside the wreckage of the fuselage widodo said
officials had previously suggested that many of the missing human remains might be found inside the fuselage
but widodo said some bodies could be trapped or hidden under wreckage on the seafloor
searchers have recovered at least fourteen bodies from the fuselage site including some that floated free during attempts to lift the wreckage according to officials
indonesian aviation investigators are still trying to establish why flight qz eight thousand five hundred and one went down in an area of heavy thunderstorms last month while other planes nearby completed their journeys safely
investigators are looking at whether the aircraft's flight augmentation computers played a role in what went wrong the news agency reuters reported tuesday citing two unidentified people familiar with the matter
the fac helps pilots with the stability and control of the aircraft keeping it on course at the proper altitude and making sure adjustments to the rudder are smooth
it also warns pilots if they try to manually push the plane beyond its capabilities
flight qz eight thousand five hundred and one an airbus a three hundred and twenty two hundred had two facs one serving as a backup
indonesian officials have said the aircraft climbed rapidly before it fell into the water
the reason for the sharp ascent is unclear but aviation analysts say the fac could have recognized trouble and at a critical moment automatically shifted full control back to the pilots who may not have realized it amid the crisis
investigators have submitted their preliminary report into the crash officials said tuesday
but authorities have said they don't plan to release it to the public
indonesian transportation minister ignasius jonan told cnn on monday that the final report into the disaster should be published in less than a year
it won't be a year that's my promise he said

after two years of fundraising and wrestling with government bureaucracy rodrigues arrived at a place some might call a version of eden
the alto turiacu reserve where the awa guaja roam
i wanted to show the daily life in the world's most endangered tribe he said
the awa guaja's way of life is being threatened by relentless loggers who are illegally encroaching on their land according to brazil's national indian foundation
many awa indians have had little to no contact with the outside world but that is beginning to change the foundation reports as loggers continue to destroy the forests their existence depends on
rodrigues set out to document the tribe's existence pure pristine and tragically fleeting
i had traveled to africa and other remote places where people at least knew what a camera was rodrigues said
here i was in the twenty one st century with other humans who had never seen a camera a computer
never seen a shower and were shocked when they saw a helicopter
and yet they are extremely happy
calling themselves awa tupi guarani for man the tribe is made of forest foragers and dexterous hunters
challenges abound said rodrigues who was forced to communicate with hand gestures for several weeks because the tribespeople did not speak portuguese
i pointed this way to say the sun is setting and made hand signs to ask questions about hunting rodrigues recalled
they were incredibly friendly and i was very well received
spending weeks without uttering words rodrigues immersed himself in the visual resplendence of the awa guaja life in the forest
twelve hour hunting expeditions were common cutting through thick jungle growth during the monsoon rains
nature's orchestral sounds rang behind every moment something his photographs seem to allude to
detouring from the use of formal portraiture often seen in ethnophotography rodrigues black and white photos are filled with an honesty that could only come as a result of an amicable pact with his subjects
the awa clearly trusted rodrigues camera and in the resulting work we can clearly see how well versed he became with the ins and outs of the awa way of life
the cinematic quality of some of the shots in the hunting scenes is a testament to the photographer's endurance and appreciation of a highly spiritual form of sportsmanship
we walked and walked for hours slashing through the forest overgrowth to look for the prey rodrigues said
the awa were barefoot the whole time
rodrigues nonchalantly talked about a dangerous situation while hunting for the indigenous red puma
the hunter had missed a shot and the puma jumped right over towards me he said
in the meantime i was having an allergic reaction to a spider bite
it wasn't easy
there are several groups of the awa guaja in this part of the forest
some have been known to exist since the one thousand nine hundred and seventy s. others have been contacted in the early one thousand nine hundred and eighty s. many are believed to still be in hiding
earlier this month brazil's official news agency reported that three isolated awa indians had made contact with the other mainstream awa guaja
the group's leader amakaria reportedly said that loggers were marking trees and threatening to kill them
the brazilian government has launched a massive military operation into the states of para and maranhao today the epicenter in the war between loggers and indians
latest satellite imagery shows that new logging tracks are constantly being carved
monitoring and preserving such a large expanse of tropical forest is a challenge
in the meantime how can the so called civilized world understand what is being lost 
getting out of my comfort zone my comfortable bed to walk for hours through virgin forest crossing rivers and rapids with water up to my neck
hearing the triumphal songs of the hunters as they walked home a large prey to share with their brethren this experience can completely change a human being

but remaining relatively untouched for all those years has had an unintended effect on this two hundred and fifty kilometer long four kilometer wide no man's land
home to five rivers and several mountains it's become a thriving natural habitat for thousands of plant and animal species
and if south korea has its way the dmz will eventually be transformed into an ecology peace park
the proposal is high on seoul's agenda at this week's ramsar convention an international meeting on wetlands taking place in switzerland
a korean delegation to the standing committee meeting of the ramsar convention will brief international organization officials about the dmz peace park plan to seek cooperation said an official of the ministry of unification the government office responsible for inter korean relations in a korea times report
it aims to broaden international support for the project added the official
apart from the thousands of soldiers stationed at the dmz the heavily fortified border is home to more than one thousand two hundred varieties of plants and thousands of animal species including endangered wildlife like the asiatic black bear and amur leopard
it's not the first time the idea to turn the dmz into an ecology park has been raised
the south korean government first introduced the plan in two thousand and thirteen
it brought it up again in an official statement in two thousand and fourteen saying the park could become a symbol of peace between the two koreas
the south's ministry of unification even listed it as one of its new year plans for two thousand and fourteen
so why enlist the international community's assistance 
as the southern part of dmz is under the control of the united nations command it is important for seoul to gain global support for the dmz park plan reports the korea times
but the biggest challenge will be to persuade north korea to get on board with the plan
pyongyang has repeatedly rejected the idea dismissing it as an attempt to make money off tourists

the word on the street or on the internet at least is that plans are afoot to develop an erotic entertainment attraction on the island's southwest coast national scenic area
after interest was aroused by details posted on the region's official website however the page was quickly taken down
the park's administration director cheng rong fong confirmed with cnn that the proposal is real but he insists it's just a concept at this point
the ideal plan is to realize the proposal within this year if we can gain support from the local government said cheng
details of the plan circulated by a user on taiwan's popular ptt online bulletin board outlined a taiwan romantic boulevard sightseeing route with four zones stretching across three counties
each stage has a different theme
dating paradise scenic spot for wedding gowns silk road of love and a proposed ten thousand meter square sex theme park
the sex theme park or garden of eden as it's called in the proposal will be modeled after other erotic parks around the world including jeju's loveland in south korea and vigeland park in oslo norway
claiming to be educational the park will serve as the final stop of the four stage journey of love
it'll be divided into different sections covering topics including sex positions unusual sex lives and sex toys
the dating paradise is perfect for those who are more than friends but aren't officially a couple yet the proposal said
cheng said that the proposal shouldn't have been made public before being finalized but insisted if realized that it will help regenerate a neglected area
the southwestern coast of taiwan has been an important salt farm since the qing dynasty he says
it has a unique background culture and ecological value
yet a decade after it was declared a national scenic area it still hasn't received much attention from tourists
so we thought to ourselves is it time to try a new mode of thinking 
the white powdery salt hill and salt farm have always emitted a romantic feeling for visitors coming to the area said cheng
that's why we came up with the idea to be the first dating wedding themed park in taiwan
this is the first time i find a government proposal interesting said one online critic according to taiwan's now news
another said
we surpass japan
the pride of taiwan
this is too out of line posted another
and soon the government will start promoting sex tourism
chang huang chen the deputy commissioner for yunlin county the sex park's proposed home told the taipei times that the idea may not be suitable for traditional minded locals
cheng said he'd received mostly supportive comments but he welcomed different opinions
sex has always been a taboo in chinese society he added
but it's a part of our lives and a very natural thing why can't we discuss it openly and generously 
aside from the sex park the rest of the proposal makes use of existing attractions
we're planning to add around one hundred landmarks and installations to each of stage to enrich the experience said cheng
the proposed route starts at the scenic six story high salt hill in cigu county
it then leads to beimen a place famous for its vibrant pre wedding photo shooting industry where churches and dozens of other romantic landmarks are built for that purpose
the third destination budai is a fishing town in chiayi
the proposal calls it the right place to take your oath before heading to the sex theme park

the rush of fear and the brief re acquaintance with breakfast are part of the thrill
but when does a theme park ride stop being scarily fun and start being just plain scary 
we're talking about the rides on which the fear turns into the kind of pure psychological terror that only weeks of counseling or a night of martinis can resolve
the rides on which it's not just breakfast that flashes before your eyes but your entire life
these are the scariest theme park rides on earth
thankfully we don't have to try them because stefan zwanzger aka the globetrotting theme park guy already has
and lived to tell the tale
just when life in a totalitarian state couldn't get any more terrifying north korea unleashes some creaking fairground rides on its unsuspecting citizenry
to be fair the kaeson youth park is a rare attempt to sprinkle genuine joy on the gray stalinist cityscape of pyongyang
the fear here says zwanzger is an emotional response in no way soothed by geopolitics
when you visit north korea you naturally never feel completely safe and relaxed so you enter the rides wondering if they've been maintained at all since most were built decades ago
zwanzger's fear free alternative
kaeson has a relatively new italian made zamperla coaster
most ghost trains are so lame that it's interesting to hear of one that actually does spook its passengers
unfortunately at the time of zwanzger's visit this boardwalk ride on baku's caspian seafront was getting its screams the lazy way
via pain
imagine you're alone in a ghost train driving through the dark and all of a sudden a sticky curtain drops on you from above and sticks itself to your nose and teeth zwanzger says
and while the ghost train keeps moving forward the curtain and your nose and teeth don't
zwanzger says he complained to the operator
due to the language barrier and the lack of any internationally recognized sign language for my nose got stuck to a curtain i don't think he got the message
i don't think he really cared about anything either
he adds
man that was painful
my love and pity goes out to those who ride it next
at iran's eram park it's a tossup between which is more disturbing
the badly drawn mickey mouse cartoons or the soda can roller coaster 
for zwanzger the coaster which plays fast and loose with physics by flinging passengers in a such a tight loop they can almost see the backs of their own heads wins
when i saw this the first time with coke can shaped cars hurtling noisily around a narrow loop i thought that's going to hurt
and it did
two to three hours of neck pain followed
this roller coaster makes one of the narrowest loopings known to mankind
it's as if your head stays in the same place while the coaster spins around
zwanzger's fear free alternative
skip roller iran's coasters altogether and enjoy the country and its wonderful people
fill it with starry eyed couples and happy families
then crank the speed dial up to eleven
that's how they do it in nepal
because maybe when you live on the slopes of the himalayas gaining a few extra meters in height just isn't thrilling enough
that thing had speed says zwanzger who says he didn't board the wheel in kathmandu's fun park because the line was too long and he was afraid of being propelled into orbit
you could hear screams
and these were not the normal ferris wheel screams of ooooh let's take a photo 
these were more like argghhh let me down i wan na get outta here screams
chairoplanes are called chairoplanes because as with chairs it's possible to sit in them and as with planes all logic says these things should not leave the ground
typically chairoplanes rise a few meters off the ground giving passengers a thrill as they ride in a chair or model aircraft attached by chains to a rotating overhead gantry
at fantawild a new theme park in the chinese coastal city of qingdao the chairoplane ride is less chair more plane lofting startled passengers up to almost cruising altitude
i was the only rider and once up in the air the chains were making creaking and groaning noises and my chair was turning wildly on its own axis says zwanzger
it was a long ride
and cold
it was new so maybe my fear was just psychological but i'd rather fly a plane from the one thousand nine hundred and seventy s than get back in that qingdao chairoplane
zwanzger's fear free alternative
any chairoplane in a european theme park with a budget of more than one hundred million euros
there is of course nothing remotely scary about a kid compatible classic that takes passengers on a mini tour of a world populated by friendly animatronic puppets
and yet says zwanzger disneyland's it's a small world ride as seen in its u.s. french japanese and hong kong parks has untapped potential as a psychological weapon
one ride is fun but try it about six or seven times and it becomes one of the scariest rides on earth
you ask yourself what if i was trapped here listening to that song and seeing these puppets forever 
if you were to chain someone in this ride and have them go around over and over i think it would actually break them
like many unnecessary things assembled in the one thousand nine hundred and eighty s among them the cadillac cimarron and mid career films of sylvester stallone the cannonball loop must've seemed like a good idea at the time
looking back however it's hard not to view it as the work of an unhinged mind
it enjoyed a brief life in the summer of one thousand nine hundred and eighty five at the now defunct action park in vernon new jersey before being shut down in one thousand nine hundred and ninety six reportedly after a series of accidents
i've been to almost three hundred theme and water parks now but this is by far the scariest thing i've ever seen says zwanzger
looking at it it's just so obvious that if you have one wrong move you're going to experience a lot of pain or get trapped inside
i can't believe this was actually built in the united states the country where you can be sued by anyone for just about anything

that's my favorite part of the circus dutch photographer wiesje peels said
when there's a moment five minutes before get on and five minutes after they get off
peels fascination with the circus began as a child
her father traveled europe as a one man show theatro picollini performing at hospitals and amusement parks
at six years old peels began helping her father as the magician's assistant
for five years she watched her father walk a tightrope between being her dad and performing as a magician
it's what the majority of peels work focuses on something she calls in between worlds
in two thousand and one peels traveled to india to follow and photograph a large ship
but instead she felt a calling to run away with the great bombay circus
starkly different from her father's small production the circus boasted multiple tents and more than one hundred performers
she photographed the show for two weeks
at first she shot the expected the splendor of the circus act
but it wasn't the whimsy on stage that truly appealed to peels artistry
she became interested in the evolution that occurred behind the curtain
her book mimus binds together roughly one hundred photographs taken at several traveling circuses in europe
the images capture a glimpse of the hidden life of the performing artist
the performers carry a certain melancholy when transitioning in and out of character
this is illustrated clearly in peels photo of a clown
he's still in costume his makeup still intact yet he's off stage no longer part of an act
he emanates an unavoidable authenticity peels says
peels work is heavily influenced by other artwork specifically nineteen th century paintings
before photographing every circus she visits local museums to derive inspiration
but the true genius lies in her ability to relate to the performer
she finds herself in between worlds too
there's the home life and the artist life peels says
as a wife and a mother of two peels says she struggles to find time to create and she often seeks solace at artist residencies to focus solely on her work
now she's in zundert netherlands the birthplace of vincent van gogh in an effort to draw space to become a character of her own
i live in two worlds she said
so do you



five foreigners one american one french citizen and three people from tajikistan were killed in the attack essam al naas said
five libyans were killed
the libyan branch of isis claimed responsibility for the attacks and released photos of the two gunmen it said had carried out the attacks as abu ibraheem al tunsi and abu sulaiman al sudani
their naming convention indicates that the men were of tunisian and sudanese origin respectively
al naas said it appears the attackers were libyans
american contractor david berry was among the people killed in a terrorist attack at the corinthia hotel in tripoli libya on tuesday according to cliff taylor chief executive officer of crucible a security firm where berry was working
the fbi is expected to open an investigation into the incident two u.s. officials told cnn
a state department official confirmed the death of a u.s. citizen but would provide no further information
a french citizen was among those killed according to the french foreign ministry
al naas earlier said at least two libyan security personnel had been killed in the attack and that three gunmen were holed up in the hotel
an online group that supports isis said the attack was carried out in the name of abu anas al libi
al libi was an alleged al qaeda operative accused of involvement in the bombing of u.s. embassies in africa
he was captured by u.s. special forces in libya
he died in a u.s. hospital this month
a spokesman for the corinthia group in malta told cnn there had not been a hostage situation in the hotel as some reports suggested
we are trying to take possession of the hotel back to assess the damage he said but libyan security forces were not yet allowing that
the attack began when militants detonated a car bomb in the parking lot of the hotel
the gunmen then shot their way into the hotel
guests were evacuated to safety however
the five star hotel is popular among government officials some of whom reside there
a witness to the events told cnn that all roads leading to the corinthia hotel had been sealed by security forces
people were warned to stay away the witness said adding that there had been exchanges of gunfire

share your view of the asteroid
nasa images released monday reveal the asteroid officially known as two thousand and four bl eighty six has its own small moon
the grainy black and white photos show the asteroid about a third of a mile in size spinning through space with its two hundred and thirty foot wide moon trailing behind
asteroid two thousand and four bl eighty six came about seven hundred and forty five thousand miles from earth or about three times as far away as the moon just after eleven a.m
et monday according to nasa
it was far enough that it didn't pose a threat to earth but close enough to give scientists and amateurs a chance to observe a large asteroid up close
it was the closest known asteroid this large to pass near earth until two thousand and twenty seven when an asteroid called one thousand nine hundred and ninety nine an ten flies by
observers on the ground didn't see much when the asteroid was closest to earth monday morning because it wasn't at its brightest
only a portion of its illuminated side was visible according to sky and telescope magazine
the asteroid brightened as it got farther from the earth because its face became more fully illuminated the magazine said
the best chance for viewing was from eight p.m
et monday to one a.m
et tuesday
nasa scientists snapped radar generated images of the asteroid using the deep space network antenna at goldstone california and the arecibo observatory in puerto rico
while it poses no threat to earth for the foreseeable future it's a relatively close approach by a relatively large asteroid so it provides us a unique opportunity to observe and learn more don yeomans the recently retired manager of nasa's near earth object program office at the jet propulsion laboratory in pasadena california said in a nasa news release
yeomans retired on january nine after sixteen years of tracking asteroids
paul chodas has been designated as the new manager
we should be getting some great radar images of this asteroid chodas told cnn before the asteroid passed
radar would be the key to study the asteroid's surface give an idea of its shape whether it has rocks and that kind of stuff on it
it'll be really exciting
observers without binoculars or a scope watched from their computers on the virtual telescope project two point zero
the asteroid was discovered on january thirty two thousand and four by a telescope of the lincoln near earth asteroid research survey in white sands new mexico

it is the second purported message from goto in four days
if authentic it is the first time isis is publicly linking the fates of goto and the captive jordanian pilot moaz al kassasbeh whom isis captured after his jet crashed last month in syria
the latest file posted to youtube and distributed on social media by known isis supporters appears to show a static image of goto alone in handcuffs and wearing orange holding a picture of who appears to be al kassasbeh
over the image a voice purporting to be goto's restates saturday's apparent isis proposal
goto would go free if jordan releases longtime prisoner sajida al rishawi
this time it's still a one for one swap but now both the lives of goto and the jordanian pilot are threatened if it doesn't go through
cnn can not independently verify the authenticity of tuesday's message
i've been told this is my last message and i've also been told that the barrier obstructing my freedom is now just the jordanian government delaying the handover of sajida the voice says in english in tuesday's post
tell the japanese government to put all the political pressure on jordan
her for me a straight exchange the voice says
any more delays by the jordanian government will mean they are responsible for the death of their pilot which will then be followed by mine
i only have twenty four hours left to live and the pilot has even less
the nearly two minute video posted tuesday morning et makes no mention of releasing pilot al kassasbeh even if al rishawi is released
the video is similar to a post from saturday which alleged that isis had killed a different japanese hostage haruna yukawa
saturday's post shows a static image of goto holding what appears to be a photo of beheaded compatriot yukaka
a voice purporting to be goto's says that yukawa was killed because japan hadn't answered a previous isis demand of two hundred million dollar for the japanese captives freedom
saturday's voice also said that the captors no longer demanded money but rather a goto for al rishawi swap
japanese prime minister shinzo abe said sunday that experts were analyzing saturday's video but that it seemed highly credible
u.s. authorities said they had no reason to doubt its authenticity
abe on wednesday morning told reporters in tokyo that he was angry about the ongoing situation
under very severe circumstances i instructed yet again that the government work together as one towards the immediate release of mr. goto he said
al rishawi is an iraqi woman facing the death penalty in jordan for her role in a series of bombings that killed dozens of people at hotels in the arab kingdom in two thousand and five
authorities said she tried to take part in the massacre but her explosives failed
militants say they captured al kassasbeh the jordanian pilot after he ejected from his crashing f sixteen last month having taken part in u.s. led coalition airstrikes near isis de facto capital raqqa syria
jordan is participating in an american led mission against isis an organization seeking to establish a caliphate or islamic state and has wrested territory spanning from central syria to about one hundred kilometers north of baghdad
goto forty seven and yukawa forty two had gone to the middle east for different reasons the former is an experienced freelance journalist covering the conflict in iraq and syria and the latter an aspiring security contractor who felt at home in the war torn region
they ended up in the hands of isis in recent months

the thirty one year old lee happily shows off her winning display telling visitors how much fun she had making the bag with her partner a local design college student
the hardest part was sewing the bottle cap on she said
i researched different types of bags
sometimes you need a bigger bag if you want to put more things inside
walk around the room and the exhibition is full of discarded items wine boxes cd covers and straws now reborn as pen holders notepads and lamps
in a sense lee and the fifteen or so people involved with the project have been neglected in one way or another by hong kong society all of these people have struggled to get by because they all have intellectual disabilities
despite the pride she has for her daughter lee's mother worries about her
her character is too simple and warm
i'm worried she will get hurt and sometimes she has to be careful about what she says
people living with down syndrome are often stuck with menial jobs
but this exhibition run by the local salvation army gave lee and others the chance to learn a new skill partner with a local student to reinvent trash into treasure all in an effort to raise disability awareness
in chinese superstition people with disabilities have been associated with bad luck that the disability was a punishment for the wrongdoings of an ancestor
many lived in hiding encountering discrimination and slurs advocates say
but increasingly people are finding ways to counter misconceptions and bring people with disabilities into the mainstream
it's an experience that heidi hui a social work professor at the university of hong kong and mother of a daughter with down syndrome knows well
hui explains that traditionally disabled people are seen as an outcast something that is no good
there is a chinese saying that it must be the family who is doing something wrong
in the older days they were saying that it's a kind of punishment
hui recalled that when she and other parents of children opened their first center for the down syndrome association more than twenty years ago the windows were broken and they couldn't use the elevator because neighbors didn't want them there
the group responded by holding workshops with residents to explain and dispel myths about down syndrome
a few years later the group was finally allowed to use the elevator and the workshops no longer became necessary
although information about disability is now widely available some of that stigma exists today
catrin anderson is a fifteen year old with cerebral palsy who requires round the clock care
she can't move but she can see and hear
she often has to deal with strangers talking about her in front of her
her mother kim anderson originally from britain said
the difficult thing with catrin is that if she is in company and people are talking about her she's understanding everything they're saying
to combat this problem she made a sign in english and chinese telling people she can see and hear
for anderson the key to change in attitudes is integration
that's maybe what we're still not doing enough of in hong kong maybe in schools and getting people like catrin
out and about in society because until they're in society society is not going to fully understand or appreciate them
the census department estimates that about ten percents of the city's population has physical or intellectual disabilities based on on figures from two thousand and fourteen
at another photo exhibition featuring people with disabilities calib lee a nineteen year old with down syndrome strikes a taekwondo pose in his green belt
his father peter lee said he believes attitudes are changing
more and more people with disabled child or children the parents will take them outside to encounter the whole world let them learn let them go to school and not just hide the disabled child or children in hong kong
nowadays more and more parents love or like to do that
frank freeman photographed lee and other young people with down syndrome as models for his exhibition entitled the purest people
he photographed young people showing off their hobbies such as acting dancing and swimming
there have been efforts around the globe to be more inclusive of people with down syndrome including target ads in the united states featuring child models and a tv ad by british department store marks and spencer's 
two years ago freeman started volunteering with the down syndrome association and realized part of the problem was that people didn't know how to talk to those with the condition and that they were often treated as patients instead of people
he said that the aim of the exhibition was to show a more playful side of people with down syndrome
they just want to love and be involved in making people happy he said

a british transport minister on a trade visit to taipei got an embarrassing lesson in the perils of diplomatic gift giving monday when she presented a pocket watch to the city's mayor a taboo act in chinese culture

but fill that boulevard with thousands of javanese out for the sunday stroll and you soon realize he is no ordinary indonesian
jokowi
they shout using the nickname by which the country's new president is universally referred reaching out to him for handshakes and selfies
in october he took office as president of this enormous pacific archipelago of about two hundred and fifty million people the largest muslim majority country in the world
indonesia is a big country
we have seventeen thousand islands and it is not easy to manage that he told cnn's christiane amanpour in an exclusive interview sunday speaking a mixture of english and bahasa indonesia
he has made the blusukan an unannounced visit with the people a trademark of his political brand
blusukan is go to the people go to the ground he told amanpour as he walked his bike through crowds in central jakarta
we check our program we consult our program and we must know the real situation the ground
to the detriment of his bodyguards stress levels he makes these visits at least once a week
it is a rare sight for any world leader let alone one who leads a country with a history of violent separatist movements
his security team allows the president to be jostled by young and old elbowing in for a handshake
later at a slum that he's transformed into new low cost housing an elderly woman walks right up to the president
she asked my number telephone number
he says
things are getting a little too friendly says amanpour with a smile
widodo was raised in a down and out area of the central java city of surakarta known as solo
his father was a carpenter and he followed in his footsteps becoming a furniture exporter
his rise to power was unusual he has no history with the military or the elite unlike the country's former presidents
he rose to prominence through his extremely popular tenures as mayor of solo and then governor of jakarta
his musical tastes too are unusual for a head of state
as heavy metal blared through his car's speakers widodo slapped his thigh in rhythm with the song and told amanpour that some of his favorite bands include led zeppelin and metallica
amanpour raised his upbringing as they stood overlooking the former slum
i know the situation
i know the condition he says
because when i was little when i was a boy i stayed the riverbank in the slum area
in southeast asia's largest garment market narrow hallways lined with stalls become impassable as seemingly everyone in the florescent lit building pours in for a chance to see jokowi
he stops to buy twenty sarongs for gifts in the office he says from a salesman who struggles to contain his giddy excitement
indonesia has had trouble breaking into the global marketplace that has transformed many of its asian neighbors like china
indonesia is a big country
and i want my people prosperous he says
it's not easy but i want it
his challenges are many
indonesia's gross domestic product growth has been slowing
shortly after widodo took office the world bank said the country's growth rate was the lowest it had been for five years
i am sure that with fiscal changes that we have enacted by and dealing with infrastructure and providing opportunity for investment whether local or foreign investments i am sure that we will grow better this year between
if conditions are right within three years he says gdp growth could be more than seven percents
but we have to work hard he says
in his first one hundred days widodo did something his predecessors have tried and failed to enact
a cut in the enormous fuel subsidies the government offers
in the late one thousand nine hundred and ninety s protests over fuel prices kindled an uprising that led to the resignation of the dictator suharto
with the cut in fuel subsidies the savings to government has been around two hundred and thirty trillion rupiah widodo says promising more for his infrastructure health and education plans
his vision is to curtail the use of government money to promote consumption of fossil fuels and instead use funds to bolster the country's desperately lacking health and education systems and infrastructure
to build our infrastructure
to improve the irrigation for the farmer seed and fertilizer to the farmer
and then we give to the fishermen we give refrigerators to the fishermen
and we give working capital to small in the villages
so from the consumption to the production
from the consumptive activities to the productive activities
two months after taking office airasia flight qz eight thousand five hundred and one crashed in indonesian waters with one hundred and sixty two people on board
i don't know why the plane went down the president told amanpour
it can be because of the weather it can be because of other reasons
we are not sure about that now
but the most important thing is that the operation was conducted quickly and we are continuing the removal of bodies from the ocean floor
a preliminary report is due out this week
last week the country's transportation minister said the plane had climbed rapidly and stalled before it crashed into the sea
airasia is a malaysian carrier but indonesia has long had a troubled airline industry and regulatory system
so dangerous is the country's industry that only five indonesia airlines are permitted to fly within the european union more than sixty others are banned as of november
what we want to fix is the system
we are going to fix this he says
but the of system administration is not related to the airline accidents
airasia flight qz eight thousand five hundred and one was not licensed to fly its route from surabaya indonesia to singapore on the day it took off
there is no relation he insisted between the regulatory system and the crash
as the world's largest muslim majority nation and democracy indonesia is often held up as a beacon of moderation
since the killings of seventeen people in france this month the world has turned its focus to radical islam in a greater way perhaps than any time since nine eleven
the world in some way is looking to this country among others to hold the line
most of the world's muslims are not arab and indonesia is a case in point
there is no compromise for violence
no compromise
and we really condemn that
but we also need to respect each other respect other religions among people between individuals we have to respect each other widodo says
differences can be a beauty
it's not going to be something that's scary
the country has had its bouts with violent islamism a two thousand and two al qaeda affiliated attack in bali that left two hundred and two dead and a long running but now diminished islamic separatist movement in aceh
between two hundred and fifty and three hundred indonesians have gone to fight with isis and other extremist groups in syria widodo says
the number is really small he points out for a population with a quarter billion people
we have a good experience in handling radicalism and extremism through not only security approach but also cultural and religious approach
in indonesia we have big moderate islamic organizations widodo says
those organizations are the ones who teach moderate islam islam that has got good tolerance toward any other religions
and thanks be to god that in indonesia at present this process going well
the security approach doesn't solve the problem will not solve the problem
but religious approach cultural approach going to lessen a lot
some analysts worry that radical islamist organizations in indonesia may relish the training ground syria has provided
there are some people who went using fake or forged passports but they arrested in our airports widodo says
we want indonesia to be an example of moderate islam islam that has tolerance good islam
and i am sure that we are able to do so
in indonesia islam and democracy can go together
indonesia can be a land of ruthless politics
three months into his term widodo was facing his first big administrative crisis
his choice for police chief budi gunawan was a favorite of the head of his political party and benefactor former president megawati sukarnoputri
days after widodo announced the nomination gunawan was indicted by the country's anti corruption commission
in apparent retaliation police arrested the deputy chief of the country's anti corruption body
these events have rocked and gripped the country the subject of protests and daily page one newspaper stories
our commitment still is to eradicate corruption widodo tells amanpour through an interpreter
and we have to also use the presumption of innocence principle
because of the corruption investigation he says gunawan's inauguration as chief despite overwhelming approval of parliament has been delayed
everybody has to be mature in looking at it as a legal process and the president is not allowed to intervene
this is a legal process
the rise of a nonmilitary politician may have given hope to those who wanted a dovish president but widodo's approach to drug smugglers on death row has been cold comfort
in december he announced that he would reject clemency requests for sixty four inmates sentenced to die
six prisoners were killed by firing squad this month including five foreigners
brazil and the netherlands withdrew their ambassadors in protest
two australians are due to face the firing squad
widodo rejected their requests for clemency as well over appeals from the australian prime minister
imagine every day we have fifty people die because of narcotics of drugs
in one year it's eighteen thousand people who die because of narcotics
we are not going to compromise for drug dealers
no compromise
no compromise he says
the decision of death penalty is on the court
but they can ask for amnesty to the president
but i tell you there will be no amnesty for drug dealers
so no relief amanpour asked for the australians due to die 
no the president shook his head
eighteen thousand people die every year
i ask you is it not more dangerous 


in a deathbed statement litvinenko blamed russian president vladimir putin for ordering his poisoning by tea at a london hotel
the kremlin has always strongly denied the accusation
sir robert owen who's chairman of the inquiry said tuesday that sensitive material relating to possible russian state involvement in litvinenko's death would be heard behind closed doors
the british government initially rejected requests to hold a public inquiry but the decision was reversed last summer after litvinenko's widow marina litvinenko challenged it in court
she argued that a public inquiry would enable the fullest possible investigation
an inquest a coroner led investigation that is held as a matter of course in the case of unnatural deaths in england had been opened after her husband's death
but unlike a public inquiry it can not hear evidence behind closed doors
in alexander litvinenko's case such evidence could involve matters of national security
the issues to which his death gives rise are of the utmost gravity and have attracted worldwide interest and concern owen said
litvinenko a former kgb agent and fierce critic of putin came to britain in two thousand after turning whistle blower on the fsb the kgb's successor
he died at a london hospital on november twenty three two thousand and six after being poisoned by the radioactive material polonium two hundred and ten while drinking tea at the millennium hotel in london's grosvenor square
uk prosecutors have asked for the extradition of two men andrei lugovoi and dmitry kovtun from russia in connection with litvinenko's murder
but moscow has refused saying russia's constitution does not allow the extradition of russian citizens
both men deny involvement in litvinenko's death
owen said that lugovoi and kovtun had been invited to give evidence to the inquiry by video link from russia and that he hoped they would do so
the public inquiry will look at possible russian state involvement in litvinenko's death
however it will not address the question as to whether the uk government could or should have taken steps to prevent the murder
litvinenko is said by his widow to have been a british agent with a handler at mi six britain's foreign security service
in two thousand and twelve the counsel to the inquest hugh davies said evidence provided by the uk government showed russian involvement and does establish a prima facie case as to the culpability of the russian state in the death of alexander litvinenko
the inquest has been put on hold while the public inquiry is held
owen the coroner in the inquest said the open hearings in the inquiry should conclude before easter
that is early april
more than seventy witnesses are due to be called over the coming weeks including family and friends of litvinenko those who worked with him before his death medical staff who treated him after he fell ill and the pathologists who conducted his autopsy the court heard
the pathologists will testify wednesday on the postmortem results
the presence of radiation in litvinenko's body complicated the autopsy the inquiry heard
a nuclear scientist will also give evidence wednesday about polonium two hundred and ten its qualities where it can be found and what effect it has on the body once ingested
in the course of the inquiry evidence may also deal with the contamination risk posed to the wider public by the transfer of such highly radioactive material
owen said polonium could have been used to kill large numbers of people or spread general panic and hysteria among the public


u.s. president barack obama became the first american chief guest at the parade
not only did he have to endure two hours of a cold delhi morning drizzle albeit in a glass box he also may have noticed how much of india's military hardware was of russian and not american vintage
but most indians will focus on the fact that obama is the first sitting american president to visit india twice
they will remember the many images of obama and prime minister narendra modi shaking hands and exchanging a warm embrace on the airport tarmac and at their first joint press conference in the world's glare
the indian media has dubbed it a bromance evidence of the chemistry that aides on both sides have been at pains to point out for months
it seems like an eternity since the former leader of the indian state of gujarat was persona non grata in the u.s
and so the biggest takeaway from obama's three days in india was the symbolism of the leaders of the world's two biggest democracies cozying up
but others would have seen greater geopolitical implications
as obama watched the republic day parade beijing welcomed pakistan's army chief general raheel sharif for talks
unlike obama's previous india visit in two thousand and ten pakistan was not a focus at least in public statements
instead india seems to be positioning itself for a more global role playing a part in issues that go beyond its borders
there were some other tangible takeaways from the summit too though the exact details were a little fuzzy
modi announced progress had been made on negotiations over a civil nuclear deal a new ten year defense cooperation agreement between the two countries was announced which may have far reaching consequences for both sides on sharing intelligence and military education and there was much talk about boosting bilateral trade from its current level of around one hundred billion dollar a year to five hundred billion dollar by two thousand and twenty five
as with most summits between world leaders what goes on behind the scenes before and after is probably more important at least in terms of detail
but let's give symbolism its moment and its due
for millions of indians who watched the events of the last three days and given the intense media coverage in india it would have been impossible to miss they will now slowly reassess their sense of india's place in the world
maybe that will help broaden india's historically insular foreign policy thinking
maybe it will make india a more prominent player in global issues over time
and maybe just maybe india and the u.s. may move a little closer to forming the defining partnership that obama first promised in two thousand and ten

nasa has released awe inspiring images of the skies above to celebrate the international year of light

while miss colombia twenty two year old student paulina vega took home the crown in miami on sunday night social media was more concerned with the fate of miss jamaica

viewers immediately weighed in with why they felt miss jamaica had been robbed of the title citing everything from her race to her short haircut amongst the flowing manes of other contestants

sajida al rishawi was sentenced to death for that attempt and jordan executed her early wednesday
isis had demanded her release threatening to kill two hostages if jordan didn't comply
isis carried out those killings and jordan carried out al rishawi's execution
but just who was she 
and what's her connection to the new radical sunni group that controls big swaths of syria and iraq 
al rishawi was referred to as an imprisoned sister of the terrorist group in a message purportedly posted online by a known isis supporter
the message proposed a swap of al rishawi for japanese hostage kenji goto
in the video goto was seen holding a photo of what appeared to be beheaded compatriot haruna yukawa
the online posts which cnn could not verify independently appeared four days after an isis video demanded that the japanese government pay two hundred million dollar within seventy two hours for the hostages release
in the latest recording the voice of a person claiming to be goto was heard in english blaming japanese prime minister shinzo abe for yukawa's death
forgoing the money the voice then issued a new isis demand
the release of al rishawi
they are just demanding the release of their imprisoned sister sajida al rishawi the voice said
al rishawi who was being held by authorities in jordan was not seen publicly in nine years
in a televised confession in november two thousand and five al rishawi calmly recounted how she tried to take part in a string of terror attacks at jordanian hotels that month that killed at least fifty seven people
my husband detonated his bomb and i tried to detonate mine but failed al rishawi said on jordanian television showing no emotion
people fled running and i left running with them
in two thousand and six al rishawi was sentenced to death but that same year jordan imposed a moratorium on the death penalty
executions resumed last month
wearing a white head scarf and black dress during the confession al rishawi displayed a belt rigged with explosives and crudely held together with tape
jordanian authorities said al rishawi now in her forty s joined her husband hussein ali al shamari to carry out the suicide bombings at the radisson hotel
his explosives went off killing thirty eight people attending a wedding reception in the ballroom
three male bombers and fifty seven bystanders were killed at three hotels in the series of attacks
she said she was an iraqi who lived in ramadi and using fake passports traveled to jordan with her husband
she told jordanian authorities that her husband taught her how to use her explosives belt
in the confession al rishawi said my husband is the one who organized everything
jordanian authorities at the time said the attacks were orchestrated by the terrorist group al qaeda in iraq which was led by jordanian born abu musab al zarqawi
al zarqawi was killed in a u.s. strike in june two thousand and six
a post on a website used by al qaeda in iraq claimed responsibility for the jordan attacks
deputy prime minister marwan muasher said after the attacks that al rishawi was the sister of zarqawi's right hand man who was killed in falluja iraq
he did not identify the lieutenant
isis leader abu bakr al baghdadi was a lieutenant of al zarqawi retired lt. col. james reese a former u.s. delta force commander told cnn
there's a link back to this woman reese said of the alleged prisoner swap
this is just another way to help them bring these people back and help with their propaganda
in february two thousand and fourteen al qaeda renounced ties to isis after months of infighting between isis and another group al nusra front
isis started in two thousand and four as al qaeda in iraq with the aim of creating an islamic state across sunni areas of iraq and in syria
after the jordan attacks muasher told cnn that al rishawi was not wearing an explosives belt when she was apprehended but two belts were found with her
one was filled with the explosive rdx the other with ball bearings a technique used by the other bombers
the aim was to inflict the largest number of casualties he said
muasher said jordanian authorities had information that al rishawi's husband asked her to step out of the room when her explosives failed to detonate
in her confession al rishawi said she and her husband stood at opposite sides of the room for the double bombing
there was a wedding ceremony in the hotel she said
there were women men and children

nine were french military personnel and two were greek pilots a senior spanish defense official told cnn
the jet crashed on takeoff hitting other planes on the ground during a nato training exercise said the source who by custom was not named
twenty people were injured according to a statement from the spanish defense ministry
all those hurt are either french or italian
nato secretary general jens stoltenberg said he was deeply saddened by the crash
this is a tragedy which affects the whole nato family
i express my heartfelt condolences to the loved ones and the nations of those who lost their lives and i wish a speedy recovery to the injured he said in a statement
the plane was taking part in an exercise in the framework of nato's tactical leadership programme which aims to improve multinational cooperation in air operations stoltenberg said

the united states united kingdom france germany italy spain belgium denmark and greece the spanish air force reported on its website last week
it was expected to be a four week program from january nineteen to february thirteen with training to prepare pilots for tactical missions including nighttime missions the site said

the announcement comes a day after an iraqi official declared that iraq's diyala province had been liberated from isis
idriss nassan kobani's deputy foreign minister told cnn he expects an official announcement tuesday if things continue this way
ypg is in control nassan said using the acronym for the people's protection units
they are making sure to clear the streets and the places from isis to declare it a free city
ypg spokesman polat can confirmed the news in a tweet
congratulations for liberation of kobani to all of humanity kurdistan and people of kobani
nassan called for the quick implementation of a humanitarian corridor to help the myriad refugees in the city whom he said need everything
a kobani official who did not want to be named because it would interfere with tuesday's official announcement said the kurds were going house to house in the newly liberated area to check for booby traps
once the traps are removed or defused the fighters will invite residents to return to their homes the official said
according to london based opposition group the syrian observatory for human rights which also confirmed kobani was liberated since october six when isis first raised its banner on the city's outskirts the fighting among isis ypg and the rebel battalions backing ypg has killed nine hundred and seventy nine isis combatants three hundred and twenty four ypg fighters and twelve rebels
thirty eight more isis militants died in attacks using booby trapped vehicles or explosive belts and the isis shelling of kobani killed twelve civilians sohr said
on the other hand hundreds of militants died during u.s. and arab allies airstrikes on the city and its countryside
meanwhile large parts of the city have become uninhabitable due to u.s. and arab allies air raids detonation of booby trapped vehicles and mutual shelling the group said
kobani apparently declared itself autonomous exactly one year before monday's victory sohr said
a large scale military operation to reclaim iraq's diyala province from isis was successful iraqi transportation minister hadi al amiri said sunday
the operation started last week and at least fifty eight people including two journalists were killed
nearly three hundred others were wounded
in a televised news conference sunday al ameri who is also the head of the a powerful shiite militia said the province was liberated from isis
al amiri said that iraqi security forces are searching for isis militants who fled into orchards and farms in remote areas
diyala police commander brig
gen. jamil kamel al shamari also announced that diyala is now under full control of iraqi security forces
isis has been fighting for kobani for months hoping to add it to the territory it already controls in syria and iraq as part of what it calls its independent islamic nation
syria has been embroiled in a more than three year civil war with government troops battling isis and other rebels elsewhere leaving kobani's ethnic kurds to defend the city
kobani aka ayn al arab is strategically important because of its location on the border with turkey
airstrikes by the united states and its allies part of a larger u.s. led coalition effort against isis in the region intermittently take out isis targets in the area
the coalition started operations in september

but for many on the streets of athens it's his words that matter his promise of no more bailouts no more submission no more blackmailing
it's a message of hope that resonates with those across this country hardened by years of the eu's bitter medicine
austerity
read
greeks vote in election that could lead to showdown over bailout
greece was among the nations hardest hit by the global financial crisis
a deeply troubled economy widespread unemployment and civil unrest meant that back in two thousand and ten the country was teetering on the brink of exit from the euro labeled the sick man of europe
but the prescription handed down by the troika the international monetary fund european commission and european central bank was always going to be difficult to swallow
tax hikes a freeze on state pensions bans on early retirement and deep cuts in government salaries in return for a two hundred and forty billion bailout
five years on and the greek economy is starting to recover
last year it came out of recession
this year the country's gdp is expected to grow zero point seven percents
but some fear the years spent locked in a straitjacket of debt and stagnation may have done more harm than good
there is widespread unemployment with twenty seven percents of the population out of work industrial production has shrunk thirty percents and three million people live on or below the poverty line
for many here austerity has only led to hardship and caused unbearable strains that are visible on faces across the city
over instant coffee at his house on the outskirts of athens nikos fifty eight says his world has been turned upside down since losing his job in two thousand and nine
he has been unemployed ever since
i used to have money in my pocket and now i have nothing he explains
i was supposed to get my pension next year and now that has been pushed back by two years
just put yourself in my position
the initial frustration he felt has turned to anger
his pride has also been battered
to get by he has had to ask his mother to share her pension not easy for a man who had always been the breadwinner
now he and his four grown up sons depend on his wife valentina
but her wages which have been slashed by fifty five percents are not enough to feed everyone leaving her with a tough decision
help the family or pay taxes
who to help first 
they are four
i don't buy anything for myself so that i can help them
i had to pay two hundred and sixty in taxes and i only earn eight hundred
so i haven't paid the taxes and gave the money to my son to help him with his rent she explains
the family's desperation has only been exacerbated by their disenchantment with politicians and their policies
since two thousand and five greece has had six prime ministers each one vowing to bring an end to the crisis
each one promising jobs and growth
but nothing nikos says has changed
so he and his wife are gambling on greece's left wing syriza party their pledge to bring an end to austerity and their message that hope is coming
angry and frustrated nikos insists
things can't get any worse with a new government
and if they do we'll vote again for someone else
have politicians ever asked an unemployed citizen when he wakes up in the morning and who has a family if this person has a single euro or five in his pocket to buy a carton of milk to feed his children 
he asks
i don't trust any of them
for now nikos and valentina are placing their trust in syriza and its leader alexis tsipras who has promised to raise the minimum wage re hire public sector workers reduce taxes and tackle the country's silent humanitarian crisis
but tsipras's boldest pledge and the one that is making the rest of europe nervous is his promise to renegotiate the terms of the greek bailout deal
at syriza's last rally before sunday's general election i asked the party's finance spokesman george stathakis what they will do if they can't see eye to eye with europe
what we are arguing for with our european partners is a new arrangement that will remove part of the public debt burden on the greek economy and at the same time allow greece to get back to work he says
in other words they want to stay in the single currency but with more fiscal leeway a breathing space of sorts so the country can recover from its economic coma and begin to grow again
both working class and middle class voters and both public and private sector workers have voiced support for this call
computer developer stathis papachristou says he has always voted for the conservatives but having seen his wages slashed and his taxes increase and as the father of a newborn baby he's voting for change this time around
syriza doesn't express one hundred percents my opinions and i'm not level with what they believe and what they want to do but i believe its something new a new party with fresh ideas that is going to change what is already rotten he explains
there is no doubt that anger and austerity have fueled the rise of syriza in a country whose citizens are calling for social and economic change
but if he is elected the question of whether tsipras can make a difference to greece will depend on what he does with his power and how the eu and its leaders deal with him
whatever the outcome of sunday's polls the hard work it seems is just beginning

what does this victory mean for greece and for the debt ridden countries of southern europe 
for greece this is a decisive step in the demise of pasok and new democracy the parties that have been in power for forty years
secondly it shows the failure of the political strategy pursued by the troika to implement austerity in southern europe by relying on centrist parties to form a cartel that is insulated from voters
austerity is of course the main culprit for the death of traditional politics in greece
this is mainly because it has undermined the system of mass party patronage on which the two traditional big parties on the center left and center right have relied on to alternate in power

what's next for greece 
for four decades politicians from both parties built their electoral success on the distribution of political spoils in exchange for votes
public sector jobs infrastructure projects protection from competitors through licensing and closed shops and social benefits targeted at particular occupations among other perks and benefits benefiting party supporters
pork barrel politics as it is known has long been the cornerstone of greek politics and also one of the causes of the deep economic problems it is facing now
this immensely costly system was able to survive at the cost of high inflation and currency devaluations or mounting public debt
but when the interest rates on government bonds shot up and debt could no longer be used to finance the spoils system greece was taken to the brink of bankruptcy
when the troika imposed a drastic program of austerity and liberalization pasok and new democracy were deprived of the very tools they had relied on for so long to stay in power
turning off the tap of public spending was like slitting their own wrists
voters and their traditional clienteles abandoned them because they had no real ideological program other than running the state
this problem was particularly brutal for pasok which collapsed from nearly forty percents support before the crisis to four percents today
this opened up room for new challengers on the left promising a rupture with the old elites but also on the far right
the victory of syriza also signals the broader failure of the political strategy that has been employed to implement austerity in the debt ridden countries of southern europe a strategy best described as cartel politics
cartel politics involves the formation of political alliances between the ruling centrist parties to implement austerity
just as competing firms sometimes agree to fix prices or production levels competing political parties agree to put their ideological differences aside to cling to power together in spite of the huge unpopularity of the policies they put in place
this is essentially what happened in greece with the pasok new democracy government but also in italy with the technocratic cabinet of mario monti or the grand coalition of enrico letta which united the center left democratic party and silvio berlusconi's right wing pdl
in portugal another country in dire economic conditions the socialist minority government of jos socrates also benefited from the informal support of its main center right counterpart to carry out austerity measures and avoid a bailout
in spain the nascent rise of the left wing podemos party can also be explained by the lack of differentiation of center left and center right policies before and after the crisis even if it never materialized in a de facto coalition
forming political cartels is understandable in a context where any party in office is bound to have to pass unpopular policies imposed by creditors that will cost votes and alienate a sizable share of the electorate
it is a good way to stay in office in the short term but it is a terrible way to keep votes in the medium and long term because no choice is presented to citizens
whoever they vote for the policies will be the same and they will be painful
abstention and apathy grows and voters become attracted to challengers promising an alternative
as the electoral base of centrist parties shrinks the only way for them to remain in power is to band together to compensate for the loss of voters until this electoral base becomes too small to stay in government
syriza is the first challenger to break the greek political cartel
greece may be a special case because of the extent of its economic collapse but other movements elsewhere are also looming on the horizon
in spain podemos has been leading the polls in spite of the fact that it was created less than a year ago
in italy beppe grillo's five star movement has made a breakthrough in the last european elections
others will surge if politicians continue to believe that democracy can be put on hold to satisfy markets

gamal and alaa mubarak had served the maximum pretrial detention allowed
a previous embezzlement conviction of the two sons and their father was overturned this year but they all face a retrial on the embezzlement charges
the mubaraks and four new defendants are accused of embezzling seventeen point nine million dollar allocated for the renovation of presidential palaces
mubarak was sentenced last year to three years in prison
his sons to four years each
they have maintained their innocence
the mubaraks appealed saying their sentences were too harsh
mubarak ruled egypt as president for twenty nine years before he was ousted during the arab spring protests
in another case he was convicted in two thousand and twelve of issuing orders to kill peaceful protesters during the country's two thousand and eleven uprising and was sentenced to life in prison
he appealed and was granted a new trial last year
in november he was cleared of those charges and of corruption

that's the big question on the mind of indonesia's transportation minister as investigators finish preparing the initial report into the crash last month of the airbus a three hundred and twenty two hundred with one hundred and sixty two passengers on board
the question is why this plane suddenly climbed from thirty two thousand feet to almost thirty eight thousand feet without any information and any warning ignasius jonan told cnn in an interview monday
jonan said none of the other planes in the area experienced the turbulent weather patterns that led the pilot of qz eight thousand five hundred and one to request a change of course and an increase in altitude shortly before it disappeared off radar
data provided by the indonesian transportation ministry shows that less than three minutes after making that request flight qz eight thousand five hundred and one began climbing sharply rising nearly six thousand feet in less than a minute
the plane then fell rapidly and disappeared off radar in the middle of the java sea
that sequence of events is based on radar and transponder information not on the contents of the plane's flight data recorder
the analysis of the information from the data recorder and the other so called black box the cockpit voice recorder is expected to be part of the preliminary report that indonesia is due to submit to international air safety regulators by january twenty eight
the transportation minister told cnn that he wants to ensure the victims families and the public are kept informed and that there's nothing hidden from them
but when asked if that meant he would release the preliminary report to the public he said no
jonan said he will urge investigators to release the final report as soon as possible
it won't be a year that's my promise he said
jonan oversaw an investigation into why flight qz eight thousand five hundred and one was able to take off on a sunday even though airasia lacked permission to fly from surabaya to singapore on that day of the week
his inquiry discovered sixty other flights had been running without proper approvals
those flights have been banned he says and ministry officials are now regularly checking the schedules
while he calls the issue of flights operating without permission a big worry he says he believes it was unrelated to the crash of flight qz eight thousand five hundred and one
he also says he thinks that this crash should not be seen as a permanent black mark against indonesia's safety record
we run around one thousand flights a day and seven thousand flights a week jonan said
and that's a lot of flights in the air of indonesia
so one crashed unfortunately
so i would suggest it's not a big issue that can make everybody not fly in the air of indonesia

the leader of the left wing syriza party alexis tsipras was sworn in as greece's new prime minister on monday after forming a coalition with the right wing independent greeks party
tsipras has vowed to end austerity measures and renegotiate the terms of greece's european union bailout
since two thousand and ten greece has received bailouts totaling two hundred and forty billion euros
in return the international monetary fund european commission and european central bank demanded tax hikes a freeze on state pensions bans on early retirement and deep cuts in government salaries
syriza's pledges to try to get some of greece's colossal debt written off and roll back unpopular austerity measures appealed to exasperated members of the electorate even if they potentially jeopardize greece's place in the eurozone
the party's victory could lead to a dramatic showdown with the debt laden nation's lenders
syriza's message is one that has also resonated in other southern european countries under the restrictions of international bailouts
its victory could boost other populist parties such as beppe grillo's anti euro five star movement in italy and the podemos movement in spain
declaring victory for syriza on sunday after polls showed it winning at least one hundred and forty nine seats in the three hundred seat parliament tsipras forty appeared to brace for a bigger battle
we are regaining our lost dignity

now that we are heard by all of europe we will fight with the same passion the same confidence he told cheering supporters
so let's go and let's all continue this beautiful and tough fight he said
greece leaves behind the austerity that ruined it leaves behind the fear leaves behind five years of humiliation and greece moves forward with optimism and hope and dignity he told the crowd
european central bank executive board member benot cur told cnn on monday that greece would still have to pay its debt
they have to pay
those are the european rules of the game
there is no room for unilateral action in europe that doesn't exclude a discussion for example on the rescheduling of this debt
but i would like to underline that it's not the ecb's money it's the governments money
it's a discussion between mr. tsipras and the european governments
chief eu commission spokesman margaritis schinas said it respected the sovereign choice of the greek people
we are ready to engage with the new government once it is formed
greece has made remarkable progress in recent years and we stand ready to continue to assist greece in addressing the remaining reform challenges he said
the austerity imposed by greece's international creditors has cut deep
unemployment has soared to twenty eight percents and many people who still have jobs have seen drastic decreases in wages pensions frozen and the retirement age pushed back
the governing new democracy party had pointed to recent improvements in economic indicators as signs that things were getting better
after conceding defeat sunday outgoing prime minister antonis samaras said his conscience was clear
i got a country on the verge of ruin
i was asked to try and save it and i did it he said
most people did not believe we could stand strong but we did
now he said greece is secure and slowly walking away from the crisis
and more than anything he said i give back a country that is a member of the european parliament and the euro
on monday the ceo of one of greece's largest banks piraeus said syriza was coming to power at a fortunate time
the tide is changing in europe the macro is improving in greece the european central bank is launching an unprecedented easing and that will have a significant bearing on the fortunes of greece going forward anthimos thomopoulos said
greece has already gone through massive adjustment much of the hard work has already been completed the green shoots of recovery are already there so this is a great opportunity for greece a great opportunity for a new government
in his victory speech sunday tsipras noted that greece's election could have an impact far beyond his country's borders
our victory is at the same time it's a victory for all the people of europe that are fighting against austerity that's ruining the common european future he said
but it's unclear how syriza's plans to renegotiate the bailout would play out
is alexis tsipras man of the moment 

nudity is the most simple and primal gesture it packs a punch owens said of his decision to have his models bare all
it's powerful

who else can really get away with this stuff 
it's a corporate world
the looks were simply for shock and awe and the attention such reactions generate after all they can't be worn out in public and won't be sold in stores
but let's be honest
were we even shocked 
after all female models have been asked to sashay down runways in states of near nakedness for years
meanwhile more and more films are featuring full frontal male nudity
there was michael fassbender in shame of course
and who can forget the uproar over the cameo of ben affleck's penis in gone girl albeit so brief one had to know the precise moment to look for it 
and if we've seen ben affleck's penis who cares about some male model's 
of course women have been going full frontal in films for years
perhaps the onslaught of nakedness is a sign that public nudity is becoming an equal opportunity endeavor
that women are no longer required to do all the showing
that's not a bad thing
maybe the free the nipple people are finally getting their way and women will be able to parade topless around town or at the gym or wherever they please without stares or stigma as men have done for ages
more likely it's a clear sign that we're a culture so overexposed that we've got no other choice but to up the stakes at every turn
we are becoming have become immune to that which was previously surprising revolting awe inspiring
it's amazing how quickly lady gaga went from outre to passe isn't it 
meanwhile madonna is a faint middle aged voice from the past who in a time long ago made news with pointy bras positively puritanical compared to the starlets of today
consider their norms
going commando that's without underwear because yes there's even a phrase for it
giving birth on tv
posing naked for mainstream magazines
the kardashian sisters spent the fall one upping each other first kim's naked backside on the cover of paper and then kourtney's naked pregnant belly online at dujour because if one reality sister does it so too must the other
miley cyrus meanwhile continues to one up herself graduating from foam fingers and lewd gestures to her recent full frontal magazine spread in v magazine the release of which she celebrated with a crude shoutout on social media
but what's next 
what does she or any of these women do for an encore 
where does a jaded culture go from here for kicks 
the envelope has already been pushed beyond what we once thought were the limits
what is left 
perhaps they'll think of something
you just know those most shocking shows are trying to figure out how to show somebody actually die
you know that some starlet on the verge will go beyond a private sex tape to arrange to be caught in the act
or maybe we'll grow up and become more european in our sensibilities and react less like middle school boys at the sight of a breast
maybe we'll learn that hitting bottom culturally reveals a whole new bottom underneath
whatever the impetus the bottom is in sight
after all being outrageous today is hard work and only getting harder
the payoff meanwhile has nowhere to go but down






the thirty year old woman surnamed huang allegedly colluded with an obstetrician yang in xinxiang county henan province to sell the baby boy according to details published in the procuratorial daily a legal publication
yang sold the baby boy to a couple in the same county for forty two thousand yuan
she gave thirty five thousand yuan to huang and kept seven thousand yuan for herself the report said
the case came to light in august after the boy's grandmother alerted police
the grandmother said huang had left the village to go to her parents home after quarreling with her husband
when huang returned two weeks later she said the baby had died but the grandmother grew suspicious as her daughter in law didn't seem sad
a relative then discovered that the boy had been sold
huang had a son from a previous marriage and thought a new baby would be bad for the elder child reports said
the boy is now in the care of his father's family
child trafficking is a long standing problem in china
a traditional preference for sons and the country's one child policy means that boys are particularly prized
earlier this month a chinese man who was abducted from a vegetable market as a toddler enjoyed an emotional reunion with his father after twenty four years apart
the news came the same week police said they had busted a trafficking ring involving at least one hundred and three people and rescued thirty seven newborn babies that were transported in handbags and suitcases to prospective buyers
according to the u.s. state department's two thousand and fourteen trafficking in persons report china does not fully comply with the recommended minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking
however the report says it is making significant efforts to do

given her well known love of horses it's perhaps fitting some might say unimaginative that the majority of gifts presented to queen elizabeth ii from world leaders last year revolved her favorite four legged animals
dog lovers look away now her majesty's iconic pet corgis didn't even get a look in
included in the two thousand and fourteen list of gifts was a mounted sculpture of a white horse from france's president francois hollande
a bronze sculpture of a horse's head from the emir of qatar
and another bronze statuette of the famous irish thoroughbred arkle from the president of ireland michael higgins along with a book of the same name
a dressage crop from the governor general of canada david johnston and a boot scraper from felsted school in the east of england can also be put to good use at her majesty's stud farm on the royal sandringham estate
among the more peculiar gifts given to the queen was a miniature seven inch throne from the game of thrones tv series during a visit to northern ireland in june
however it's far from the most outlandish present bestowed upon the monarch
during her sixty two year long reign the queen has received a jaguar from brazil two giant turtles from the seychelles an elephant from cameroon and several horses most notably a beloved black mare called burmese from the royal canadian mounted police
indeed the queen rode burmese at the traditional trooping the color parade for eighteen consecutive years and in two thousand and five unveiled a bronze statue of herself atop the horse outside the saskatchewan legislative building in canada
but what happens to the many gifts her majesty receives throughout the year that aren't to her taste 
live animals are donated to london zoo perishable items such as food and flowers are given to local hospices and all other presents which don't go on display in the royal residencies are stored at the royal archive at windsor castle a clarence house spokesperson told cnn
some items are even loaned to galleries such as a maori canoe given by the new zealand government which is now on display at the british museum
when it comes to royal presents the queen's great grandson prince george recorded the largest haul in two thousand and fourteen
during a tour of australia and new zealand with his parents the duke and duchess of cambridge the toddler received a surfboard skateboard possum skin cloak and more soft toys than other children would get in a lifetime of christmases
fittingly the previous year prince george also received a teddy wearing the same silk jacket as those worn by the queen's jockeys from promotional group great british racing
will the young prince also inherit a love of horse racing passed down through the centuries 
indeed legend has it queen victoria became so excited while watching a race at ascot one time that she broke the window of the royal box in a rush to see the finish
queen elizabeth ii was more contained than her great great grandmother though still visibly delighted when her own horse estimate won britain's prestigious gold cup race in two thousand and thirteen
so what would one buy for the horse racing mad monarch that hasn't been bought before 
the ultimate gift would be a nomination to galileo or frankel the two most expensive stallions in the world said nick attenborough from great british racing of the chance to mate a mare with some of the most prized stallions on the planet
a mare mating with frankel including a live foal guarantee would cost someone one hundred and twenty five thousand
at that price it's a gift fit for a queen

the three adults distracted sales staff by pretending to browse for items in a branch of emperor watch and jewelry a chain store popular with chinese tourists on friday afternoon while a girl estimated to be aged between twelve and fourteen years pocketed a one hundred and seventeen carat diamond necklace from a store front display cabinet police told cnn
while exact details of how the girl shoplifted the necklace are still under investigation local media reports said the girl stole a key from a drawer to open the display cabinet while the adult accomplices kept staff busy
the three adults posed as big spenders and demanded employees show them jewelry in an apparent move to divert staff attention an anonymous police source told the south china morning post
according to security footage stills a girl appears walking calmly out of the mall with her hands stuffed in the pockets of her grey hooded sweatshirt
since the robbery extra security guards have been deployed outside the store
a spokesperson from the jewelry store told cnn business continued as usual
our first and foremost priority is to comply with the police investigation but we still have to wait for the results to see what measures can be taken to strengthen the security level he said

the militants appear to have killed one of the two japanese hostages they have been holding
and they're apparently demanding the release of a convicted terrorist in jordan to spare the life of the other
here's where things stand at the moment
a video file posted online saturday by a known isis supporter shows an image of one hostage kenji goto holding a photo of what appears to be the corpse of his fellow captive haruna yukawa
the voice of a person claiming to be goto speaks over the image saying in english that japanese prime minister shinzo abe is to blame for yukawa's death
you were given a deadline he says referring to isis earlier demand that japan pay two hundred million dollar by friday to save the lives of the two hostages
the voice then announces a new ultimatum
the release of sajida al rishawi an iraqi woman facing the death penalty in jordan for her role in a series of bombings in two thousand and five that killed dozens of people at hotels in the arab kingdom
abe said sunday that experts were analyzing the video but that it seemed highly credible
u.s. authorities said they had no reason to doubt its authenticity
an isis affiliated online radio station al bayan reported that the recording was released by the extremist group
it also reported the killing of yukawa and the prisoner swap demand for goto in its newscast sunday
it didn't identify goto by name
but goto's stepfather yukio ishido raised doubts about whether it was his stepson's voice in the video
i get the sense it's not his voice he told reporters
i've heard his english a couple times
i felt it was a bit different
abe condemned the apparent killing of yukawa and called for goto to be released immediately
such act of terrorism is outrageous and impermissible which causes me nothing but strong indignation he said
but the japanese prime minister declined to comment on how his government would respond to the new demand which doesn't appear to have a clear deadline
after isis released the first video of the hostages tuesday japan set up a crisis center in jordan and said it was trying to communicate with the militant group through third parties such as governments in the region and tribal leaders
japanese officials declined to explicitly rule out paying a ransom but said they wouldn't yield to terrorism
they stressed that an aid package abe had pledged to countries affected by isis cited by the militant group as the reason for the huge ransom demand was only for humanitarian purposes
i would be surprised if the jordanian government or japan really pushed forward and released this female suicide bomber as isis has requested said cnn global affairs analyst david rohde referring to al rishawi whose explosives failed to go off in the hotel attack in which she participated
cnn law enforcement analyst tom fuentes called the swap a nonstarter noting that isis is already holding a jordanian pilot whose plane crashed in syria
jordan is part of the u.s. led coalition that's conducting airstrikes against isis targets
if there is any bargain going to be struck between jordan and isis it's going to include their pilot said fuentes a former fbi assistant director
foria younis the chief executive of south asia middle east consultants highlighted the high profile of al rishawi in jordan
this jordanian prisoner is probably the biggest terrorist prisoner that jordan has younis told cnn
to release her it's just going to require i think a lot more than just this one japanese hostage she said
yukawa forty two comes across as a lost soul who went to syria last year in search of purpose after suffering a series of setbacks in his life
over the past decade yukawa had attempted suicide lost his wife to cancer and then lost his home and business
after changing his first name to its feminine form he said he believed he was the reincarnation of a manchu princess who spied on the japanese in world war ii
on a blog yukawa once wrote i look normal outside but inside i'm mentally ill
but his travels to syria appeared to have been an attempt to rebuild his life
he had dreams of setting up private security company
it was there that he met goto forty seven an experienced freelance journalist who frequently reported from war zones
goto has a wife and two young daughters in japan
despite their contrasting backgrounds the two apparently became friends in syria with goto helping show yukawa how to get by in a risky environment
after yukawa was reported to have been captured in august goto is believed to have decided to go into isis controlled territory with finding his friend among his goals
yukawa's father has expressed grief over his son's apparent killing
i have been praying such a thing would not happen but unfortunately it has finally come to pass and my heart aches shoichi yukawa said in an interview with japanese media
i feel so guilty that mr. goto has been detained and threatened death after he had entered there to rescue my son at the risk of his life he added
i wish him to be released and return to japan immediately and continue his activity
goto's mother made a plea to her son's captors to release him on friday saying he wasn't an enemy of isis
words fail to describe how i feel junko ishido said
kenji always has been a kind person ever since he was little
he was always saying i want to save the lives of children in war zones 
u.s. president barack obama spoke with abe by phone sunday from new delhi the white house said
obama offered condolences for the murder of yukawa by isis and conveyed solidarity with the japanese people according to a statement
the u.n. security council said in a statement that it strongly condemns the apparent killing of yukawa describing it as a heinous and cowardly act
it demanded the immediate release of goto
british prime minister david cameron suggested japan was right not to bow to the terrorists demand for ransom saying that britain strongly supports the firm stance prime minister abe and his government have taken
the united states and britain both refuse to pay ransoms to terrorists
but other countries notably france have reportedly spent tens of millions of dollars on the release of hostages held by islamic militants in recent years despite denying it publicly
japan has also paid kidnappers to free its citizens in the past according to the new york times
in one thousand nine hundred and ninety nine tokyo handed over three million dollar for the release of four mining experts held in kyrgyzstan the newspaper reported

hundreds of boko haram gunmen launched a predawn attack sunday on maiduguri the capital of borno state
soldiers repelled the attacks and officials have since eased a curfew imposed as a result said col. sani usman a military spokesman
but a simultaneous attack on nearby monguno town was a different story
the islamist militants captured the town together with its military barracks a nigerian military officer said
it's unclear how many people were wounded or killed during the battle for the two cities
our soldiers initially repelled the terrorists but they mobilized more fighters and came back in full force
they overwhelmed our troops and forced them to retreat the military officer said
he asked not to be named because he's not authorized to speak to the media
monguno is about one hundred and thirty five kilometers from maiduguri
the former has a population of one hundred thousand while maiduguri has about six hundred thousand
both cities are near the chad and cameroon borders which would give the militants an entry point into those countries
monguno and its military post served as a buffer to keep the militants away from maiduguri
its fall leaves maiduguri vulnerable and puts the extremists in a better position to seize the city
boko haram had been confined to the fishing town of baga since its fighters seized it on january three
thousands were feared killed in that attack which lasted days
borno gov
kashim shettima said soldiers will continue their crackdown on the militants
so long as we have the resources we will continue to regard the efforts to reclaim peace our no
one area of commitments he said
i want to reassure the good people of borno state that we will never abdicate from our responsibility as those they entrusted with leadership
the attack came a day after president goodluck jonathan made a campaign stop in maiduguri ahead of the february fourteen presidential election
u.s. secretary of state john kerry was also in the nation sunday to call for peaceful elections
boko haram has terrorized northern nigeria regularly since two thousand and nine attacking police schools churches and civilians and bombing government buildings
the islamist group has said its aim is to impose a stricter form of sharia law across nigeria which is split between a majority muslim north and a mostly christian south

the commandos members of the elite special action force unit of the philippine national police were killed in a firefight that raged for twelve hours in mamasapano town maguindanao province said police deputy director general leonardo espina
eleven police commandos had also been wounded in the firefight he told a press conference in cotabato city monday
members of both the moro islamic liberation front with whom the government has signed a peace agreement and the bangsamoro islamic freedom fighters with whom it has not were involved in the firefight officials and rebel groups said
grisly footage purporting to be of the aftermath of the battle was circulated online showing uniformed bodies strewn in a rice field
this is the single largest loss of life in recent memory secretary of the department of interior and local government mar roxas told the press conference calling for a moment of silence from assembled reporters
these saf operatives are fallen heroes
they were just doing their job
that is why we salute them
roxas said that three hundred and ninety two saf commandos been engaged to hunt malaysian bomb maker and jemaah islamiyah leader zulkifli bin hir known as marwan and filipino bomb maker abdul basit usman
the fbi says that marwan who is suspected of having conducted bomb making training for abu sayyaf and has a five million dollar state department bounty for information leading to his arrest is believed to have been hiding in the country's south since two thousand and three
the u.s. government is also offering a reward of up to one million dollar for information leading to usman's arrest
roxas said the commandos were retreating from the assault on their targets when they came under fire from members of the biff
in maneuvering away from the biff assault they strayed into territory controlled by the milf several kilometers away and a misencounter ensued
the government had not been seeking to sabotage the peace agreement with the milf by carrying out the operation without their knowledge he said
we are hopeful and confident that this will not derail the peace talks he said
this was not directed against milf but this is directed against a very very specific high profile terrorist bomber who was in the area
espina said that it was most highly likely that marwan has been killed in the saf assault and dna testing was being carried out to confirm this
but initial reports suggested that usman had fled
a board of inquiry would conduct an investigation into the operation including looking into the apparent lack of coordination with milf forces in the area said espina
mohagher iqbal chief negotiator for the milf said in an interview with philippine radio station dzrh that a lack of coordination between the milf ceasefire committee and the government was to blame for the outbreak of violence
it was a standard operating procedure that one side should notify the other before they began an operation he said describing the incident as self defense
while the area where the fighting occurred was mostly under milf control he said biff which was also involved in the firefight was a mobile group moving throughout the region
chances are they were just there when it happened he said
he said his group was doing everything it could to ease tensions over the fighting and that the incident would not have an effect on the ongoing peace process
the philippines signed an agreement with the milf the largest rebel group in the south in march last year
the deal offered greater autonomy economic and political power in return for the rebels surrendering their weapons and ending a decades long insurgency
but hardline rebel groups opposed to the peace process such as the biff remain active
lieutenant colonel harold cabunoc public affairs office chief for the armed forces of the philippines appealed to the hardline biff group monday to return any personnel under their control
we are also calling on our brothers in the bangsamoro islamic freedom fighters that if indeed they are still holding some of the pnp personnel they must respect their rights and they must be returned to their mother units and ultimately to their family members he told reporters
miriam coronel ferrer chair of the government panel responsible for overseeing the peace process with muslim insurgents said in a statement monday that the violence highlighted the challenges that confound the peace process
but the outbreak only strengthened the resolve of the peace panel to implement the bangsamoro basic law the bill currently being heard by politicians that seeks to implement the peace deal between the government and the milf
hearings of the bill were suspended monday following the violence
with better cooperation we will be able to prevent these kinds of incidents she said

as the nation choked on its cornflakes many took to social media to express shock and dismay and repeat the question is this a joke 
at an australia day function in canberra abbott was forced to defend his decision and dismissed the reaction on twitter as electronic graffiti
i think that in the media you make a big mistake to pay too much attention to social media
you wouldn't report what's sprayed up on the walls of buildings abbott was quoted as saying in the sydney morning herald
of prince philip abbott said
he's the patron of hundreds of organizations
he's the inspiration and wellspring of the duke of edinburgh's awards which have provided leadership training for tens if not hundreds of thousands of australians over the years
the ninety three year old duke is the only son of prince andrew of greece whose ancestors hail from danish royalty
he married in queen elizabeth ii in one thousand nine hundred and forty seven who is head of the commonwealth and is required to sign off on abbott's decision an irony not lost on australia's comedians
gift for santa 
more like a gift to republicans some said
abbott reintroduced damehoods and knighthoods last year twenty eight years after they were retired under the leadership of bob hawke's labor government
at the time abbott said the honor of becoming a knight and dame of the order of australia would be extended to australians of extraordinary and pre eminent achievement and merit
my intention is that this new award will go to those who have accepted public office rather than sought it and who can never by virtue of that office ever entirely return to private life he said
so far only one dame and three knights have been appointed including air chief marshal sir angus houston who has most recently led operations to recover lost malaysian flights mh three hundred and seventy and mh seventeen
opposition leader bill shorten said australia had entered a timewarp to extend the honor to english royalty
it's not about him but he's a british royal why would we give him our top australian honor 
he's already got a lot of them he said
some wondered how prince philip would react to the announcement
for others it was an opportunity to revive some the duke's famous quotes
some thought it was sure sign phil could take some of australia's other top honors
and then there was the lone voice calling for calm
sort of
at the time of writing buckingham palace had yet to release an official statement
though its twitter account posted a link to learn more about the australian royal family
abbott didn't take to twitter to try to stifle the spray of e graffiti
his contribution to the great wall of outrage was a simple
not likely straya says

she is dressed in a bathing suit smiling radiantly while performing a gymnastic split
edith eva eger says the portrait was taken by her first teenage crush
a jewish boy named imre
he like so many others would not survive the holocaust
i had my seventeen th birthday in auschwitz eger says
seventy years later eger appears frail at first glance until she astounds a new acquaintance by performing a dance kick that goes shoulder high
the eighty seven year old says her fondest childhood memories still revolve around dancing and training to compete for the hungarian olympic team as a gymnast
but then i was told that i had to train somewhere else because i'm jewish and i do not qualify for the olympics eger recalls
my dream was totally shattered
eger was a hungarian jew the youngest of three daughters living in a town called kosice in what is modern day slovakia
her father was a tailor
her mother a civil servant
it wasn't until march one thousand nine hundred and forty four late in world war ii that eger says hungarian nazis came to her house and arrested her family
the jews in hungary were among the last of europe's jewish communities to be targeted by the nazis
the family was taken to other internment centers before they were finally loaded into a train and shipped to the auschwitz concentration camp in poland occupied by nazi germany
my mom held me in the cattle car eger recalls
and she said we don't know where we're going
we don't know what's going to happen
just remember no one can take away from you what you put here in your own mind 
upon arrival at the camp eger said dr. joseph mengele one of the auschwitz complex's top medical officers stood at the end of a line of prisoners deciding who would go to the gas chambers and who would head for the prison barracks
he pointed to my mom to go to the left and i followed my mom eger says
and dr. mengele grabbed me i never forget that eye contact and he said you're going to see you mother soon she's just going to take a shower 
it was the last time eger saw her parents
they died in the gas chambers of auschwitz along with more than a million other jews
but that would not be the ballerina's final encounter with the infamous ss doctor who later became known the angel of death
dr. mengele came to the barracks and wanted to be entertained eger says
fellow inmates volunteered eger to perform for the man who had ordered her parents death
she asked her captors to play the blue danube waltz as she danced for one of the worst war criminals of the holocaust
i was so scared eger says
i closed my eyes and i pretended that the music was tchaikovsky and i was dancing romeo and juliet in the budapest opera house
the german doctor rewarded the jewish girl with an extra ration of bread which she later shared with the girls in her prison quarters
eger says months later those same girls rescued her when she nearly collapsed from disease and starvation during a forced death march through austria
they formed a chair with their arms and they carried me so i wouldn't die she says adding isn't it important that the worst conditions really brought out the best in us 
decades after the horrors of the holocaust dance is still a passion
eger's house on a hill overlooking the pacific ocean is decorated with statues of ballerinas
every sunday she says she goes swing dancing to the music that american soldiers introduced her to when they liberated her in austria in one thousand nine hundred and forty five
i want to have a full life not to be damaged goods she says
perhaps that defiant spirit helped the teenager survive the horrors of world war ii and later blossom as an emigre in the united states
shortly after the war eger met and married a fellow hungarian jew who had been a partisan anti nazi fighter
the young family moved with their infant daughter to the united states to escape communist rule in hungary
she was very shy when i was growing up recalls eger's eldest daughter marianne who says her mother transformed in the one thousand nine hundred and seventy s after a visit to auschwitz
after that she changed dramatically the daughter says
there had always been a bit of sadness behind her eyes and afterwards it was gone
i think it did free her and she became who she is now
it was also in the one thousand nine hundred and seventy s that eger began studying psychology
decades later she still works as a clinical psychologist running a practice out of her home in la jolla
her specialty involved treating patients suffering from post traumatic stress disorder
she evolved at a time as a psychologist when ptsd wasn't even on the map says dr. saul levine professor emeritus in psychiatry at the university of california at san diego who has known and worked with eger for more than twenty years
she is an expert by definition almost by having had that experience herself but also relating to it in a clinical way as well as in a deeply personal way levine said
throughout her career in psychology eger has done extensive consulting work with the u.s. military treating american veterans of wars in vietnam iraq and afghanistan
she has also helped set up shelters for female victims of domestic abuse
auschwitz gave me a tremendous gift in some ways that i can guide people to have resilience and perseverance eger says
in time eger also become a motivational public speaker performing a ted talk and giving speeches at schools and universities
she litters her hungarian accented english with aphorisms aimed at mental healing
self love is self care she tells patients
the biggest concentration camp is in our mind
she blew me away with her extraordinary optimism and energy levine says recalling the first time he saw eger speaking to an audience
she is a force of nature
seventy years after the liberation of auschwitz this holocaust survivor's greatest pride and joy are clearly her three great grandchildren
that's the best revenge to hitler i can think of says the dancer pointing at one of several portraits of her smiling great grandchildren in her office

the previous bids to bring the piece of wreckage estimated to be at least ten meters long out of the water failed after lines being used to lift it broke according to indonesian authorities
on saturday sharp parts of debris sliced through a strap
on sunday a wire rope snapped after the fuselage had reached the surface of the water
the military divers were hoping to avoid similar problems monday by using twice as much rope as the day before said suryadi b. supriyadi director of operations and training for indonesia's search and rescue agency
they were also putting the inflatable bags being used to lift the wreckage inside the fuselage he said
but the deteriorating weather conditions halted the efforts supriyadi said later monday
officials are aiming to float the wreckage to the surface and then hoist it onto a waiting ship
flight qz eight thousand five hundred and one went down on december twenty eight as it flew from the indonesian city of surabaya toward singapore with one hundred and sixty two people on board
indonesian officials have said they believe many of the remains of people still missing from the disaster may be inside the fuselage
supriyadi warned that the walls of the plane body are broken and move around easily making the divers task harder
they had successfully carried out a similar procedure with the tail section of the aircraft earlier this month
as the fuselage neared the surface on sunday one body appeared in the water and was retrieved authorities said
it's the seventy th recovered so far during weeks of searching
efforts by divers before the weekend to examine and get inside the fuselage as it lay on the seafloor were hindered by strong currents and bad visibility
bad weather repeatedly interrupted the work to try to lift the plane over the weekend
investigators are analyzing the contents of flight qz eight thousand five hundred and one's flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder as they try to establish why the airbus a three hundred and twenty two hundred went down in an area of heavy thunderstorms
experts have speculated from the outset that the storms might have played a role in the plane crash
the aircraft lost contact with air traffic control after the pilot asked permission to turn and climb to higher altitude because of bad weather officials have said
indonesia's transportation minister said tuesday that flight qz eight thousand five hundred and one climbed rapidly and then stalled shortly before it crashed

a video file posted online saturday by a known isis supporter shows an image of one hostage kenji goto holding a photo of what appears to be the corpse of his fellow captive haruna yukawa
the voice of a person claiming to be goto speaks over the image saying in english that japanese prime minister shinzo abe is to blame for yukawa's death
you were given a deadline he says referring to isis earlier demand that japan pay two hundred million dollar by friday to save the lives of the two hostages
the voice then announces a new ultimatum
the release of sajida al rishawi an iraqi woman facing the death penalty in jordan for her role in a series of bombings in two thousand and five that killed dozens of people at hotels in the arab kingdom
al bayan radio an isis affiliated online station reported the extremist group's killing of yukawa and the prisoner swap demand for goto in its newscast sunday
it didn't identify goto by name
abe condemned the apparent killing of yukawa and called for goto to be released immediately
such act of terrorism is outrageous and impermissible which causes me nothing but strong indignation he said
experts are analyzing the video which seems highly credible abe said an assessment shared by u.s. authorities who said they had no reason to doubt its authenticity
but goto's stepfather yukio ishido raised doubts about whether it was his stepson's voice in the video
i get the sense it's not his voice he told reporters
i've heard his english a couple times
i felt it was a bit different
abe declined to comment on how his government would respond to the new demand which doesn't appear to have a clear deadline
i would be surprised if the jordanian government or japan really pushed forward and released this female suicide bomber as isis has requested said cnn global affairs analyst david rohde referring to al rishawi whose explosives failed to go off in the hotel attack in which she participated
after isis released the first video of the hostages tuesday japan set up a crisis center in jordan and said it was trying to communicate with the militant group through third parties such as governments in the region and tribal leaders
japanese officials declined to explicitly rule out paying a ransom but said they wouldn't yield to terrorism
they stressed that an aid package abe had pledged to countries affected by isis cited by the militant group as the reason for the huge ransom demand was only for humanitarian purposes
but the japanese efforts appear to have failed to save yukawa forty two whose father was struggling to come to terms with the news
i still don't want to believe it shoichi yukawa told japanese broadcaster nhk his face not shown in the report
if i can see him again i'd like to hold him in my arms
goto's mother junko ishido had made an emotional plea friday for the release of her son saying he isn't an enemy of isis
kenji always has been a kind person ever since he was little she said
he was always saying i want to save the lives of children in war zones 
goto forty seven is an experienced freelance journalist who frequently reported from war zones
he met yukawa who had dreams of setting up a private security firm while they were both in syria last year according to friends
after yukawa was reported to have been captured in august goto apparently decided to leave his wife and two young daughters in japan to go into isis territory to try to extricate him
i asked my son's wife why he had made this decision and the response was that my son felt he had to do everything in his power to help and rescue his friend ishido said
but rather than save yukawa goto ended up becoming another captive in the hands of a brutal militant group that has slaughtered countless iraqis and syrians as well as three americans and two britons
u.s. president barack obama spoke with abe by phone sunday from new delhi the white house said
obama offered condolences for the murder of yukawa by isis and conveyed solidarity with the japanese people according to a statement
obama had condemned the killing in an earlier statement saturday saying the united states will work with its ally to bring the perpetrators of these murders to justice and will continue to take decisive action to degrade and ultimately defeat isis
british prime minister david cameron said the apparent beheading of yukawa and isis threats are yet another reminder of the murderous barbarity of these terrorists
he suggested japan was right not to bow to the terrorists demand for ransom saying that britain strongly supports the firm stance prime minister abe and his government have taken
the united states and britain both refuse to pay ransoms to terrorists
but other countries notably france have reportedly spent tens of millions of dollars on the release of hostages held by islamic militants in recent years despite denying it publicly
japan has also paid kidnappers to free its citizens in the past according to the new york times
in one thousand nine hundred and ninety nine tokyo handed over three million dollar for the release of four mining experts held in kyrgyzstan the newspaper reported

now that his party has apparently won the support of his country's voters alexis tsipras has another fight in front of him
making good on his campaign promise to renegotiate the terms of greece's bailout
we are regaining our lost dignity
now that we are heard by all of europe we will fight with the same passion the same confidence tsipras told cheering supporters
so let's go and let's all continue this beautiful and tough fight
with more than seventy percents of votes counted syriza was officially projected to win at least one hundred and forty nine seats in the three hundred seat parliament
exit polls also placed the party in the lead
but analysts cautioned that it was still too close to call whether syriza would win a majority of seats a key step that would allow the party to govern without forming a coalition government
tsipras forty who could become greece's next prime minister also vowed to end austerity measures
greece leaves behind the austerity that ruined it leaves behind the fear leaves behind five years of humiliation and greece moves forward with optimism and hope and dignity he told the crowd
syriza's pledges to try to get some of greece's colossal debt written off and roll back unpopular austerity measures appealed to exasperated members of the electorate even if they potentially jeopardize greece's place in the eurozone
the election could lead to a dramatic showdown with the debt laden nation's lenders
that is a gamble that people in greece seem to be prepared to take at this point simply because the terms of its bailout have been so severe greek journalist elinda labropoulou told cnn on sunday
one of those people willing to take the risk is eleni antoniou a former public sector employee
people went bankrupt since we entered the bailout poverty is visible across society and i believe that hope is coming with syriza's program not only for greece but for all of europe she said ahead of the election
the austerity imposed by greece's international creditors has cut deep
unemployment has soared to twenty eight percents and many people who still have jobs have seen drastic decreases in wages pensions frozen and the retirement age pushed back
the governing new democracy party had pointed to recent improvements in economic indicators as signs things were getting better
after conceding defeat sunday outgoing prime minister antonis samaras said his conscience was clear
i got a country on the verge of ruin
i was asked to try and save it and i did it he said
most people did not believe we could stand strong but we did
now he said greece is secure and slowly walking away from the crisis
and more than anything he said i give back a country that is a member of the european parliament and the euro
in his victory speech sunday tsipras noted that greece's election could have an impact far beyond his country's borders
our victory is at the same time it's a victory for all the people of europe that are fighting against austerity that's ruining the common european future he said
his message is one that has resonated in other southern european countries under the restrictions of international bailouts
syriza's victory could boost other populist parties like beppe grillo's anti euro five star movement in italy and the podemos movement in spain
but it's unclear how its plans to renegotiate the bailout would play out
is alexis tsipras man of the moment 

the militants launched a simultaneous attack on the town of monguno and were apparently successful in taking control of the town and its military barracks a nigerian military officer in maiduguri told cnn
our soldiers initially repelled the terrorists but they mobilized more fighters and came back in full force
they overwhelmed our troops and forced them to retreat said the officer who asked not to be named because he was not authorized to speak to the media
monguno a town of about one hundred thousand people in northeast nigeria is about a one hundred and thirty five kilometer drive from maiduguri a city of more than six hundred thousand
both cities are tucked into the corner of the country near the borders with chad and cameroon
babagana musa a monguno resident who fled to maiduguri said several trucks carrying soldiers drove into maiduguri
we learned the town has been taken over by boko haram
monguno with its huge military barracks has a strategic importance in that it acts as a buffer to keep boko haram from advancing towards maiduguri
its fall means boko haram is in good position to advance on maiduguri which has been its goal for months
boko haram had been confined to the fishing town of baga since its fighters seized it january three hesitant to move south towards maiduguri because of the military presence in monguno
the islamists attacked the nearby village of jintilo around five a.m. and were engaged in a gunbattle with troops stationed there
the village is about five kilometers from the center of maiduguri the capital of borno state
speaking to reporters sunday afternoon borno governor kashim shettima said so long as we have the resources we will continue to regard the efforts to reclaim peace our no
one area of commitments
i want to reassure the good people of borno state that we will never abdicate from our responsibility as those they entrusted with leadership
he further said he had canceled all engagements outside of borno and intends to remain behind with our people through thick and thin and after meeting with other past and present leaders in northern nigeria pressures are being combined and channeled to the right authorities to ensure that the insurgency problems are brought to an end as quickly as possible
shettima closed by asking the people of borno to remain optimistic and vigilant and urged residents to keep close watch over their children and report any strange person and movement to authorities
the islamists attacked the nearby village of jintilo around five a.m. and were engaged in a gunbattle with troops stationed there
the village is about five kilometers from the center of maiduguri the capital of borno state
the fighting in jintilo forced residents to evacuate their homes and flee into the city while military authorities imposed a round the clock curfew to prevent infiltration by the militants
all the residents of neighborhoods near jintilo have fled into the city due to the ongoing battle between troops and boko haram gunmen who want to enter the city said modu zannari who lives nearby
boko haram gunmen in their hundreds attacked jintilo around five a.m. just before the morning prayers but soldiers stationed there fought back zannari said
since five a.m. all we hear are cracking of guns and booming explosions coming from the direction of jintilo said babakaka said a resident of another neighborhood near the scene of the fighting
there have been radio announcements of indefinite curfew in the city and we have all been asked to remain indoors said adam kolo who lives in the heart of the city
hundreds of troop reinforcements deployed in jintilo and military jets carried out aerial bombardment of boko haram positions said a member of a civilian vigilante group fighting boko haram alongside troops
the gunmen have been dealt with and are now on the run but they are being pursued by soldiers and vigilantes with the aerial support of a military jet said the vigilante who asked not to be named because he was not authorized to speak on the incident
the attack came a day after president goodluck jonathan made a campaign stop in maiduguri ahead of the february fourteen presidential election
he has promised to end the boko haram insurgency if re elected
on friday boko haram attacked kambari village five kilometers from maiduguri killing fifteen people and burning homes in what was seen as a prelude to a possible onslaught on the city
also friday boko haram released one hundred and ninety two hostages mostly women who had been kidnapped from a village in yobe state following a deadly raid according to community leaders a local politician and a military source
the hostages had been held in two boko haram enclaves since a january six raid on the village of katarko twenty kilometers from the state capital damaturu in which two hundred and eighteen women and children were abducted according to sources
boko haram have returned to us our one hundred and ninety two women they took away at the beginning of this month
they freed them on friday and dropped them at girbuwa near damaturu diptcha aisami a community leader in katarko said
the hostages were released after they declined to fight alongside boko haram which branded them infidels said a local politician from katarko
they are still holding twenty six young boys they abducted along with the released hostages in katarko said the politician who asked not to be named for security reasons
a military officer confirmed the release of the hostages by boko haram
on january six dozens of boko haram gunmen stormed katarko where they killed twenty five men and threw the bodies in open wells burned the entire village and kidnapped the women and children according to aisami and local vigilantes
the attack was apparently in reprisal for a raid on a boko haram enclave by local hunters and vigilantes in buni yadi twenty kilometers away hours earlier
several boko haram fighters were killed in that raid
scores of others were arrested and an arsenal was seized according to vigilantes

we have no interest in seeing russia weakened or its economy in shambles
we have a profound interest as i believe every country does in promoting a core principle which is
large countries don't bully smaller countries obama told reporters
speaking in new delhi after a lengthy flight on air force one obama said sunday he will look at all the additional options that are available to us short of military confrontation
on monday obama will be the first u.s. leader to headline india's annual republic day parade a colorful military spectacle featuring marching bands dancing and lots of heavy machinery rolling down the stately rajpath boulevard
the parade will be a reminder of the decades of sometimes tense relations between india and the u.s. a military demonstration at heart the vehicles and equipment parading before obama will be mostly russian made a vestige of india's stance during the cold war
russia remains india's largest supplier of weapons and while their share is steadily decreasing russian military imports still amount to three quarters of india's stockpile
with u.s. russia relations worsening to cold war levels obama hopes to balance moscow's influence in india during his visit this week
his visit comes a day after city officials in mariupol ukraine said shelling in southeastern ukraine killed at least thirty people including two children
another one hundred and two people were injured at least seventy five of whom needed hospital treatment and many suffered shrapnel injuries mariupol city council said
pro russian separatists are blamed for the attack on residential areas in the port city donetsk regional police chief vyacheslav abroskin said on his facebook page
monitors with the organization for security and co operation in europe said they conducted a crater analysis which showed the use of grad and uragan rockets that likely originated from areas controlled by the pro russian rebel group donetsk people's republic
the shelling comes amid a surge in fighting between government forces and pro russian separatists
u.s. secretary of state john kerry and russian foreign minister sergey lavrov discussed ukraine and syria during a phone call the state department said
on ukraine the secretary reiterated our condemnation of the separatists grad missile attack on civilians in mariupol
and other separatist attacks a statement said
the secretary reiterated the need for an immediate resumption of the ceasefire a withdrawal of heavy weapons and closing the border
he also underscored u.s. readiness to participate in serious settlement efforts making clear that deescalation is in everyone's interests that russia will be judged by its actions and that the costs to russia will only increase if attacks continue
kerry has previously warned of increased international pressure on russia
we call on russia to end its support for separatists immediately close the international border with ukraine and withdraw all weapons fighters and financial backing kerry said in a statement saturday
the white house says vice president joe biden spoke with ukraine president petro poroshenko on saturday
they expressed grave concern over russia's blatant disregard for its commitments under the september minsk agreement and unilateral escalation of the conflict the white house said
thousands have been killed since the conflict broke out in the spring of last year
a ceasefire agreed to in september in minsk belarus crumbled long ago

u.s. companies are reluctant to construct nuclear plants in india if they aren't shielded from liability after accidents an assurance indian lawmakers have been unwilling to extend
president barack obama and prime minister narendra modi stopped short of announcing a full fledged deal but did say they'd moved forward on the issue
this is an important step that shows how we can work together to elevate our relationship obama said during a press conference that came after bilateral talks with modi
obama touched down in india on sunday for a truncated state visit that has officials claiming a new era in u.s. india relations is dawning
obama hopes to capitalize on his young friendship with modi to achieve diplomatic progress on climate defense and trade progress that has eluded u.s. leaders in the past
in a surprise break in protocol modi greeted obama on the tarmac on his arrival in new delhi and wrapped him in a hug
after a two leg sixteen hour journey air force one landed in new delhi under midmorning fog around ten a.m.
the overcast indian capital was heavily fortified with extra security for the president's trip
police and military guards armed with machine guns patrolled roads and manned checkpoints throughout the city
highways were shut well ahead of obama's arrival
the normally chaotic traffic scene was unusually serene hours before obama's landing
even the city's stray dogs and monkeys were being herded away from the routes obama's motorcade was scheduled to drive
a formal military presentation greeted obama at the indian president's residence and obama joined modi to lay a wreath at a memorial to mahatma gandhi
on monday obama will be the first u.s. leader to headline india's annual republic day parade a colorful military spectacle featuring marching bands dancing and lots of heavy machinery rolling down the stately rajpath boulevard
the white house says the invitation to act as the parade's honored guest came as a major shock and could open the way for new cooperation between new delhi and washington
obama himself sees the invitation as a transformational moment for u.s. india relations according to his aides
i think it goes without saying that this is a seminal moment in the bilateral relationship and that the extension of this invitation by the prime minister really continues to set a different tone for our reinvigorated partnership said phil reiner senior director for south asia on obama's national security council staff
but even the parade itself will act as a reminder of the decades of sometimes tense relations between the two countries
a military demonstration at heart the vehicles and equipment parading before obama on monday will be mostly russian made a vestige of india's stance during the cold war
russia remains india's largest supplier of weapons and while their share is steadily decreasing russian military imports still amount to three quarters of india's stockpile
with u.s. russia relations worsening to cold war levels obama hopes to balance moscow's influence in india during his visit this week
officials also hope to exact climate commitments in new delhi where air quality warnings remained in place even during obama's visit
that's a contrast to obama's trip late last year to beijing where roads were cleared and the air cleansed of its usual smog ahead of the president's arrival
in china obama was able to secure historic carbon reduction promises from the new premier there though expectations for similar achievements in india were more measured
indians working in the capital city on sunday said they regarded obama's visit as a highly symbolic gesture from the united states one they said was well received despite the security headaches that his arrival caused
local television networks profiled weavers preparing elaborate gold threaded saris for first lady michelle obama who is accompanying her husband for the three day state visit
the pair had planned to visit the taj mahal in agra whose origins as a memorial to a mughal emperor's wife have made it a romantic draw for couples
the side trip was nixed however so obama and the first lady could fly to riyadh to pay respects to the late saudi king abdullah


london's royal free hospital announced saturday that pauline cafferkey has been discharged from the royal free following her recovery from ebola
on december twenty nine the thirty nine year old glasgow scotland resident became the first person to be diagnosed with the virus on uk soil shortly after returning from sierra leone
five days later the royal free hospital announced her condition had deteriorated to critical
that meant all the more reason to celebrate saturday's news
prime minister david cameron was among those weighing in tweeting great to hear pauline cafferkey has been discharged from hospital
thank you to everyone royalfreenhs for the world class care
cafferkey contracted ebola while working with save the children at an ebola treatment center according to michael von bertele humanitarian director at that organization
british media outlets said cafferkey is a public health nurse in scotland's south lanarkshire area who was part of a thirty strong team of medical volunteers deployed to west africa by the uk government last month in a joint endeavor with save the children
she traveled via casablanca morocco and london heathrow airport before arriving at glasgow airport on a british airways flight late last year the health agency nhs scotland said
after feeling unwell she sought medical attention and became the first person to be diagnosed with ebola within the united kingdom
she was reportedly transferred to london in a military aircraft fitted with an isolation pod and brought to the royal free hospital
that facility has a high level isolation unit with access restricted to specially trained medical staff
a specially designed tent with controlled ventilation is set up over the patient's bed
as she got treatment there save the children said that it was doing everything possible to establish how cafferkey contracted ebola and had been conducting a review since she was confirmed as having the virus



one of the first statements she made before making a direct plea to isis to spare her son's life was an apology to the japanese people
thank you for your great kindness and i apologize for the tremendous inconvenience and trouble that my son has caused she said
the plea came just before a seventy two hour deadline for a two hundred million dollar ransom set in the video was due to expire
the japanese government appears not to have given into the demand and a day later her son appeared again this time holding a photo that purported to show the decapitated body of his compatriot haruna yukawa
now the jihadist group is demanding the release of sajida al rishawi a female terrorist being held in jordan in exchange for goto's life
ishido's public apology is understandable in the context of japanese society says jeff kingston director of asian studies at temple university's tokyo campus
in japan when you inconvenience people it's important to respect them and ask for forgiveness kingston says
ishido conveyed several times how badly she feels about her son's capture causing trouble for the japanese government and alarm for its people
to her it doesn't matter that her son was likely trying to rescue his friend and fellow hostage haruna yukawa
it doesn't matter than he has been praised by friends colleagues and strangers for reporting sensitively from war zones like syria with strong respectful determination
if she were to say such things publicly in japan she could be perceived as a selfish individual who touts the righteousness of her son
because of this ishido a desperate mother with a son in imminent danger of brutal murder at the hands of a militant jihadist group apologized to her country from the bottom of my heart
and then begged for help
i plead to the japanese government to save kenji's life ishido said
to all members of isis kenji is not the enemy of isis
please release him
kingston says public sympathy for the two hostages is mixed partly because of their vastly different backgrounds
there's a distinction in the public between goto and yukawa kingston told cnn ahead of the news of yukawa's apparent murder
there is a great deal of respect for the journalist and what he's done and his experience
yukawa is looked at as a nave adventurer who put himself in harm's way
so many are asking why should it be the government and the taxpayer's problem
in two thousand and four three young japanese hostages were released by militants in iraq
instead of being welcomed home they were shunned for causing trouble for japan
the former hostages including one who was in iraq helping children before her capture were even billed by the government for their airfare
they got the frostiest unwelcome you can imagine
it was essentially government encouraged bullying kingston says adding the trauma of their return was in some ways worse than their capture
in the previous hostage crisis under japan's former prime minister junichiro koizumi during the iraq war language like self responsibility and go at your own risk was engraved into the japanese psyche
for most japanese citizens areas of the middle east ravaged by conflict are perceived as distant dangerous places the opposite of the safety and calm that permeates japanese society
many in japan don't understand why anyone would leave the island nation and travel to such hostile regions where they face potential capture by terror groups like isis
therefore many find it difficult to sympathize with those who choose to go
goto has received more sympathy because the japanese media has widely reported on his commitment to telling the stories of suffering women and children
according to his own online posts yukawa was a troubled man and as such he has received far less sympathy back home in japan
he lost his wife to cancer and then his home and business to bankruptcy
at one point he attempted suicide and took a traditionally female name
on the outside i look normal he wrote in one post
but inside i'm mentally ill
it seems he went to the middle east looking for a fresh start and wanted to be a private security contractor even though he had no experience
he's seen as irresponsible kingston says
kingston adds this latest incident has the potential to change the way japanese society feels about prime minister shinzo abe's approach of proactive pacifism
the isis video was released just two days after abe was in the middle east pledging two hundred million dollar in humanitarian aid to the coalition against isis a commitment the japanese government insists it will honor no matter what happens to the hostages
however the public might feel about the two men who they watched kneel in the desert on their computers and tv screens there is no doubt that the sight of their countrymen enduring capture at the hands of isis has brought the situation in iraq and syria into sharp relief
islamic extremism was something you watched on tv that happened to other people kingston says
and now it's happening to the japanese

yet nowadays this region is especially turbulent with waves rocking several countries so big that their effects are being felt worldwide including the west
it's not like this uneasiness is concentrated only in one country or all for a common reason
there's islamic extremism political turnover faltering oil prices and let's not forget age old sectarian tensions that are contributing in different ways in different places to the tumult
many countries in the region have issues such as egypt's delicate political and human rights situation and turkey's dealing with the impact of the war raging right over its border in syria
still a few stand out because of the unique some might say intractable challenges they face
chaos is one way to describe it
the country's government is in a shambles
violence some of it sectarian some of it thanks to militancy from al qaeda in the arabian peninsula has been raging nationwide for months if not years
and it's far and away the poorest nation in the region with a per capita gdp of one thousand four hundred and seventy three dollar according to the world bank
let's start with the still unfolding political crisis
yemen's president and prime minister abruptly resigned thursday after houthi rebels moved on the capital sana'a
how yemen's new government will look is still unclear if it's going to have a functioning government at all
if the houthis take the lead that would mean shiites ruling a country that's mostly sunni
while the houthis and previous government both fought against al qaeda this instability can only help that terror group
and none of this is helping the average yemeni stuck in poverty with little time money or effort seemingly focused on improving their straits or the economy as a whole
why it matters to the west and beyond
for the rest of the world political stability is a good thing for any country in this region
on the flip side instability is always a concern
there's also the fact that yemen has enough oil and natural gas for its people and export though unrest makes it challenging to tap into these resources the u.s. energy information administration notes
all those worries and impacts are real
but for the west it's about aqap
ever since osama bin laden was flushed out of afghanistan the terrorist organization he founded has spread out and evolved
rather than one overarching entity al qaeda is now more of an association of groups each with its own goals even if they all share a philosophy of lashing out at the west and promoting their extreme brand of islam
and of those aqap is widely considered the most dangerous to the west
it's the only al qaeda affiliate to send terrorists from yemen to the united states
there was umar farouk abdulmutallab better known as the underwear bomber for his attempt to blow up a commercial airliner on a detroit bound flight in december two thousand and nine
then there are the suspects in the deadly boston marathon bombings and nidal hassan who reportedly were inspired by american born cleric and top aqap figure anwar al awlaki
the united states isn't the only place affected
aqap has claimed to be behind the january seven charlie hebdo massacre and one of the brothers involved cherif kouachi told cnn affiliate bfm that he trained in yemen on a trip financed by al awlaki
al awlaki is dead but his organization is not
with both yemen's government and the houthis focused on each other aqap has more space to recruit and train terrorists as well as devise ways for them to strike
yemen's political upheaval is especially unsettling for countries like the united states which had a strong working alliance with now departed president abdu rabu mansour hadi and his government
as of thursday u.s. officials haven't held any talks with the houthis nor did they know their intentions
since its founding in one thousand nine hundred and thirty two the kingdom of saudi arabia has been one of the most stable not to mention richest countries in not just the middle east but the world
it had a new new leader friday and let's just say the timing could have been better
saudi arabia has had political transition before with six kings in its modern day history the latest being king salman who took power friday following the death of his half brother king abdullah bin abdulaziz
the new leader has already signaled that he won't diverge much from his predecessor's policies saying we will with god's will and power adhere to the straight path this country has followed since its establishment
still change is change and king salman will be challenged from the get go
riyadh has long played a part in stabilizing the region a role that is needed as much as ever
iraq is battling isis militants who already control much of the country and are threatening to take the rest
the sunni led government in neighboring yemen is out with uncertainty of what comes next or whether some of its violence will spill over into saudi
and there's the threat from across the persian gulf in iran
on top of all this the price of the arab nation's economic driver oil has plummeted over fifty percents since the summer to less than fifty dollar a barrel
that's key because oil revenues are a bit part of saudi government's revenues and a big reason it's so important on the world stage
why it matters to the west and beyond
the middle east is unstable enough especially since the arab spring
the saudi government was one a few regional governments to weather that storm smoothly
but now there's even more need for stability something that having a new leader may not help with
it is very possible that saudi policy doesn't change much under king salman
even if that's true it's much too early to tell whether or not he can be a leader throughout the region
can or will he try to help broker peace between palestinians and israel as did king abdullah 
can or will he be able to have any influence keeping yemen under control 
likewise it's not yet clear how the transition will affect the saudi government's relationship with the united states whose leaders have long been able to count on riyadh for counsel and support
another possible impact of king salman's ascension has nothing to do with geopolitics but rather how much you pay at the gas pump
the new king could decrease the amount of oil pumped in saudi arabia which would decrease supply and increase prices
even without any saudi action the price of oil has already started climbing after king abdullah's death
syria's upheaval began in spring two thousand and eleven with protests in the nation's streets
president bashar al assad's government responded with a deadly crackdown an act that only seemed to fuel the unrest
and it only got worse from there
eventually the dissension and violence devolved into a full fledged civil war
it's been a bloody war with the united nations estimating nearly two hundred thousand killed as of last august
it's been a disruptive war with more than three million syrians now refugees and at least six point five million more displaced inside the country
and it hasn't been a simple war given all the warring parties involved
that's because there isn't just one united opposition group fighting against al assad who is still in power and entrenched in damascus
there are more moderate fighting groups some of which have gotten support from washington and beyond
and there are extremists who have been able to attract new recruits gain more influence and take over territory amid the chaos
one of them is al nusra front an al qaeda affiliate the u.s. state department has designated a terrorist organization that's taken over territory in northwestern syria
another is isis which first emerged in iraq but got a second life in syria thanks to the ongoing war
it has terrorized many in both countries in recent months a time in which its taken over vast swaths of territory established a de facto capital in the syrian city of raqaa and rebranded itself the islamic state in accordance with its quest to be a caliphate governed under its strict interpretation of sharia law
why it matters to the west and beyond
even before isis made daily headlines the horrors of what's been happening in syria was enough to get the world's attention
with large numbers of civilians dying with the alleged use of chemical weapons with neighboring countries like turkey and jordan finding themselves swarmed by refugees it couldn't be avoided from a practical and personal standpoint
none of those concerns have gone away
syria borders turkey a nato member as well as jordan and israel two staunch u.s. allies
besides the refugee issue there is a constant threat that the violence will spill over the syrian border
even without that a seemingly endless civil war in this part of the world is never good for most anyone the west included
it's not just that there's violence it's who is behind it and in many ways thriving because of it
isis wouldn't be what it is without the syrian civil war
that means it wouldn't be a focal point for u.s. president barack obama and his government
already isis has beheaded a number of u.s. and british hostages all of them civilians and threatened more
there's also the real threat that the group may take its campaign out of the middle east to strike in the west
that may have happened this month in france
one of the three terrorists there amedy coulibaly proclaimed his allegiance to isis in a video and investigators discovered isis flags along with automatic weapons detonators and cash in an apartment he rented france's rtl radio reported sunday citing authorities
the west and some of its middle eastern allies are striking back with targeted airstrikes not only in iraq where the coalition has a willing partner but in syria where it is not working with al assad
u.s. diplomatic officials said thursday that estimates are that this coalition has killed more than six thousand isis fighters
yet their work is far from done
the group boasts upwards of thirty one thousand fighters not to mention fresh recruits seemingly coming in regularly
iraq is no stranger to war in recent decades from its war with iran in the one thousand nine hundred and eighty s to the first gulf war in the early one thousand nine hundred and ninety s to a u.s. led invasion in two thousand and three
and it has seen plenty of bad actors in that stretch like late leader saddam hussein who used chemical weapons against his enemies including the one thousand nine hundred and eighty eight attack on the kurdish town of halabja
even then isis stands out
the group began in two thousand and four as al qaeda in iraq a particularly destructive arm of bin laden's terror network with an affinity for attacking coalition forces as well as those locals who didn't accept this sunni group's extreme islamic beliefs
international military efforts helped to beat back the group but it never totally went away
rebranded as the islamic state the terror group came back stronger and seemingly more brazen than ever
it killed and kidnapped including many civilians using tactics so extreme that even al qaeda disowned it
members of the minority yazidi group reported being treated like cattle as their men were slaughtered and their women and girls were raped and sold
it distributed a pamphlet in mosul justifying its enslaving and having sex with unbelieving women and girls
it's not just that isis is despicable
it's been successful
the terror group has taken over large tracts of territory in iraq including oil fields and the key city of mosul and even threatened its capital of baghdad
why it matters to the west and beyond
iraq matters because it has been a place where islamist extremists can strike the west
for years that meant attacking coalition military forces based there
now that they are gone the fear is that iraq will become a training ground for isis militants to prepare for strikes outside the middle east
that's why in august obama authorized the first of what have come to be hundreds of targeted airstrikes conducted with international allies to counter militants in iraq as well as syria
it appears to have made a difference not only in killing the estimated six thousand isis fighters but in helping iraqi forces reclaim territory
u.s. secretary of state john kerry said thursday that iraq has taken back more than two hundred and seventy square miles
iraqi prime minister haider al abadi told cnn's christiane amanpour this week he expects isis even if it is not eliminated entirely should be gone from his country within months claiming the group's onslaught
has been reversed
i think we have the capability now with enough support from the international coalition al abadi said
any such predictions need to be taken with a grain of salt
that's especially true in iraq where terrorists have been reportedly ousted before only to return
plus it is not as though the end of isis necessarily will signal an end to iraq's problems
like saudi arabia this big time oil producer has to cope with the impact of lower prices
and there was violence before isis surge including a good number of terrorist attacks so it seems unrealistic to expect that will go away
the islamic revolution happened in one thousand nine hundred and seventy nine
there has been occasional protests since then but none have amounted to anything
in some ways politically iran has been the picture of stability with two overarching leaders in the past thirty six years with ayatollah ruhollah khomeini and his successor ali khamenei
yet iran's relations with the rest of the world haven't been so calm
part of it has to do with iranian leaders hard line stance against israel as illustrated in ayatollah khamenei's nine point explanation last november for why israel should be annihilated
the ayatollah and his supporters haven't been much kinder to the united states with spirited anti american rallies and harsh criticisms of washington common
then there's iran's nuclear program one that since two thousand and three has fueled concern worldwide that tehran's plans are not simply energy development as iranian officials have said but may be to develop nuclear warheads that could strike israel and beyond
this dispute has led to major sanctions on iran hurting that nation's economy and isolating it from much of the world
but there's been some signs of hope since the two thousand and thirteen election of president hassan rouhani
since then the rhetoric has notably calmed
and while there's been no conclusive deal at least iran has engaged in constructive talks with western officials on the nuclear issue
why it matters to the west and beyond
think of it this way
would you want leaders of a country known for death to america chants to have a nuclear weapon 
the united states sure does not
nor do its european allies
and certainly neither does israel
one concern is that all of these recent negotiations are simply smokescreens
iran some skeptics say may be inching closer to producing nuclear weapons behind everyone's backs while they talk peace
and it's not as though every leader in iran is embracing peaceful rhetoric
nuclear weapons or not seemingly anything could tip the scales toward war
the latest point of contention relates to an israeli attack in syria's golan heights that killed a senior iranian commander and six hezbollah members
speaking about that incident thursday according to state run press tv the iranian revolutionary guard's brig
gen. hossein salami said
should be waiting for crushing responses
israel is one of most modern progressive prosperous countries
but ever since its founding in one thousand nine hundred and forty eight it has also been one of the most challenged when it comes to security and that hasn't changed
hamas and israeli forces fought for seven weeks this summer in gaza a conflict that killed more than two thousand one hundred and thirty palestinians most of them civilians according to the united nations
sixty seven israelis sixty four of them soldiers have been killed the u.n. reported
a foreign worker in israel was killed as well
the violence has died down since then but it hasn't gone away
there was a november attack at a jerusalem synagogue that killed four worshipers and a police officer
an israeli soldier was stabbed to death on a tel aviv street with another killed at a west bank hitchhiking post
many palestinians have been caught up in everything as well like a senior palestinian authority official who died after a confrontation with israeli troops
no three rd intifada yet but few signs of hope either
meanwhile there's an election coming up in israel
prime minister benjamin netanyahu is contending to stay in the office he's held since two thousand and nine hoping to convince voters that he's the right person to address a faltering economy recent attacks against israelis in jerusalem and this summer's inconclusive war against hamas
in fact he's taking his appeal on the road to the united states
house speaker john boehner has invited netanyahu to speak to congress on march three
but he won't be meeting with obama then a fact that some see as the latest evidence of the reportedly frosty relationship between the two leaders
why it matters to the west and beyond
israel is important to the united states for a few reasons
some of that has to do with the countries common democratic ideals
there is also the shared strategic and security interests as it is no coincidence that many of israel's foes are also u.s. enemies
and there's a political component as well with many in the united states valuing the country's relationship with israel and sometimes poking their political opponents claiming they're not sufficiently supportive
if the leaders of these two longtime allies aren't on the same page that could be a problem
obama won't personally meet with netanyahu during his next visit because white house spokesman josh earnest said we want to avoid even the appearance of any kind of interference with a democratic election on march seventeen
then there's the prospect that netanyahu will press for stronger sanctions on iran
this thrusts him into the u.s. political fray since the iran talks have pitted obama against republicans and democrats alike
this visit certainly won't help mend what aaron david miller a former u.s. middle east peace negotiator has described as a dysfunctional relationship between netanyahu and obama
as a senior official with a prominent pro israel policy organization in washington said last fall
these guys don't like each other
they don't pretend to like each other

another one hundred and two people were injured at least seventy five of whom needed hospital treatment and many suffered shrapnel injuries mariupol city council said
pro russian separatists are blamed for the attack on residential areas in the port city donetsk regional police chief vyacheslav abroskin said on his facebook page
the interior ministry said one person was arrested in connection with the attack
based on preliminary assessments the shells were fired from grad rocket systems a statement from mariupol city council said
the statement also said the situation was under control and urged residents not to panic but to rely on information from official sources only
monitors with the organization for security and co operation in europe said they conducted a crater analysis which showed the use of grad and uragan rockets that likely originated from areas controlled by the pro russian rebel group donetsk people's republic
the shelling comes amid a surge in fighting between government forces and pro russian separatists
u.s. secretary of state john kerry warned of increased international pressure on russia
we call on russia to end its support for separatists immediately close the international border with ukraine and withdraw all weapons fighters and financial backing kerry said in a statement
the white house says vice president biden spoke with ukraine president poroshenko on saturday
they expressed grave concern over russia's blatant disregard for its commitments under the september minsk agreement and unilateral escalation of the conflict the white house said
the two leaders vowed to ensure that the costs continue to rise on russia for its aggressive actions against ukraine
thousands have been killed since the conflict broke out in the spring of last year and a ceasefire agreed to in september in minsk belarus crumbled long ago
u.s. officials took to twitter to condemn the latest violence
today's indiscriminate shelling of mariupol part of an apparently russian backed general offensive in complete violation of minsk agreements said u.s
ambassador to ukraine geoffrey pyatt
russia's escalation continues kremlin's callous disregard for human life on full display in ukraine said daniel baer the u.s. ambassador to the organization for security and cooperation in europe
the foreign ministers of ukraine and russia met this week in berlin to discuss a way out of the violence
but despite the talks violence in the breakaway donetsk and luhansk regions shows no sign of abating
thursday's shelling of a transit stop in donetsk city an attack that ukraine's defense ministry blamed on rebels killed eight civilians according to state news reports
but ukrainian troops have come under heavy fire as well
that includes one hundred and fifteen attacks in a recent twenty four hour period that killed three troops and wounded fifty more ukrinform the ukrainian national news agency reported friday
the osce monitoring mission in ukraine condemned continuing fighting in civilian areas in a statement saturday and urged both sides to refrain from using force in such areas including near donetsk airport
using residential areas as firing positions attracts counter firing to these areas further endangering the lives of civilians it said
all parties need to take robust and immediate action in order to end the new escalation in fighting and its heavy toll on civilians
ukraine and the west accuse russia of sending troops and equipment over the border
in a bid to put pressure on moscow over ukraine the united states and european union have imposed financial sanctions against russian interests
wednesday for instance ukrainian president petro poroshenko said more than nine thousand russian troops our russian ukrainian border bring with them hundreds and hundreds of tanks armed personnel carriers and killing ukrainian civilians and attacking ukrainian troops
russian president vladimir putin blamed the wave of recent casualties on those giving the order to fire in heavily populated areas in remarks reported by the state run itar tass news agency friday
those who give such criminal orders bear responsibility for this
people doing that should know that there is no other way of resolving such conflicts than peace negotiations and political measures he said
putin also suggested ukraine was not interested in finding a peaceful resolution to the crisis and said he hoped common sense would prevail
the conflict in eastern ukraine broke out after russia annexed ukraine's southeastern crimea region as pro russia separatists claimed control of the luhansk and donetsk regions
from mid april two thousand and fourteen to january twenty one the conflict killed at least five thousand and eighty six people and injured at least ten thousand nine hundred and forty eight others according to the united nations
we fear that the real figure may be considerably higher the office of the u.n. high commissioner for human rights said about the death toll in a report released friday
no truce with ukraine rebel leader says

relief is palpable in washington over the well planned and seamlessly executed transfer of saudi arabia's throne to king salman bin abdulaziz seventy nine following the death of his ninety year old half brother king abdullah
the kingdom despite signaling rare public dissent with the obama administration over iran and the arab spring is a fulcrum of u.s. diplomacy in a region where washington is struggling to adapt to dissolving national borders chaotic change and sectarian carnage
never mind that the u.s. is the world's foremost democracy and the transfer of power in saudi arabia was from one autocrat to the next
saudi arabia is crucial to u.s. goals on counter terrorism the campaign against isis and al qaeda the free flow of energy that sustains the global economy as a counter balance to iran and as a sponsor of the long frustrated quest for peace between israel and the palestinians
in a sign of the kingdom's importance to the united states president barack obama made hurried plans to call in saudi arabia on tuesday after his trip to india to pay his respects to abdullah and his family and to meet with king salman
originally vice president joe biden was to have made the trip
the message from washington is clearly
long live the new king
the regal choreography in riyadh is especially welcome to the white house as it contrasts with events just across the border in yemen another key ally where a us backed government crucial to its anti terror campaign has just been toppled to rebels supported by iran
james b. smith who served as u.s. ambassador to saudi arabia between two thousand and nine and two thousand and thirteen said there should be no concern in the administration that salman's ascension will jeopardize u.s. relations with the deeply conservative kingdom
we know salman well he was governor of riyadh for the better part of fifty years he is well known to the us government
i see no break in the u.s. saudi relationship smith said
salman vowed just hours after the death of abdullah that the kingdom would continue adhering to the correct policies which saudi arabia has followed since its establishment
state department spokeswoman jen psaki said that the allies had a long history of cooperation
we don't have any indication that that cooperation will change
saudi watchers in washington were impressed and reassured by the line of succession outlined by salman in an apparent effort to solve a dynastic riddle and send a signal of continuity to the outside world
he named prince mohammed bin nayef one of scores of posssible candidates as deputy crown prince a move which puts him second in line to the throne and establishes a future transfer of power from the sons of the founder of saudi arabia king abdulaziz ibn saud who have ruled the country since the one thousand nine hundred and fifty s to a new generation
i think for the near term continuity is going to be the centerpiece here said daniel benjamin a former coordinator for counter terrorism at the state department now at dartmouth college told cnn
there is now a member of the generation of the grandchildren who is second in line he is a very close friend of the united states
so i think there is a lot of hope the relationship will stay on an even keel
prince mohammed now behind the king's brother prince muqrin sixty nine in the line of succession is a frequent visitor to the united states and has presided over saudi arabia's anti terrorism program
he narrowly escaped an assassination bid by al qaeda in two thousand and nine
the succession plan was viewed as particularly important following unconfirmed reports that salman has been in ill health himself apparently having suffered a stroke
tom donilon pointman for us relations with saudi arabia when he was obama's national security advisor praised abdullah as a solid ally who had ensured two decades of stability in the kingdom
he also said that the late king's survivors had done a pretty effective job of indicating stability with a quick annoncement with repect to succession continuity of policy
he told the lead with cnn's jake tapper that mohammad known as mbn in the united states was a very very competent person who is essential in terms of our joint efforts to combat terrorists
though there is relief at the apparent stability in riyadh relations between the united states and saudi arabia in recent years have have often been troubled
there was a tense period a decade ago after it emerged that fifteen of the nineteen hijackers involved in the september eleven attacks originated from saudi arabia
critics including some in the u.s. government faulted saudis for backing jihadists movements throughout the region for geopolitical reasons
the saudi government has also balked at u.s. criticisms of its human rights record and political system
more recently saudi arabia the key sunni power in the middle east has not hesitated to make clear its concern about obama's quest to improve relations with its mighty shia foe iran with which it is fighting various proxy struggles
saudi leaders were dismayed to learn about a secret backchannel of talks between the administration and iran which built on the election of moderate iranian president hassan rouhani in two thousand and thirteen to launch an effort at rapprochment between tehran and washington
i think that the concern remains among the saudi leadership about an agreement that is going to be at their expense said david ottaway an author on saudi arabia and senior scholar at the wilson center
some analysts believe that the saudi government could react to what it would see as a bad nuclear deal between world powers and iran which left the islamic republic with some capacity to enrich uranium or produce plutonium by looking to find its own nuclear capability perhaps with assistance from pakistan
saudi princes took to the op ed pages of us newspapers in two thousand and thirteen in a highly unusual move to complain that a nuclear deal was a dangerous gamble
the saudi government also made clear its deep anger with obama's last minute decision not to launch planned air strikes on syria to punish the bashar al assad regime's use of chemical weapons the same year
saudi arabia has also been frustrated at how long it has taken the united states to begin training opposition fighters in syria
anger at obama comments on the arab spring
the saudi government also registered anger at the obama administration's embrace of arab spring uprisings which led to the ouster of allies like egyptian president hosni mubarak
obama appeared to make an oblique reference to those differences in a statement honoring abdullah on thursday as a steadfast and passionate believer in us saudi relations as a force for stability
as a leader he was always candid and had the courage of his convictions obama wrote
in recent years the obama administration has attempted to assuage saudi fears
the us president made a visit to riyadh last year on a trip that was widely seen as an attempt to mend fences
saudi arabian pilots reportedly including one of salman's sons prince khaled helped carry out the first air attacks on isis in syria last year
saudi arabia also approved of secretary of state john kerry's exhaustive but ultimately futile efforts to keep israel and the palestinians talking
and white house spokesman josh earnest said that an underpinning of those efforts an arab peace plan framed by abdullah would stand as his lasting memorial
smith said that the relationship between riyadh and washington was now better than it had been earlier in the administration
a key element of our relationship with the saudis over the years has been transparency not always in public but we have done a good job in talking to each other he said
when you leave your allies out of the conversation and they don't understand your negotiating position or don't understand how you are going to enforce an agreement
they are left to their own conclusions
i think we are doing a lot better at that

the announcement from house speaker john boehner's office this week came after several high level interactions between u.s. and israeli officials including a phone call between obama and netanyahu and a multi hour meeting between secretary of state john kerry and israeli ambassador ron dermer a senior administration official told cnn
netanyahu's snub has once again soured relations between the two world leaders but u.s. officials insist the tensions won't affect u.s. support for israel
the boehner announcement came just over a week after obama spoke over the phone with netanyahu and urged him not to lobby in favor of new iran sanctions asking for some space a senior administration official said
but the hawkish israeli prime minister has a track record of supporting tougher sanctions against iran and he's expected to make that case when he addresses congress in march
obama and other world leaders negotiating with iran over its nuclear program have firmly argued against a sanctions bill from congress which they say would unravel a delicate international coalition and tank negotiations
we asked the israelis in private and public to sit tight and the president made clear if a deal wasn't reached he would be the first in line advocating for more sanctions the official said
that's what makes netanyahu's decision to address congress a pretty big deal the official added
and just a day before boehner's announcement kerry met for several hours with dermer who reportedly coordinated the visit between republican congressional leadership and netanyahu
but still there was no word of a netanyahu visit to washington
is this a smart way for them to manage the relationship 
a source close to kerry said
the bilateral relationship is unshakable but playing politics with that relationship could blunt secretary kerry's enthusiasm for being israel's primary defender
while u.s. and israeli officials insist publicly that the relationship has never been stronger and by most measures it remains very strong netanyahu's address to congress is just the latest in a string of diplomatic debacles that each time have sunk relations between the two leaders and their staff to new lows
netanyahu's continued expansion of jewish settlements in east jerusalem has angered u.s. officials prompting one senior white house official to call netanyhau a chickenshit in an october article in the atlantic that brought private tensions to light
obama's phone call with netanyahu and kerry's meeting with dermer just before the announcement give the snub a more personal veneer
kerry had made more than fifty calls in the preceding month to world leaders on the hot topics of israeli palestinian relations such as palestinian attempts to gain statehood through international organizations the source said adding that kerry's patience is not infinite
the in your face move from netanyahu's camp comes at a time when israel needs american support on the international stage with palestinians making a full court press to obtain statehood unilaterally through international institutions
another senior u.s. official said the israeli breach of protocol and diplomatic courtesy takes a toll on u.s. officials working strenuously to support israel on the international stage
they come to us with a lot of requests but don't have the courtesy of telling us 
that is what tipped it for us the official said
but again the core aspects of the relationship and commitment remain intact the official said
the snub may not sway the u.s.'s broad commitment to israel's security and to supporting israel in the international arena but netanyahu will feel the repercussions when he comes to washington in march without a ticket to the white house
the white house announced that obama won't meet with netanyahu during his visit because of the proximity to israeli elections
netanyahu will address congress just twelve days before the elections
he had asked to push back his visit by nearly a month
u.s. officials aren't the only ones taken aback
former israeli president shimon peres while refusing to directly criticize netanyahu conceded there are rules and norms how two countries have to behave
in that case i think the rules created differences and all of us have to look including our prime minister to go back to the basic rules and respect peres said in an interview in davos switzerland on saturday
it would come as no surprise that netanyahu's opponents in the election are harsher
his former finance minister and current competitor in the march election yair lapid said saturday that netanyahu is destroying our strategic relations with the united states for an election speech
yet ahead of the elections netanyahu's visit may be a boon for him and his party in israel as he plays himself up as the best protector of israel's security of which a relationship with the united states is a key factor
is that the relationship they want to have 
the senior administration official said
the last thing we want to do is hurt israel but if he is able to stiff the u.s. president like that and we still offer him a meeting that invites him and anyone else to do that over and over

the annual january twenty six parade celebrates the day in one thousand nine hundred and fifty when a newly independent republic of india adopted its first constitution
it's india's showiest moment of pride when patriotism trumps all and the nation lays out its culture accomplishments and military might for the world to see
this year president barack obama will see the festivities firsthand
he's the first u.s. leader india has invited to be the guest of honor and the first president to visit india twice in his tenure
that's a sign i believe of how far india has come from the nation of my childhood
back then i stood in the crowd thinking of things i learned in school about india's rich history and valiant struggle for freedom from british colonizers
but it was impossible to forget i was born in the third world
signs of poverty and despair were everywhere
i often heard this refrain
the east shall rise again
but i held no expectations no hopes really that my homeland would ever be any different
not in my lifetime
but over the last two decades i have been going home to a radically transformed india one that has experienced immense economic growth and social change
now obama is making history with his trip
he'll stand with prime minister narendra modi on rajpath the grand avenue that leads to india gate delhi's version of the arc de triomphe
obama will also be meeting modi for the second time within the span of a few months
the two met at the white house at the end of september on modi's first trip as prime minister to the united states
all this indicates india's arrival on the global stage
rick rossow of the center for strategic and international studies put it this way
it's a big deal
there's no better way to put it
modi's invitation to obama say india experts is a simple but extremely important gesture that could jump start relations between the two countries
modi's a controversial figure
some blame him for doing nothing to stop a massacre of muslims in gujarat the western indian state where he was chief minister
but indians voted him into the highest office of the land in a roaring landslide victory
they were fed up with years of stagnation and government corruption and in modi they saw the man who can again make india prosper
south asia expert milan vaishnav told me the white house has been waiting a long time to conduct business with india with confidence
in modi they believe they have found that elusive leader and they don't want to pass up the opportunity says vaishnav of the carnegie endowment for international peace
both india and the united states want a strong economy and a strong defense
a good guess is that the leaders of the world's two largest democracies will talk trade and terrorism
they are also likely to take up the issue of chinese dominance
besides japan india is america's strongest ally on that matter
we really talk about it more as not a counterweight to china but you want a multipolar asian future says rossow of csis
you know you want multiple sources of power in any jurisdiction and we would love for india to be because of course we've got an alignment of values
that last point got me thinking about india's growing prominence and what the world might look like fifty years from now in terms of power
america may not be the sole superpower anymore
and that refrain from my childhood could be ringing true after all
the east is rising
people in the west often talk about the emergence of india on the world stage
but that's because they don't know the history of my homeland
that for centuries india was one of the richest countries in the world until the british empire swallowed it up and left it destitute
the british even stole the famous kohinoor diamond and stuck it on the queen's crown
i recently read a story in the indian news magazine tehelka that mentioned a one thousand nine hundred and eighty three study of the world economy that created quite a stir among western economists
the study said that in one thousand seven hundred and fifty china owned thirty three percents of the global gdp and india twenty four point five percents
in the same year the combined share of britain and the united states was a mere two percents
a subsequent analysis found that india had the largest economy in the world for one thousand seven hundred of the past two thousand years
so to call india an emerging power is silly
if anything my homeland is re emerging as the global power it once was
india of course has a way to go to catch china although it has already outranked japan as the third largest economy
opinion
why two thousand and fifteen will be a defining year for india
economic historian robert fogel has predicted that by two thousand and forty the chinese economy will reach one hundred and twenty three dollar trillion
that's three times the economic output of the entire globe and quite staggering when you consider that china was considered a poor country in two thousand
fogel thinks china's per capita income will hit eighty five thousand dollar more than double the forecast for the european union
china's gdp at forty percents will dwarf america's fourteen percents
but some economists think that india has a chance to leap over china in about fifty years
the most recent world bank forecast says growth in india is likely to outdo china's 
granted it's a prediction that has been made before and india has disappointed
but now with modi in the driver's seat many experts are hopeful that india can resolve problems of political stasis and take off like it was supposed to have done a decade ago
india says rossow is destined to become another pole of power
india is a large country that will be population wise in the next twenty years probably surpassing china says rossow
economy wise it'll be a rival and growing quite heavily
that's why my city councilman in atlanta kwanza hall is visiting india
coincidentally he will be there at the same time as obama
i recently spoke with hall about why he is going on the state department sponsored trip
the geopolitics of the world and its economic focus has shifted and it will continue to shift east hall told me
india is a very significant player
hall of course is interested in strengthening indian business ties with the city of atlanta home to more than one hundred thousand south asian immigrants
he says he is impressed by the burgeoning middle class in india and by the fact that india is rooted in democracy unlike china
india has the advantage of leapfrogging its development says hall
indians are innovating above and beyond what was normal in the west and they have the advantage of learning from mistakes made by developed nations
they have a chance to address education poverty and heath care in a wholesale way says hall
whichever emerging superpower brings its people along the best will be the most dynamic
the human element is what people always leave out
obama says hall has every reason to reach out to modi a man who began as a chai wallah a tea seller and became prime minister of india
that after all is the american dream realized in the land of my birth

those arrested were two pairs of brothers interior minister jorge fernandez diaz told reporters saturday
what is especially noteworthy with the breakup of this cell are the many parallels with the attacks in paris recently carried out against the charlie hebdo magazine fernandez said referring to the january seven massacre that ended with twelve dead
ceuta is a tiny seven square mile spanish exclave bordering morocco across the strait of gibraltar from spain
the suspects who are spanish citizens and are of moroccan origin are strongly radicalized and had psychological and physical training as well as training in the use of weapons said the minister while addressing reporters at an event of his ruling conservative party
willing to carry out an attack fernandez said
and according to the police to blow themselves up

the static image shown in a video file posted by a known isis supporter shows surviving japanese hostage kenji goto alone in handcuffs and dressed in orange holding a photo of what appears to be beheaded compatriot haruna yukawa
japanese prime minister shinzo abe said sunday that the video is highly credible
u.s. authorities said they had no reason to doubt its authenticity
abe told japanese broadcaster nhk that the killing was abominable and unforgivable demanding the immediate release of goto
i still don't want to believe it shoichi yukawa said his face not shown in the report
if i can see him again i'd like to hold him in my arms
saturday's posting came four days after an isis video demanded that the japanese government pay two hundred million dollar within seventy two hours for the two hostages release
in the video released saturday the voice of a person claiming to be goto says in english that abe is to blame for yukawa's death
you were given a deadline he says
the voice then relays the apparent new demand from isis the release of sajida al rishawi a woman arrested in jordan in two thousand and five on suspicion of trying to take part in an attack in which others killed dozens at jordanian hotels
they no longer want money so you don't need to worry about funding terrorists the voice says
they are just demanding the release of their imprisoned sister sajida al rishawi
jordan's king abdullah ii and abe talked by phone on saturday according jordanian state news agency petra
the news agency did not detail what the two discussed beyond saying they reviewed the latest developments in the middle east
president barack obama condemned the purported murder of yukawa by isis
in a white house statement the president expressed condolences to the people of japan and said the united states will work with its ally to bring the perpetrators of these murders to justice and will continue to take decisive action to degrade and ultimately defeat isis
britain's prime minister david cameron said japan was right not to bow to the terrorists demand for ransom
britain strongly supports the firm stance prime minister abe and his government have taken and we will continue to work with japan and other partners around the world to promote peace and to build a safer more secure future for our citizens cameron said in a statement
secretary of state john kerry said the u.s. is grieving with yukawa's family
america has known this pain and horror ourselves and we stand with japan not just in sadness but in solidarity and strength he said in a statement
the u.s. national security council has seen saturday's post and the intelligence community is working to confirm its authenticity nsc deputy spokesman patrick ventrell said
goto forty seven and yukawa forty two had gone to the middle east for different reasons the former an experienced freelance journalist covering the conflict in iraq and syria and the latter an aspiring security contractor who felt at home in the war torn region
they ended up in the hands of isis in recent months
on tuesday isis released a photo showing a black clad masked man standing over goto and yukawa
the man made a demand
either japan pay two hundred million dollar the same amount that abe has proposed to help those affected by the isis campaign money his government says is for humanitarian rather than military purposes within seventy two hours or both men would die
japanese officials estimated that ultimatum expired at two fifty p.m. friday tokyo time with no immediate news on the hostages
saturday's video is dissimilar in some ways to last year's isis videos announcing the executions of western hostages
in five isis videos last year announcing the beheadings of u.s. journalists james foley and steven sotloff british aid worker david haines british taxi driver alan henning and u.s. aid worker peter kassig a masked man is shown making a statement and sometimes putting a knife to the hostages necks
the videos then transition to a still photo of the victims severed heads
al rishawi the woman named in the allegedly proposed swap for goto was arrested by jordanian authorities more than nine years ago
in november two thousand and five she said in a televised confession that she tried to take part in a string of terror attacks at jordanian hotels that month that killed at least fifty seven people
she said her explosives failed to go off at a large wedding reception she was targeting but that her husband's explosives did go off there
japan isn't part of the international military coalition that for months has been carrying out airstrikes against isis targets in iraq and syria
its post world war ii constitution forbids the use of japanese military forces for any purpose besides self defense
but tokyo is allied with the united states and others leading this military campaign
and japanese officials are offering help related to the ongoing unrest though they insist those millions of dollars would go toward things like helping refugees not killing isis militants
isis wasn't swayed
in tuesday's video demanding ransom a masked man holding a knife stood over the kneeling goto and yukawa and said that abe willingly volunteered to take part in this crusade against isis
a spokesman for the terror group according to japanese broadcaster nhk wouldn't comment this week on whether his group has been in touch with the japanese government something that officials in tokyo had said they were trying to arrange
he said he was aware that japan said it wasn't involved militarily and called the japanese infidels for fighting with the coalition
japanese officials had said they would not yield to threats but they would do everything they could to secure the hostages safe release
would that mean paying ransom 
officials weren't saying at least directly though abe did call isis demand unacceptable this week
leading japanese news organizations reported citing unidentified government sources that goto's wife received an e mail in december from someone demanding eight million dollar to sixteen million dollar for her husband's return
the government was trying to confirm if that e mail came from isis the reports said
if so it could indicate the militant group was willing to accept a smaller ransom than the two hundred million dollar it had publicly demanded
japanese citizens have been taken hostage before
some have been released
but what japan hasn't done is advertise whether it has ever paid ransom lest it encourage more kidnappings in bad guy fundraising schemes
it's not clear whether paying would have mattered
isis doesn't have representatives or go betweens everywhere who could solicit such a deal
nor does it have a reputation for morality and trustworthiness so there's no telling if it would have taken the money and killed anyway
and the fact the group publicly asked for two hundred million dollar a figure well above other ransom demands raised the prospect that it was never serious about negotiating
while there are certainly geopolitical implications this story is also about two men and the families they've left behind
as the apparent deadline approached goto's mother begged for her son's life
to all members of isis kenji is not the enemy of isis
please release him the mother junko ishido said friday

i have been just crying for the last three days filled with sadness
words fail to describe how i feel
kenji always has been a kind person ever since he was little
he was always saying i want to save the lives of children in war zones 
her son had been a journalist for years contributing to nhk and other japanese news organizations
goto covered big stories hoping that by telling them he could make a difference
that's what spurred him to go to isis controlled territory in syria as he explained in an october video shot shortly before he ventured over the turkish border
syrian people suffering three years and a half
it's enough said goto forty seven
so i would like to get the story of what isis wants to do
alaaeddin al zaim who had worked with goto in syria previously says he warned him not to enter the isis stronghold of raqqa
i tell him it's not safe for you al zaim told cnn
but goto went anyway
he said according to al zaim i am not american i am not british
i'm japanese
i can go
the aims and activities of yukawa a forty two year old unemployed widower are murkier
he originally headed to the war ravaged country early last year to gain combat and survival experience to bolster his plans to set up a private security company said his friend nobuo kimoto
there yukawa met goto who gave him insights on how to survive there kimoto said
goto also introduced him to rebel fighters who are distinct from isis though both are fighting syrian president bashar al assad's forces
some of the rebels talked about their need for ambulances to shuttle the wounded
that plea spurred yukawa to start raising money for this cause after returning to japan according to kimoto
kimoto said he advised his friend to focus on building up his private security company
before he went back to syria in july a month before his reported capture yukawa told his friend about his clear sense of purpose when he was in that tumultuous middle eastern nation despite all its violence and other travails
i felt a chill when he said after returning home he felt in syria he was really living a life kimoto said
he seems to have felt satisfaction being there and living together with the locals

vice president joe biden was originally set to have led a delegation to saudi arabia on obama's behalf
however the schedule for the president's departure from india has been adjusted to allow obama to stop in riyadh himself on his way home white house press secretary josh earnest said
funeral services were held friday for king abdullah bin abdulaziz al saud who died earlier that day
he was ninety
world leaders are now traveling to the saudi capital riyadh to offer condolences for abdullah's death and pay their respects to the new ruler
abdullah was seen by many as a cautious reformer who succeeded in securing broader freedoms in the conservative kingdom but fell short in gaining greater independence for women
his successor who is seventy nine faces a number of challenges as he takes up the reins including iran the rise of isis the crisis in neighboring yemen and the drop in oil prices
but salman has plenty of experience to draw on having served as defense minister and deputy prime minister of saudi arabia a vital u.s. ally in the middle east
like abdullah he is one of the dozens of sons of saudi arabia's founder king abdulaziz
obama is due to arrive in new delhi on sunday on a trip intended to foster progress in sometimes thorny u.s. india ties
on monday he will become the first american president to headline india's republic day parade standing beside indian prime minister narendra modi
why obama's trip to my homeland is meaningful
earnest said obama's schedule had been changed in coordination with the indian government and that he would now be leaving india after giving a speech on tuesday
the president regrets that he will be unable to visit agra during this trip earnest said
agra is where the spectacular taj mahal mausoleum is located
biden will now remain in washington rather than go to saudi arabia
although no reason for the change of plan was given it follows criticism this month of the obama administration for its failure to send a senior representative to france for a huge unity march held in the wake of the paris terror attacks
the administration admitted it erred and dispatched u.s. secretary of state john kerry to paris the following week to offer the united states support and condolences
speaking to cnn's richard quest in davos switzerland on friday kerry said he expects no changes in his government's relations with saudi arabia with the change of kings
i don't anticipate anything based on the conversation we have had no he said
jordan's king abdullah and egypt's president abdel fattah al sisi both left davos early to attend the funeral on friday
in line with custom abdullah was laid to rest in an unmarked grave in a brief and simple ceremony after funeral prayers in riyadh's imam turki bin abdullah grand mosque

the blues rock band announced friday that it's canceling seventeen shows in france germany the uk and other countries
the band hopes to resume the two thousand and fifteen turn blue tour as scheduled april two in brisbane australia
we are very sorry to have to cancel our upcoming performances through march ten
patrick needs time to heal co founders carney and guitarist dan auerbach said in a statement on the band's website
we thank all of our fans for their support and we're looking forward to getting back on the road
efforts to reschedule the dates were unsuccessful because of prior commitments and venue availability the band said
all tickets will be refunded in full at the point of purchase
the circumstances around carney's injury were not immediately disclosed although it was described as serious
the band had just posted a message on its site wednesday saying it will headline a festival may twenty eight in barcelona spain
formed in akron ohio in two thousand and one the black keys are essentially a duo auerbach and carney although they often supplement their live shows with other musicians
their raw sound gradually built them a devoted but modest following until brothers their two thousand and ten commercial breakthrough brought a mainstream audience
the band is best known for the hits lonely boy and gold on the ceiling from the two thousand and eleven el camino album
they have won six grammys and are up for three more this year including best rock album for their latest turn blue
the black keys were not scheduled to perform at the grammy awards to be handed out february eight in los angeles
they said friday that they do not expect any dates after march ten to be canceled
the black keys also are scheduled to play a handful of music festivals this summer

now as the tenuous ceasefire observed over the holidays falls apart the question is whether this latest violation of the minsk ceasefire agreement is the beginning of a separatist offensive to claim more territory
it certainly looks that way
on january thirteen the leaders of donetsk people's republic one of the two breakaway pro russian enclaves in ukraine's donbass region issued ukrainian troops an ultimatum to surrender donetsk airport
since then the long standing derelict control tower subject to months of shelling has finally collapsed and with it any likelihood that this conflict will stay frozen over the winter
the assault triggered a ukrainian counterattack and erupted into a full scale conflagration
ukraine's defense ministry has said it has withdrawn from the main terminal at donetsk airport but it is doubtful that separatist forces only have that in their sights anyway
after all although the site holds symbolic value for both sides it is a hulking ruin and of little strategic relevance
and the leader of dnr alexander zakharchenko has made clear he believes the borders of his breakaway republic should include the entire donetsk region which is double the current territory he controls
such ambitions are not likely to be realized during the freezing cold of january but separatist forces are now engaged in combat north of luhansk and as far south as mariupol
it is difficult to see russia's army sitting out on the sidelines as all this unfolds leaving the stage set for another battle between ukrainian and russian regular forces as ukraine's leadership and army are put to the test again
true the separatist force barely numbers twenty five thousand thirty thousand and only a fraction of it is combat capable
but the timing of this latest operation is clearly aimed at fostering instability in ukraine at a moment of economic weakness rather than taking advantage of any newfound military opportunity
ukraine's cash reserves fell to seven point five billion dollar in december while the political leadership is desperately awaiting a new tranche of funding from the imf without which ukraine may soon go bankrupt
meanwhile ukraine faces an incredibly difficult year due to gdp contraction inflation currency devaluation and anticipated fiscal austerity measures
since much of its army depends on volunteer donations to survive in the field prolonged fighting will create unbearable strain on the people and the country
and despite russia's economic woes as well as the impact of western sanctions nothing seems to have visibly constrained moscow's policies in ukraine
in retrospect it is clear russia had no intention of starting this year with negotiations rather than military action to change facts on the ground
russian leaders are for their part trapped in a dilemma of their own making
they are unable to secure russian influence in ukraine through the current agreement in a manner that relieves sanctions and satisfies separatist desires for a viable independent territory
ukraine's president petro poroshenko of course also lacks domestic political support for a genuine compromise with moscow having created a coalition government with his political rival
however it is russia that struggles under sanctions and must find a way out of the current situation
and unfortunately the only way out for moscow seems to be war
for russia the minsk agreement is a dead end
the fact is that it should be for the united states as well
making russia stick to this agreement despite its uselessness in achieving any path to settlement in the conflict is a negotiating position that is unrealistic and has run its course
the pressure of sanctions is insufficient to coerce russia away from using force meaning that instead of a diplomatic victory the west is witnessing ukraine cede more territory to the separatists
another defeat will shake its political system as well
how should the west respond 
the u.s. has no good choices only hard decisions to make
the first priority should be to negotiate a new ceasefire to end the bloodshed
if separatist goals are truly limited it should not take long
then the minsk agreement should be scrapped as a basis for settlement
that is far from ukraine's first choice but it is not in a position to expect best outcomes especially when its army is in retreat
meanwhile the west needs to work with russian and ukrainian leaders to come up with new terms
the framework will look similar to minsk but sanctions and economic woes have undoubtedly created strategic clarity in moscow about the need for this conflict to end this year
plus the latest fighting will change kiev's perspective as well
if all this proves unsuccessful then there is nothing to stop western leaders from providing more weapons to ukraine or imposing new hardships on russia
the latest fighting demonstrates the limits of what those policies might accomplish for ukraine
russia has not been brought to heel
it is time to try for a new peace settlement


thousands gathered in riyadh saudi arabia to pay their respects to king abdullah who died early on friday january twenty three



president abdu rabu mansour hadi's resignation thursday came after houthi rebels kidnapped his chief of staff seized control of key government buildings in the capital sanaa and failed to abide by provisions of a tentative peace deal hammered out wednesday
the chaos in yemen is cause for concern far beyond the country's borders
for the united states and its allies yemen's government has been a key ally in the fight against al qaeda in the arabian peninsula the yemen based group linked to attacks such as the recent slaughter at french magazine charlie hebdo
for the moment uncertainty rules
beyond it yawns the prospect of a political vacuum and growing sectarian rift that terror groups such as aqap could exploit
meda al rowas a senior analyst at ihs country risk told cnn that unless hadi is reinstated the chances of the country avoiding armed conflict are slim
our forecast is really civil war in yemen because we have a lot of nonstate armed groups who are likely to compete over territory and have a lot of competing agendas she said
who is in charge right now really depends on where in yemen you are she said
the houthis shiite muslims who have long felt marginalized in the majority sunni country have taken control of sanaa and the northern provinces of amran and sadaa
but there has already been resistance to their attempted takeover of national government institutions from different groups in yemen particularly in the south where there's a long running secessionist movement and in the oil rich province of marib to the east of sanaa
this really creates a situation where even if the houthis keep control over sanaa they have little chance of taking control of the whole country said al rowas
we expect to see armed resistance
it's possible that hadi himself a southerner could rescind his resignation and put a gulf cooperation council initiative for a negotiated transition of power back on track
but that seems unlikely at present
according to the national news agency saba yemen's parliament is due to hold an extraordinary session sunday called by parliament speaker yahya al rai
analysts suggest that because there's no vice president the speaker could be next in the line of succession taking on the role of acting president
he's close to former president ali abdullah saleh who clung to power until being forced out by international pressure two years ago
despite their takeover of sanaa it's unclear whether the houthis really want to take charge of the country
the group more likely wanted hadi to remain in power as a figurehead behind whom they could pull the strings without having to take on the burdensome business of governance said al rowas
under wednesday's failed peace deal the hadi government had agreed to rewrite parts of the country's constitution to give the houthis more political power in return for them withdrawing their militias from key government institutions and freeing the president's kidnapped aide
the government only finally got parliamentary approval in december said u.s. based yemen analyst sama'a al hamdani
hadi's resignation seems to be a recognition of the fact that he won't be able to lead the country as he wishes because of the houthi takeover she said
the houthis are shiites from northern yemen who make up about thirty percents of the population
they've been at war with the central government for the best part of a decade and are also fighting the sunni aqap
at the beginning of two thousand and fourteen they won a series of battles close to the saudi border
and in september houthi fighters suddenly descended on sanaa where they took over government buildings the main airport and a share of power
in the past week they've taken it to another level
although they have been fighting aqap they are no friend to the united states
one of the main slogans of this historically iranian backed group is death to america
the houthis have more recently forged an alliance with supporters of former president saleh said al rowas
this facilitated the houthis southward expansion but the alliance is fragile she said not least because saleh in the past waged military campaigns against the houthis
al qaeda's yemen affiliate aqap is perhaps the best known group internationally
it first emerged in saudi arabia in two thousand and two but thanks to the efforts of saudi authorities was a mostly a spent force by two thousand and five according to analysis from jane's world insurgency and terrorism
it re emerged reinvigorated in yemen in two thousand and nine after the saudi outfit merged with a yemeni al qaeda counterpart
besides battling the yemeni government and houthis it has been involved in international terror attacks including the failed two thousand and nine attempt to bring down an airliner over detroit
the muslim brotherhood is also a powerful group in yemen in the shape of the al islah party and is well represented in the transitional government
it loathes the houthis and has its own militias
the fighting in yemen also provides an opening to isis which is keen to outflank al qaeda and prove itself the true defender of the faith
in november isis leader abu bakr al baghdadi called on yemeni sunnis to resist the houthis
there are also a number of heavily armed rural tribes that will fight for control over their territories
while in power hadi and the government of prime minister khaled bahah have been trying to fight aqap on the ground and also have authorized u.s. drone strikes in the country against terror targets
as part of those efforts the united states has several hundred american diplomats and military personnel in yemen
but the u.s. embassy has been on reduced staffing since september
the houthis have publicly said they oppose u.s. drone strikes and u.s. involvement in yemen
there are currently no talks with the houthis but there are discussions about whether to talk to them according to u.s. officials
multiple policy options are being considered the officials said though there is no consensus yet about how to proceed
the safety and security of u.s. personnel is our top priority in yemen u.s. state department spokeswoman jen psaki said
we are evaluating the security situation on the ground on an ongoing basis
we call on all parties to abide by their public commitments to ensure the security of the diplomatic community including our personnel
al hamdani the yemen analyst said she didn't see an immediate need to pull u.s. personnel out of yemen
i think yemen is safe at the time being she told cnn's wolf blitzer
the houthis have been in charge for a while
they have popular committees all over the capital of sanaa and they've been running the security show
i do however want to say that the americans might need to start talking to the houthis
and if the americans are talking to iran in back channels they need to do the same with the houthis
since hadi's resignation there has been a lot of anger against the houthis in parts of the country said al rowas the ihs country risk analyst
while hadi wasn't able to unify the country while in power she said since the houthi takeover of sanaa he has become the popular symbol of anti houthi sentiment across southern and central yemen
many there are calling for his return she said
a chief flashpoint for popular anger may be the central marib province she said
there have already been some low level confrontations and tribes are mobilizing in the area
large scale protests have also been seen in aden the main seaport in the country's south where the current chaos plays into the hands of the secession movement
seven things to know about yemen

we started our foundation in two thousand with the idea that by backing innovative work in health and education we could help billions of people improve their lives
the progress we've seen so far is so exciting that we are doubling down on the bet we made fifteen years ago
here's our bet
the lives of people in poor countries will improve faster in the next fifteen years than at any other time in history
we're putting our credibility time and money behind this bet because we think there has never been a better time to accelerate progress and have a big impact around the world
here are four big breakthroughs we see coming by two thousand and thirty
first child deaths will go down by half
in one thousand nine hundred and ninety one in ten children in the world died before age five
today it's one in twenty
by two thousand and thirty it will be one in forty
almost all countries will include vaccines for diarrhea and pneumonia two of the biggest killers of children in their immunization programs
better sanitation will cut the spread of disease dramatically
and we're learning how to help more mothers adopt practices such as proper breastfeeding and skin to skin contact with their babies that prevent newborns from dying in the first month after they're born
second africa will be able to feed itself
today the continent has to rely on imports and food aid to feed its people even though seven out of ten people in sub saharan africa are farmers
part of the problem is that african farmers get just a fraction of the yields that american farmers get
in the next fifteen years however innovations in farming will erase these brutal ironies
with better fertilizer and hardier crops african farmers will be able to grow a greater variety of food and sell their surpluses to supplement their family's diet with vegetables eggs milk and meat
even as climate change makes farmers job more difficult we can get them enough innovation and information to increase productivity by fifty percents for the continent overall
countries like ghana are also building better roads and adopting policies that make it easier to move food to the places where it's most needed
in fifteen years africa will still import food when it makes sense to do so but it will also export much more eventually achieving a net positive trade balance
third mobile banking will help the poor radically transform their lives
today some two point five billion people don't have access to cheap and easy financial services a problem that makes it much more difficult to be poor
if your savings is in the form of jewelry or livestock for example you can't very well chip off tiny pieces to cover routine daily expenses
but in the next fifteen years digital banking will give the poor more control over their assets
the key will be mobile phones
already in developing countries with the right regulatory framework such as bangladesh people are using their phones to store money digitally and make purchases
by two thousand and thirty eight percents of the adults without bank accounts today will be doing the same
and by then mobile money providers will be offering the full range of financial services from interest bearing savings accounts to credit to insurance
fourth as high speed cell networks grow and smartphones become as cheap as today's voice only phones online education will flourish
before a child even starts primary school she will be able to use her mom's smartphone to learn her numbers and letters
software will be able to see when she's having trouble with the material and adjust for her pace
of course software will never replace teachers
but by allowing teachers to do things like upload videos of themselves and get feedback from their peers it can connect them in new ways
what will it take to make sure life really does improve faster for the poor 
we need advances in technology and we need to deliver them to the people who need them most
we also need to close the gender gap
countries where girls don't go to school or women can't open a business will be left behind
another crucial factor will be people who care about helping those in the world's poorest places improve their lives
we're aiming to recruit millions of new advocates we're calling them global citizens to urge world leaders to be ambitious when they meet in september to adopt a new set of goals that will guide the world's efforts to tackle disease poverty and climate change for the next fifteen years
beyond two thousand and fifteen we hope these global citizens will hold governments and other decision makers accountable for meeting those goals
you can show your support by signing up at www.globalcitizen dot org where you can learn how to get engaged and connect with other organizations working to make two thousand and fifteen a historic year
we believe that informed passionate people can work together to make the world a more equitable place
in fact we're betting on it

king salman has taken over as the leader of saudi arabia following the death of his brother king abdullah

the miss universe contest turned out some fabulous eye catching costumes from contestants participating in the show

but diarra raised by immigrants from mali in the paris suburb of viry chatillon says it's as if her neighborhood is stamped across her forehead
it's hard to dream when everyone says the place you come from only spawns jihadists terrorists and delinquents the twenty one year old says
you end up feeling completely isolated
viry chatillon is just one of the many banlieues heavily immigrant working class suburbs dotted around the periphery of the french capital
but its close proximity to grigny has made the neighborhood synonymous with violence and failure
grigny is the hometown of amedy coulibaly who killed a policewoman as well as four hostages at a kosher supermarket in paris two weeks ago
his associates said and cherif kouachi slaughtered twelve more at the office of the satirical magazine charlie hebdo
together they are the worst terror attacks in france in decades
diarra's concerns were exacerbated this week when french prime minister manuel valls declared that there was a geographic social and ethnic apartheid that had developed in france
she believes the use of provocative language only further alienates the people living in the banlieues
diarra says that the past two weeks have attracted a relentless and unwelcome media spotlight on viry chatillon with journalists descending en masse and filming from their cars for fear of being assaulted or having their equipment stolen
the negative press has dredged up many prejudices and cultural stereotypes that diarra has spent most of her young life fighting to dispel ever since the two thousand and five riots that left thousands of cars burnt in the paris region thousands arrested and millions more traumatized across france
yes we need better education and yes delinquency exists in these towns but the government tarnishes us all with the same brush
you stop feeling like an individual and begin to think you're reduced to a crime ridden town diarra says
diarra believes the media perpetuates certain cliches about towns like hers especially the one about how banlieues are full of bad apples
it's a sentiment shared by coulibaly's sister maimouna coulibaly now a successful dancer who reflected on the two thousand and five riots in a two thousand and nine interview with the san francisco chronicle
when you are in the projects they want you to shut your mouth to stay here to grow up complacent
for me the way that people in the projects are portrayed so negatively in the media really hurt me a lot maimouna told the paper
but phillippe rio the mayor of grigny is trying to shatter this image of banlieues as crime wracked ghettos
rio grew up in the concrete maze that is the grande borne the same housing project as coulibaly
rio says it's easy to overlook the success stories of the banlieues in favor of tales of homegrown terrorists but that not everyone from his town is a criminal
grigny was home to a professional football player an actress even a patisserie chef who now works in hong kong he says
these are all very successful people
in the same breath the mayor admits that his town faces grave economic problems
forty percent of grande borne residents aged sixteen twenty five are unemployed
the average net annual income in grigny is nine thousand six hundred euros according to rio the lowest in the paris region
these factors make it very difficult for those who live in the area to feel like they're part of society the mayor says
rio has been waging a campaign to get a fully staffed police station for the town's thirty thousand inhabitants
but the interior ministry has yet to grant his wish
the mayor also believes that better education will help bridge the gap between the banlieues and the state the us and them mentality
eric betencourt a schoolteacher in the eastern parisian suburb of clichy sous bois has a class largely made up of second and third generation immigrant children
a man with a calm demeanor he believes opening a dialogue with his students on the theme of identity in france is crucial to helping his students find their place within the state
his main worry is what happens when they leave school and begin job hunting
because they struggle to find a job they feel disinherited stigmatized and suddenly these young adults can't find their role in the workplace and therefore they create their own communities he says
de charles clauda aka was amedy coulibaly's social worker
his small office in grande borne is littered with photos of smiling children that he has helped guide into adulthood
aka believes one of the reasons coulibaly might have formed a relationship with hardened criminals when he was in jail was because he didn't fit into life outside the prison walls despite desperately wanting to be part of a community
coulibaly had a big problem with identity he was lost
and prison offered him some bad examples to follow aka says
coulibaly's cousin amad agrees
he befriended a bunch of idiots and became himself an idiot amad told french radio rmc
he did not hate jews christians it's the state he hated
connecting the disaffected youth to the state through job creation is what majid el jarroudi has dedicated the last six years to
the business he founded the agency for diversity in entrepreneurship strives to reveal the untapped potential of doing business with undeserved entrepreneurs in marginalized neighborhoods
el jarroudi says the negative publicity surrounding the banlieues means companies shy away from recruiting there and in turn this further antagonizes the people of these towns
we feel like we're alone and when we talk about the banlieues we only talk about its problems and never about the opportunity the banlieues represent today el jarroudi says
that is crucial to bringing everyone together
in the meantime hatouma diarra is hoping opportunity will come knocking as she pursues an internship this summer
her dream is a career in journalism but she knows that ambition alone may not be enough
to have a future you need to believe in yourself but you also need others to believe in you she says


in a much trailed speech in davos at a reception at the world economic forum the resilient royal reiterated and reaffirmed the categorical denials made by buckingham palace issued on his behalf over accusations that he was repeatedly intimate with an alleged underage sex slave
andrew still fifth in line to the british throne and queen elizabeth ii's second son carefully and wisely avoided mentioning the name virginia roberts the woman at the center of the sordid claims
he also did not repeat the specific allegations made against him
for the record those allegations are that miss roberts now thirty one was trafficked to be used as an underage prostitute and was forced to sexually service the prince who she knew as andy by her wealthy boss financier and convicted sex offender jeffrey epstein
she says she was seventeen years old at the time of her first encounter with prince andrew which is under the legal age of consent in florida
she claims in court papers that andrew's scotland yard protection officers left her alone with him the first time he had sex with her and that she was later involved in an orgy with the prince and approximately eight other girls
five photos were also submitted including one which miss roberts said showed her aged fifteen when she says she began working as a sex slave for epstein
she insists she is telling the truth and wants prince andrew to repeat his denials on oath
in his for the record speech prince andrew stressed my focus is on my work
it has prompted some to ask what exactly is it that the duke of york does and what is the point of him 
since his association with convicted sex offender financier epstein forced the duke to accept a downgrading of his role as a uk trade envoy in two thousand and eleven he has been busy trying to carve out a new role for himself
he has continued to support business in the uk but without a specialized role as before
in recent months many high ranking figures at buckingham palace believed was on the right track and making progress in achieving that new role
i have witnessed personally what a good no nonsense communicator andrew is at events he has inspired and hosted
he is particularly passionate when dealing with young start up entrepreneurs and bringing them together with successful businesses at networking and showcasing events
andrew is direct and to the point and his methods seem to work
there is no doubt he is passionate about these issues and before this sex scandal blew up in his face he was making a good fist of it
as he said in his davos speech but went widely unreported as his sound bite about the sex allegations took all the attention
i focus on inspiring young people to develop skills to enable them to become economically active and encouraging a culture of enterprise and entrepreneurship
two of the important initiatives he has inspired are the digital enterprise awards referred to as idea which he is working with the nominet trust to deliver
this is about to engage and to inspire young people to get not only digital skills but enterprise skills and to expand their knowledge in the digital universe
so far in year one about ten thousand young people are engaged in the program
his second big project is pitch palace a bid to support start up businesses
in two thousand and fourteen the duke launched pitch palace and held two competitive pitch events at st james's palace worked with seventy six entrepreneurs from across the uk
each event was attended by around four hundred invited investors mentors and supporters
on the day pitchatpalace was trending four th in the uk on twitter
since then more than seven hundred connections made between the entrepreneurs and the audience
some results for the entrepreneurs featured include
financial wellbeing startup squirrel which has raised five hundred k hired four new employees and received media coverage on cnn and other major media outlets
andrew argues passionately that entrepreneurs need more than just money
they need business partners they need mentorship they need customers and they need network and of course investors
essentially his new role is all about assisting the economic success of and the creation of skilled jobs in the uk
his efforts focus on three core areas where he believes he can have the greatest impact
education and skills promoting apprenticeships as a desirable path to a career is one of his big issues
he is patron of the studio schools trust and the baker dearing educational trust among others
last year he visited nine university technical colleges and studio schools as well as twenty four other educational projects or institutions interacting with in excess of five thousand students and learners
entrepreneurship is his second core focus encouraging entrepreneurship in the uk supporting current start ups and efforts to develop a culture of enterprise
thirdly supporting science technology and engineering promoting expertise in these areas which attract investment into uk and promoting the further translation of science into business
he has also been key in showcasing the work of the uk technology industry and innovators
last month he hosted the duke of york award for technical education at st james's palace to celebrate the achievements of students in university technical colleges across the united kingdom
there is no doubt this work is all highly commendable
but it is not his work life that is under scrutiny but his judgment
but if prince andrew hopes his unprecedented move to speak out publicly about his private life will draw a line under the scandal he is mistaken
why 
because there are still simply too many unanswered questions about his role in the scandal engulfing him
not least what was the nature of his relationship with epstein a man convicted of procuring underage woman for prostitution why did he visit him after he was released from prison and what was the nature of his association with virginia roberts who he was photographed with when she says she was a teenager
this combined with the fact the ongoing civil court case in the u.s. against epstein and three women could just keep turning up new embarrassing allegations about the duke
however it is important to remember the prince is not facing legal proceedings over the u.s. claims
he has simply been named in court papers
he has not done anything illegal until someone proves he has
to date he has not been charged with anything either
it may be wiser for the media to show a measure of fairness and restraint when reporting allegations that are no matter how salacious and good copy after all just that allegations
the only way perhaps andrew can hope to move on is by giving a detailed rebuttal of all the allegations that have been made against him in a sworn affidavit


the doomsday clock is a universally recognized indicator of the world's vulnerability to catastrophe from nuclear weapons climate change and other emerging global threats
although it may be easier to think out of sight out of mind the bulletin has been alerting us since one thousand nine hundred and forty seven that nuclear weapons remain a grave threat to the survival of humanity
the original setting was seven minutes to midnight and now we've allowed our world to drift to a setting of three minutes to midnight not seen since one thousand nine hundred and eighty four during one of the most dangerous periods of the cold war
there are still sixteen thousand three hundred nuclear weapons in the world many on high alert able to be launched in less than fifteen minutes
there can be no meaningful medical or humanitarian response to a nuclear attack whether it is planned or accidental
cheating scandals low morale and security lapses that put us all at risk have plagued america's nuclear military forces
according to eric schlosser author of command and control there were more than one thousand mishaps involving our nuclear arsenal from one thousand nine hundred and fifty one thousand nine hundred and sixty eight
and who knows what hair raising incidents have happened involving foreign arsenals 
our nuclear security ought not to depend on good luck continuing indefinitely
the setting of the doomsday clock also addresses the vast scale of the danger
recent research published by physicians for social responsibility indicates that even a limited regional nuclear war say between india and pakistan would have profound health impacts on all of us
if one hundred hiroshima size weapons were used in such a war the climatic effects would have a devastating impact on world agriculture and put two billion people at risk of starving
it has become self evident that these weapons have no military utility and are too dangerous to keep around
we can change this
recently a dynamic worldwide movement of people and governments has shown a renewed interest in nuclear disarmament
in october one hundred and fifty five of the world's governments representing seventy nine percents of the nations of the world supported a u.n. resolution calling for the elimination of nuclear weapons
in a powerful personal message last month to the vienna conference on the humanitarian impact of nuclear weapons pope francis declared that nuclear weapons are a global problem affecting all nations and impacting future generations and the planet that is our home
a global ethic is needed if we are to reduce the nuclear threat and work towards nuclear disarmament
he went on to say i am convinced that the desire for peace and fraternity planted deep in the human heart will bear fruit in concrete ways to ensure that nuclear weapons are banned once and for all to the benefit of our common home
president barack obama promised to pursue a world free of nuclear weapons but his administration must not have gotten the memo
the current plan involves spending three hundred and fifty five billion dollar over the next ten years to maintain and modernize our nuclear arsenal and one dollar trillion over the next thirty years
this is an absurd waste of taxpayers dollars on weapons that must never be used
the time has come for the united states in words and deeds to support the global elimination of nuclear weapons
the resetting of the clock was also influenced by the report that last year was the warmest ever recorded on earth
this underscores scientific warnings that the relentless warming of our planet poses profound long term risks to civilization and to the natural world
unless we change our behavior worsening climate change will continue to negatively affect public health from heat related disorders worsening respiratory problems such as allergies and asthma more infectious diseases crop failure from drought or flooding with resulting malnutrition to mental health disorders such as post traumatic stress disorder and depression
our political leaders have a moral obligation to our children grandchildren and future generations to leave them a planet free of nuclear weapons and a planet that is not damaged beyond repair by the ravages of climate change

since we're attacking there is no sense to have peace talks now aleksandr zakharchenko leader of the self proclaimed people's republic of donetsk said in a meeting with university students according to his media office
we've made this mistake before
it's not decent to repeat it he said
thousands have been killed in months of conflict between the rebels and ukrainian troops and a ceasefire agreed to in september crumbled long ago
zakharchenko's comments came two days after the foreign ministers of ukraine and russia met in berlin to discuss a way out of the violence
but zakharchenko showed no interest in the talks
there will be no attempts from our side to talk about the ceasefire he said reported russian state news agency ria
we will be on the offensive until we reach the border of donetsk region
he said that he was interested in cooperating with ukraine on prisoner exchanges
we need to get our guys who've been captured he said according to ria
despite the talks in berlin violence in the breakaway donetsk and luhansk regions in eastern ukraine shows no signs of abating
power is out in and around luhansk after militants shelled a power plant there luhansk regional official hennady moskal told ukraine's state run ukrinform news agency
moskal noted that the local water supply and boilers are off and trolley buses aren't operating
thursday's shelling of a transit stop in donetsk city an attack that ukraine's defense ministry blamed on rebels killed eight civilians according to state news reports
but ukrainian troops have come under heavy fire as well
that includes one hundred and fifteen attacks in a recent twenty four hour period that killed three troops and wounded fifty more ukrinform reported friday
the news agency said that russian terrorist troops faced off with ukrainian soldiers thursday along bakhumtka highway even posting a picture that showed a man with stripes on his clothing suggesting that he was part of the russian military
this is in line with kiev's repeated assertions that russia has not only actively supported rebels with arms but has sent its own troops across the border to battle ukrainian forces
on wednesday for instance ukrainian president petro poroshenko said that more than nine thousand russian troops our russian ukrainian border bring with them hundreds and hundreds of tanks armed personnel carriers and killing ukrainian civilians and attacking ukrainian troops
russian foreign minister sergey lavrov promptly responded to this assertion with a firm denial much like other denials made by russian officials in recent months over similar allegations of armed intervention
as to the flow of troops and armaments this is not the first time we hear something like that he said
and each time i hear that i say if you're so confident about that please present us with facts but no one has been able to provide us with these facts
pro russian separatists have claimed control of parts of eastern ukraine since the spring of two thousand and fourteen despite a push by ukrainian forces to defeat them
from mid april to january twenty one the conflict had killed at least five thousand and eighty six people and injured at least ten thousand nine hundred and forty eight others said the united nations
we fear that the real figure may be considerably higher the office of the u.n. high commissioner for human rights said about the death toll in a report released friday
at least two hundred and sixty two people were killed in the fighting from january thirteen through wednesday alone the report said
unrest in ukraine began with protests in the country's capital last year after president viktor yanukovych favoring closer ties to russia dropped plans to sign a political and economic agreement with the european union
after months of protests and days of deadly clashes between demonstrators and security personnel in kiev parliament ousted yanukovych in february
weeks later russia annexed the crimean peninsula
then in april violence broke out in two ukrainian regions that border russia donetsk and luhansk as separatist leaders declared independence from the government in kiev

using the resting metropolis as a backdrop sola draws swift shapes in the air with the light wand
thirty seconds later the camera shutter clicks and the light artist grabs his kit disappearing once more into the night
welcome to the elusive magical world of lightbombing
sola is the street artist alter ego of forty year old photographer peter medlicott who has been capturing the urban landscape of birmingham streets since shortly after relocating there in two thousand
much of the city had become ex industrial space and sola recalls how upon first appearances the city seemed somewhat run down
but a chance late night shoot revealed the transformative nature of nightfall on the city
what were once dead spaces became a textural stage for the photographer to illuminate
meeting in the heart of the city's creative quarter sola greets me warmly before grabbing a coffee and sitting down
dressed casually in a sweatshirt jeans and sneakers his face lights up with enthusiasm as he begins to explain the art of lightbombing
lightbombing is long exposure photography where the artist draws intricate designs patterns or words using hand held lights in front of a camera in pitch black darkness
while many artists around the world experiment with long exposure photography and light art sola coined the term lightbombing
it's me the drunks and the burglars he says grinning
to the average casual observer who just happens to come across me i look like a complete nutter
i'm in the street waving a torch around
it's so dark you can't see my camera ninety percents of the time
and you're looking at this dude running around thinking what the hell is going on 
his technique borrows elements from graffiti including bombing where the artist gets to a location does the work and is gone
sola's physical process lasts mere seconds and leaves a continuous fluctuating stroke on the final photograph as if by magic
it's like drawing on the page and when i move the light in front of a camera it leaves that mark
if you go faster it leaves a thinner mark and if you go slower it leaves a brighter mark explains the artist
then for just a brief moment sola's face becomes solemn
although striking and entertaining to see lightbombing isn't some frivolous hobby
explaining his vocation sola's voice is filled with passion for his work as he reiterates that what you see is what he shoots
he's adamant that the camera should capture the moment and only permits himself to edit the photographs in as much as a darkroom would allow
i never edit my photos
you should shoot it for real he says
when i grew up with film you had to make it in the camera
there was no messing around
you couldn't do much afterwards in post edit
yet some of the most iconic imagery of all time was shot on film and very little touches with a brush afterwards on the print
i think there is something important about that
he adds
i very purposefully don't shoot under direct light
i don't hang around
i don't wear bright clothing
i wish i wore some crazy ninja zentai suit or something
i'm not going to get arrested
often he will spend weeks scouting the perfect location for his latest collection
and while he's always eager to find a new space he says he has no desire to be arrested
as long as i don't break anything to get in i'm not forcing entry
if there is a fence down there's a fence down
i'm just wandering around
by and large it is never my intention to trespass
i'm walking around and if there is a way into a space i might use it
the popularity of sola's light art has offered the photographer some exciting opportunities in the last few years including working with commercial partners such as nike for ad campaigns and traveling to dubai for a three week collaboration with local artists
he has also shot scenes in the british countryside and during the glastonbury annual music festival
using the city as his playground he never returns to the same location twice explaining that he thinks it helps keep his work fresh
but just for once tonight he has driven me to an abandoned car park he recently shot at
as he expertly unfurls his tripod and snaps his camera in to place sola claims anyone can duplicate his method all you need is a light source and a camera
the first few i did were with road safety maintenance lights that you have in your car
you can use anything you could use your phone
you can use anything that has got a light
i use certain items i'm not a painter but they are my brushes and also my sculptor's tools as well
different ones do different things
different filters go onto them and to help me realize what i need that light form to do
after a few test shots to check the light and angles of the moonlit rooftop he turns on a meter long light bar with what looks like purple transparency paper taped to one side and begins moving in front of the camera
i'm working out which strokes to make and where to put them in order to achieve what i want to do
so again there's little nuances
the perspectives of what you expect it to be are out he says
by using angles and basically taking maximum advantage of the camera and tools at hand to shift the perspectives i think that's when you start to take it away from being real
it takes into a sort of wonderful mystical element
and how long does it take for sola to create these dazzling light sculptures 
rather nonchalantly he replies
about six minutes
in out shoot
get back in the car
as he comes back to the camera to check each shot sola describes how it is quite meditative to work late into the night and how he often falls into a zen like state while designing his pieces
but while he waxes lyrical about the metamorphic beauty of a deserted city he's also quick to remind me of the ever present danger
you're on your own from a safety perspective and it is an expensive camera bag that i'd quite like to keep hold of
it can lead to some hairy moments
i'm pretty much fast enough to get gone
i try to shoot wherever possible near to my car
most of the time when anyone even vaguely sketchy gets close enough you show them what you're doing and they are so blown away by it that you diffuse the situation
while he is open to sharing his techniques with the world this masterful manipulator of light rarely features himself in his work preferring to let the photographs speak for themselves
i just want to inspire people with my work
if someone can look at a piece and be excited inspired moved in any way shape or form then i'm happy job done
because there is not enough of that in life
and there's too much art 
this is why i strip away the arty stuff
it's there and i could sit and wax about it but no one wants to hear that really
everyone can get something different from it
it keeps it accessible to people
despite the near freezing temperatures out on city streets tonight hours fly by as we move from location to location
finally after one last shot sola makes his way back to the camera glances at the screen and concludes he's ready to call it a night
as he flips his tripod and pushes the legs back into the locked position i ask him where he wants to take the moving art form next
a lot of my work is very abstract he says
a lot of my work has that magical element that wondrous thing but sometimes there is not enough tangibility to it
the nike campaign was a starting point
but i'd like to up the game essentially high end fashion
do beautiful work with more people in them
i love the abstract work but for my heart need to shoot with people

on tuesday isis released a video threatening to kill the two men kenji goto and haruna yukawa unless japan paid the group two hundred million dollar within seventy two hours
based on the time frame the japanese government estimated that the ultimatum expired at two fifty p.m. friday tokyo time and scrambled to secure the men's release
hours before the estimated deadline an isis spokesman told japanese broadcaster nhk that the group would release a statement soon about the hostages
that statement didn't come
when asked whether isis has been in negotiations with the japanese government the spokesman told nhk he wouldn't comment
isis claims the ransom amount is the same as the financial aid pledged by japanese prime minister shinzo abe to countries affected by the militant group
japanese officials have repeatedly stressed that their military which is constitutionally forbidden from taking action other than for self defense isn't involved in the international airstrikes against isis positions in syria and iraq
the abe pledge is for humanitarian purposes like helping refugees not military purposes japan says
in his communication with nhk the isis spokesman said the group is aware of what japan says and then he went on to call the japanese infidels for fighting with the group
it says it's doing its best to communicate with isis
it wants to secure the hostages safe release but it won't yield to threats
japanese chief cabinet secretary yoshihide suga said he was aware of reports that isis would soon make a statement
we are receiving many different pieces of information but as a government we can not really comment as to whether that information is authentic he said
caught in the middle are the two men goto and yukawa
as the apparent deadline approached goto's mother begged for her son's life
to all members of isis kenji is not the enemy of isis
please release him said the mother junko ishido
there is so little time left before the deadline
i have been just crying for the last three days filled with sadness
words fail to describe how i feel
kenji always has been a kind person ever since he was little
he was always saying i want to save the lives of children in war zones 
leading japanese news organizations have reported citing unidentified government sources that goto's wife got an email in december from someone demanding eight million dollar to sixteen million dollar for her husband's return
the government is trying to confirm if that email came from isis the reports said
if so it could indicate the militant group is willing to accept a smaller ransom than the two hundred million dollar it had publicly demanded
but the question is what if anything japan is willing to give
isis has a ruthless track record
it has released videos touting the killing of five western hostages since august
abe has called isis ultimatum over the two japanese men's lives unacceptable and said the international community shouldn't give in to terrorists
but he and other government officials haven't explicitly ruled out paying a ransom
some details have emerged about what spurred the two japanese citizens to travel thousands of miles to the bloody syrian conflict
while they had different professions the two men knew and talked to each other said yukawa's friend nobuo kimoto
goto an experienced freelance journalist made a video in october near the turkish syrian border before he embarked on a perilous journey into isis controlled territory
it is my responsibility if something happens he explained
goto forty seven said he was determined to cover what was happening in the region
syrian people suffering three years and a half
it's enough he said
so i would like to get the story of what isis wants to do
alaaeddin al zaim who had worked with goto in syria previously says he warned him not to enter the isis stronghold of raqqa
i tell him it's not safe for you al zaim told cnn
but goto chose to go anyway saying i am not american i am not british
i'm japanese
i can go al zaim recalled
the aims and activities in syria of yukawa a forty two year old unemployed widower are murkier
he originally headed to the war ravaged country early last year with the aim of gaining combat and survival experience to bolster his plans to set up a private security company said his friend kimoto
there yukawa met goto who gave him insights on how to survive there kimoto said
he also introduced him to rebel fighters who are distinct from isis even though both are fighting against syrian president bashar al assad's forces
some of the rebels talked about their need for ambulances to shuttle the wounded
that plea spurred yukawa to start raising money for this cause after returning to japan according to kimoto
i felt a chill when he said after returning home he felt in syria he was really living a life kimoto said
he seems to have felt satisfaction being there and living together with the locals
yukawa went back to syria in july a trip that kimoto said he didn't know about at the time
kimoto said he had advised his friend to focus on building up his private security company

why countries should think about paying ransoms

their photos and personal details have been splashed across a giant electronic screen outside a major train station in changsha city in china's southern province hunan
curious onlookers and commuters gathered outside the bustling train station as a series of individual headshots identity numbers their offenses and amounts of outstanding court fines rolled across a massive electronic billboard one after the other as shown on chinese state television
instead of flashing ads it serves as a public wall of shame for those that failed to pay court ordered fines for violating property disclosure laws disobeying court orders or failing to respond to subpoenas
the amount of outstanding fines range from ten thousand yuan up to twenty nine million yuan
wang lifu a court official told hunan city's largest newspaper xiaoxiang morning post on wednesday that it was part of a campaign in the new year to beef up policy implementation measures
wang added that it was doing a public service by exposing the details
according to chinese supreme court regulations it is legal for local courts to publish private information of people or organizations who have disobeyed court orders
the advertising agency that manages the billboard confirmed with cnn that the court has authorized them to publish personal details of the individuals and companies for two weeks until they pay off their debts
as of today we have taken down information of one company and two individuals because they have settled their debts with the courts said chen kai general manager of changsha gaoxun advertising company
he added that they did not charge the courts for any advertising fees in support of the court's decision to force debtors to pay
for now the public also seems to support the court's pressurizing tactics
now those people who are dishonest have nowhere to hide and dare not do it again zhou ya a man standing outside the railway station told hunan tv a local channel
the court has played hardball by exposing these cheaters well done

it involves an investigation into the deadliest terror attack in argentina's history modern geopolitics alleged betrayals a puzzling death and a dose of paranoia
if you are unfamiliar with the story
last week a special prosecutor investigating the one thousand nine hundred and ninety four bombing of a jewish community center in buenos aires filed a report alleging that the president foreign minister and other officials conspired to cover up iran's involvement in the attack which killed eighty five
the prosecutor alberto nisman was invited to testify about his allegations before congress on monday
but on the eve of his testimony nisman was found dead inside his apartment
he died of a gunshot wound to the temple
a gun and a shell casing were found near his body
the apartment was locked from the inside
at first glance a suicide
but the untimely death raised suspicions immediately
a poll by the firm ipsos of more than four hundred argentineans found that seventy percents of them believed that nisman was murdered
some eighteen percents believed he took his own life and twelve percents didn't have an opinion
in a statement she called it the suicide was not a suicide
it is an about face from her position just days before
her first statement on nisman's death was a rejection of the prosecutor's allegations and a reflection on what was it that led a person to make the terrible decision to take his own life 
two things happened after that
the prosecutor looking into nisman's death said that no gunpowder residue was found on his hands as would be likely if he pulled the trigger
second the locksmith who helped nisman's mother gain access into the apartment cast doubt on reports that the door could have been opened only from inside
to the contrary someone could have gained entry with something as simple as a wire the locksmith said
anybody could have opened it he told a swarm of reporters after giving a statement to investigators
while fernandez now considers that nisman did not commit suicide she still believes that his allegations against her government are false
nisman was not a hack with an agenda against the president but a naive investigator who was used by others who fed him false information fernandez said
the criminal complaint by prosecutor nisman was never in itself the true plot against the government fernandez wrote
his report collapses like a house of cards she wrote and nisman probably never knew he was being fed false information
the real plot against the government was his death which came after he accused her government of a cover up to protect iranian suspects in the bombing fernandez wrote
they used him while he was alive and then they needed him dead she wrote
it's that sad and terrible
nisman's report promised to provide evidence of the existence of a sophisticated criminal plot deliberately conjured to cover up and provide impunity to the iranians accused in the investigation of the attack of the jewish community center in one thousand nine hundred and ninety four
less than forty eight hours after nisman's body was found the court that had received the criminal complaint published the entire document on the internet
traffic was so heavy that the website hosting the document crashed for a while
the two hundred and eighty nine page report makes its case based on tapped telephone conversations between representatives of argentina and iran and concludes that the south american nation agreed to stop pursuing the named iranian suspects in the bombing in exchange for an oil for grain and meat deal with iran
a little background
in two thousand and seven argentina requested the arrest of several iranians in connection with the one thousand nine hundred and ninety four bombing including former defense minister ahmad vahidi
interpol approved so called red notices for these suspects alerting countries around the world of buenos aires desire to have them arrested
according to nisman's report representatives on fernandez's behalf held both secret and public meetings where it was agreed that the trade deal could be reached if the red notices were withdrawn
it was a geopolitical move to fortify argentina's economic position at the cost of forgoing justice in the bombing of the argentine israelite mutual association building according to nisman
intercepted phone calls between representatives of both countries show that there was a conspiracy to create a new hypothesis for the bombing and to redirect the investigation based on fake evidence that would remove the spotlight from the iranians nisman's report states
the public face of this plan was an agreement reached between both countries in two thousand and thirteen to jointly investigate the bombing by creating a binational truth commission nisman wrote
the plan never took off however because of an unexpected roadblock according to nisman's report
interpol refused to withdraw the red notices against the iranians
without that iran moved the deal to the back burner nisman wrote
the release of nisman's report was not a bombshell
its contents were widely reported but fernandez's government and its supporters outright rejected the allegations
fernandez focused her attack on nisman's sources including two argentineans that the prosecutor identified as working for the country's intelligence services
these alleged spies ramon allan hector bogado and hector yrimia never worked for argentine intelligence fernandez said
everything nisman argues is false fernandez says the spies were spies argentina didn't ask interpol to withdraw the red notices trade between argentina and iran has actually decreased and so on
we think all the allegations are baseless foreign minister hector timerman told cnn on thursday
fernandez's government has done more than any previous administration to get to the bottom of the bombing timerman said
i am jewish he said
and to think that a person of my religion the jewish religion can make a deal not to prosecute the death of eighty five people most of them jewish in argentina
i have to tell you it's not easy to live with
the argentine government was not involved in nisman's death in any way he said
nobody i mean wanted more for mr. nisman to live and to answer questions than the president of argentina and myself timerman said
if the accusations and counter accusations laid out by all sides aren't confusing enough additional theories continue to arise
in a news conference argentina's chief of the cabinet ministers anibal fernandez offered new questions
nisman was on vacation in europe with his teenage daughter when he suddenly cut short his trip and returned to argentina according to the cabinet chief
things just get stranger he said asking who called him back in a hurry
why did he return 
why did he leave his daughter there alone at an international airport 
the cabinet chief said
it was previously reported in the local media that nisman told a reporter at least twice that this investigation might cost him his life
he also allegedly got the handgun from a friend because he feared for his security according to reports
the cabinet chief proposed another wrinkle
the closer we read the more we are convinced that nisman didn't even write that complaint
what is the reason behind filing this 
what is the objective 
this is what we must find out
the whole story is a tangled web that is hard to describe but reflects an observation argentine novelist jorge luis borges once made
reality is not always probable or likely

the conservator who spoke on condition of anonymity told egypt's state owned ahram online that the mask's beard broke off by accident when the mask fell as it was being cleaned last year at the egyptian museum in cairo
he said the blue and gold braided beard was fixed back in place quickly with epoxy a type of strong adhesive
the epoxy was not a proper material to use to restore the mask although it is a conservation material with a very high strength for attaching metal and stone he is quoted as saying
the conservator said there was now a gap between the face and the beard where the glue had dried
however the egyptian museum's general director mahmoud el halwagi dismissed the claims in an interview with ahram online saying the beard was in its original position and that nothing had happened to the mask since he took up his position in october
an archaeological committee was assigned to inspect the mask and beard in order to write a detailed report on the mask's condition he said
minister of antiquities mamdouh eldamaty also told ahram online that media reports of damage to the mask were unfounded
the boy king's elaborate burial mask discovered in his tomb in one thousand nine hundred and twenty two is one of egypt's most outstanding artifacts
tutankhamun who ruled from one thousand three hundred and thirty six one thousand three hundred and twenty seven bc is thought to have been about seventeen years old when he died based on analysis of his mummy according to the british museum
his cause of death is not known
if confirmed it won't be the first time a historical treasure was damaged in an institution supposed to keep it safe
in two thousand and six a visitor to the fitzwilliam museum in cambridge england famously tripped on a staircase and smashed three hugely valuable chinese qing dynasty vases
the thousands of porcelain fragments were eventually painstakingly reassembled

that's the message from the bulletin of atomic scientists which moved its iconic doomsday clock up two minutes on thursday
the clock now stands at three minutes to midnight the latest it's been since one thousand nine hundred and eighty four when the cold war between the u.s. and soviet union was a major issue
today unchecked climate change and a nuclear arms race resulting from modernization of huge arsenals pose extraordinary and undeniable threats to the continued existence of humanity
and world leaders have failed to act with the speed or on the scale required to protect citizens from potential catastrophe said kennette benedict executive director of the bulletin of the atomic scientists in a news release
these failures of leadership endanger every person on earth
the bulletin's science and security board looks at global issues on a regular basis and decides whether to move the minute hand of the clock with particular stress on the status of nuclear arms and reaction to climate issues
in recent years the clock has moved the wrong direction for humanity
after standing at seventeen minutes to midnight in one thousand nine hundred and ninety one the furthest it's ever been from the end of the world it's gotten closer each time it's been changed since with the exception of two thousand and ten when it was pushed back by one minute to eleven fifty four p.m
the last time the clock was moved was in two thousand and twelve when it was moved up one minute to eleven fifty five
the scientists expressed disappointment at the latest developments
noting that nuclear trends are moving backwards the science and security board's sharon squassoni pointed out that weapons modernization programs and disarmament have ground to a halt
and action on climate change 
efforts at reducing global emissions of heat trapping gases have so far been entirely insufficient to prevent unacceptable climate disruption said the bulletin's richard somerville
we all need to respond now while there is still time
the doomsday clock was first put out in one thousand nine hundred and forty seven
the closest the clock has been to midnight was in one thousand nine hundred and fifty three when it was set at eleven fifty eight p.m

though the vote was largely symbolic as she had already lost her post it also carries a five year ban from politics
the news came hours after the attorney general's office announced that yingluck who was removed from office in may last year days before the military swept to power in a coup will face criminal charges over the affair
if found guilty she could face up to ten years in prison
the rice subsidy program introduced in two thousand and eleven pledged to pay farmers well above the market rate for their crop
but critics said it wasted large amounts of public funds trying to please rural voters hurting exports and leaving the government with large stockpiles of rice it couldn't sell without losing money
she was eventually put under investigation by thailand's national anti corruption commission
in an address to the nla thursday yingluck denied any wrongdoing and questioned whether the impeachment vote was valid
the nacc's legitimacy in sending the impeachment case for the nla's consideration is questionable since the constitution of two thousand and seven has been revoked
with the coup d'etat on may twenty two two thousand and fourteen she said
i am no longer prime minister since the constitutional court has already removed me thus there is essentially no position to impeach me from
the legal grounds claimed by the nacc were also invalid as the target of impeaching me is to ban me from holding any political positions for five years which is a clear violation of my fundamental rights and liberties
but the bangkok post reported friday that many nla members were unconvinced and found she was unable to clear up the accusations against her
they also backed the nacc evidence against her
in a statement translated into english by her office yingluck said she would continue to fight to prove my innocence to the very end no matter what the outcome will be
she said the rice subsidy scheme was beneficial for the farmers and the country and that claims it lost money were wrong and motivated by political bias against her
i am not sad because i am the victim of this entire ordeal but i am sad for the rice farmers and all of the disadvantaged thai citizens whose lives will return to the vicious cycle of being poor debt ridden and being taken advantage of and most important of all being denied of their basic democratic rights under the rule of law she said
two weeks before the military coup last may a thai court ordered yingluck's removal finding her guilty of violating the country's constitution in her reassignment of a senior security official in two thousand and eleven
that official was replaced by the then national police chief whose role in turn was given to priewpan damapong
damapong is the brother of the ex wife of thaksin shinawatra yingluck's brother who was overthrown as prime minister in a military coup in two thousand and six
thaksin is living in self imposed exile to avoid a corruption conviction

another vaccine from merck and newlink will also be tested
shipping the vaccine today is a major achievement and shows that we remain on track with the accelerated development of our candidate ebola vaccine dr. moncef slaoui chairman of global vaccines at gsk said in a company release
ebola who is patient zero 
in december the trial of the vaccine made by merck and newlink were stopped after some of the volunteers in the trial had transient mild joint pain
after investigating that side effect scientists concluded it was not a big enough issue to stop the development of the vaccine
no similar side effects were noted in the gsk trial
there are other ebola vaccines being tested by companies in the united states and in russia
this first shipment will be used along with a placebo in this first large scale trial in the next few weeks in liberia
we are expecting to start by the last week in january but there are some details that need to be ironed out regarding the fda said dr. anthony fauci the director of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases at a press conference
worst ebola outbreak in history
what you should know
the tests should begin in the monrovia area and will involve nearly thirty thousand people
people who have had the virus and survived will be excluded from this trial according to gsk
the first people to get the vaccine will be health care workers who are some of the population that is most at risk for catching ebola
that's because it can be easily transmitted through exposure to bodily fluids
in liberia there have been three hundred and seventy cases of health care workers becoming infected with ebola one hundred and seventy eight of them have died according to the world health organization
the number of newly infected health care workers has declined recently as has the number of cases in general in liberia
in august and september of two thousand and fourteen the who was seeing three hundred new confirmed cases per week versus the eight new confirmed cases according to this latest incident report
another trial in sierra leone should start a few weeks after the trials get started in liberia according to the nih
sierra leone has had the largest number of infections of any country with ten thousand three hundred and forty reported cases and three thousand one hundred and forty five deaths from ebola
the disease has slowed down according to the who but still there were one hundred and seventeen new confirmed cases according to the latest report
the centers for disease control and prevention will work with sierra leone's government to help manage the tests
the nih will also soon be testing the therapeutic drug zmapp as early as next month
zmapp is an experimental drug that has been used to help patients who have already been infected by the virus
the drug maker mapp biopharmaceutical ran out of the drug last year but has been making enough doses for a small human trial
the number of new ebola cases in liberia has been declining but public health leaders say that there are still little mini outbreaks and that until there is a very last case is not over until it is over fauci said
since the outbreak began in december two thousand and thirteen there have been twenty one thousand seven hundred and fifty nine infections and eight thousand six hundred and sixty eight people have died from ebola


the man taking control of the world's top oil exporter is well established in the gulf kingdom's corridors of power
salman seventy nine is a stalwart of the royal family who is viewed as a pragmatic and cautious reformer much like his predecessor says cnn's becky anderson in abu dhabi
he has served as defense minister and deputy prime minister of saudi arabia a vital u.s. ally in the middle east for years
like abdullah he's one of the dozens of sons of saudi arabia's founder king abdulaziz
here are some of the key points about the new ruler
salman was governor of the saudi capital riyadh for nearly five decades during a period of significant change
when he became governor in one thousand nine hundred and sixty three riyadh had two hundred thousand inhabitants today it has more than seven million bruce riedel a senior fellow at the brookings institution's center for middle east policy said in a commentary
salman presided over this remarkable transformation with a record for good governance and a lack of corruption
he had to be a combination
of a reformer of a judge a jury in some cases and deal with dissent as well as dealing with economic issues robert jordan a former u.s. ambassador to saudi arabia told cnn
so i think he's well prepared for the task at hand
salman's experience running riyadh also involved keeping many of the numerous members of the saudi royal family in line
since most of the royal princes and princesses live in riyadh he was also the family sheriff ensuring any transgressions were dealt with smoothly and quietly with no publicity said riedel who worked for the cia for thirty years
his national roles have since brought him wider responsibility
salman has been chairing cabinet meetings for several months and handling almost all foreign travel responsibilities for the monarchy since he became the heir in two thousand and twelve riedel said
salman's ascension to the throne is in line with the appointments put in place by abdullah before his death
i think that you'll see a continuation very similar policies very similar dynamics unfolding said james zogby president of the arab american institute
the kingdom is modernizing
it's changing it's reforming and it will continue to do so over the next several decades
riedel says the royal family values family collegiality and harmony highly
the two previous saudi kingdoms in the eighteen th and nineteen th centuries were wracked by internal family squabbles which their foreign enemies exploited he explains
with the arab world facing its worst crisis in decades the royals will want to present an image of stability and strength
salman is one of abdullah's younger brothers
but at seventy nine he's not particularly young
there are unconfirmed reports that he may have various health problems
but with saudi arabian media tightly controlled by the state nobody's really sure what his condition is
riedel says salman has had a stroke simon henderson of the washington institute says the new king's brain is ravaged by dementia and the economist reports he's believed to be suffering from alzheimer's 
reports do differ sharply over just how ill prince salman really is and medical reports on the illnesses of the saudi royal family can be grossly inaccurate cautioned anthony h. cordesman a middle east expert at the center for strategic and international studies
salman's schedule of official meetings suggests a degree of health
but henderson isn't convinced it proves he's highly capable
the fact that salman appears in public at all is attributed to his determination to become king or more likely the ambition of his closest relatives that he should do so he wrote last month
salman's first order after assuming the throne was to appoint his youngest brother prince muqrin as the new crown prince
analysts see that appointment as an effort to ensure future stability
abdullah had named muqrin as deputy crown prince in march
at sixty nine years old muqrin is relatively youthful
a former head of intelligence for the kingdom he is also reportedly well liked by world leaders
muqrin has been closely linked to abdullah and his policies of modernization and reform according to cordesman
but the succession plan isn't without its critics
muqrin's mother does not have royal blood which is a sticking point for some people in saudi arabia
several of salman's sons also hold prominent positions
they include prince sultan who in the one thousand nine hundred and eighty s became the first muslim astronaut and is now the president of saudi arabia's tourism authority
prince abdulaziz the deputy oil minister
and prince faisal the governor of the medina region
another son prince khaled was reportedly among the pilots who carried out the first airstrikes on isis positions in syria last year
details about salman's earlier life and upbringing weren't immediately available friday
but an official biography contained one nugget about his youth
he had apparently memorized the quran by the age of ten it said

abdullah died early friday several weeks after the state run saudi press agency said he was suffering from pneumonia and had been admitted to a hospital
the royal court didn't release an exact cause of death
he was ninety
to ensure a smooth transition the kingdom quickly appointed his seventy nine year old half brother salman bin abdulaziz to the throne
his half brother prince muqrin a decade younger is the new crown prince
after friday afternoon prayers at riyadh's imam turki bin abdullah grand mosque the body of abdullah wrapped in a pale shroud was carried from the mosque toward a cemetery followed by a solemn procession of saudi men in traditional dress
he was later laid to rest after a simple swift ceremony
those present at the graveside the royals closest to the late king were then to move on to a royal palace where they were to pay their respects to the new monarch
the ceremony of al bayaah or pledging of allegiance to the new king followed the funeral
condolences and remembrances poured in from all corners of the globe
to god we belong and indeed to him we shall return said the homepage of the english language saudi newspaper arab news
bahrain jordan and the palestinian territories among others declared days of mourning
the u.n. secretary general praised abdullah for his arab peace initiative to end the arab israeli conflict
u.s. vice president joe biden said he would lead a delegation in the coming days to pay respects
king abdullah's life spanned from before the birth of modern saudi arabia through its emergence as a critical force within the global economy and a leader among arab and islamic nations u.s. president barack obama said in a statement
speaking to cnn's richard quest in davos switzerland u.s. secretary of state john kerry said he expects no changes in his government's relations with saudi arabia
i don't anticipate anything based on the conversation we have had no he said
in an address to the nation his first televised appearance since becoming king salman offered his condolences to the saudi people
we will with god's will and power adhere to the straight path this country followed since its establishment by king abdulaziz and his sons after him and will not deviate at all from it since our constitution is the book of allah and the teachings of prophet mohammed he said
he also spoke of the desperate need for unity and solidarity among the followers of islam saying saudi arabia would continue to promote that
he had already issued six royal decrees friday the saudi press agency reported including appointing prince mohammed bin naif bin abdulaziz as the deputy crown prince
salman who has one point three three million followers on twitter but follows no one changed his twitter handle to kingsalman
abdullah became king of the oil rich nation a key u.s. ally in the middle east in august two thousand and five
but he had been running saudi arabia since one thousand nine hundred and ninety six after half brother king fahd's stroke
in the context of the kingdom's conservative circles abdullah was seen as a reformer and often came up against more hardline clerics
after ascending to the throne abdullah took steps toward broader freedoms and invested some of the country's vast oil wealth in large scale education and infrastructure projects
he was really quite extraordinary figure
he was probably the most progressive and liberal minded king of saudi arabia since king faisal which is a long time ago in the early one thousand nine hundred and seventy s cnn's fareed zakaria said about abdullah whom he described as much loved
i had the opportunity to meet with him once and what you got a sense of was somebody who really was determined to move his country forward zakaria said
it's a conservative country and a conservative society and he kept emphasizing that to me but he was very clear in the direction he wanted to go
however resistance from conservative factions hindered some of his efforts leaving many women in particular disappointed by a lack of progress toward greater independence
under abdullah's leadership the country slowly squashed al qaeda capturing or killing its leaders in the kingdom forcing the remnants underground and sidelining radical preachers
it also took a more prominent role in international affairs
last year it became the lead arab nation in a u.s. led coalition to eradicate the ultraradical isis group in iraq and syria
analysts are predicting a smooth political transition despite the many challenges facing saudi arabia including iran the rise of isis the crisis in yemen and the drop in oil prices
saudi arabia has sixteen percents of the world's known oil reserves according to the u.s. energy information administration
the country is widely seen as the leader of opec and has a large influence on energy prices and political stability in the middle east
remember the last time the price of oil fell like this the soviet union collapsed said zakaria
that said the successor is a very competent man
he added
i don't expect any major shift but it marks a big change and we'll have to see what the new king is like

the case of raif badawi has garnered international headlines and global outrage
badawi started a blog called free saudi liberals in two thousand and eight to encourage discussion about islam particularly the intrusion of the nation's religious police in saudis personal lives
he was officially charged with adopting liberal thought founding a liberal website and insulting islam
a jeddah court convicted him of insulting islam and handed down a ten year prison term and ordered that be whipped one thousand times
badawi received his first fifty lashes in the second week in january and was taken back to prison
he was supposed to be beaten again the third week but saudi officials postponed that due to medical advice the blogger's wife said
on wednesday a medical committee of about eight doctors assessed badawi at king fahd hospital in jeddah and determined he was too injured to withstand the beatings this week according to amnesty
instead of continuing to torment raif badawi by dragging out his ordeal with repeated assessments the authorities should publicly announce an end to his flogging and release him immediately and unconditionally said said boumedouha deputy director of amnesty international's middle east and north africa program
raif badawi is still at risk
there is no way of knowing whether the saudi arabian authorities will disregard the medical advice and allow the flogging to go ahead boumedouha said
oped
has saudi arabia bought the world's silence on human rights abuses 

to the south yemen is in chaos
to the north the militant group isis is wreaking havoc in iraq and syria
more broadly saudi arabia remains locked in a regional cold war with iran
within the kingdom's borders salman has to decide how to pace sensitive reforms while keeping a lid on extremism
the stakes are high in one of the leading regional powers in the middle east and a key u.s. ally
saudi arabia has been critical to preserving some degree of regional stability in the face of a growing iranian threat during the rise of islamic extremism that followed the u.s. invasions of afghanistan and iraq and during the new wave of upheavals that began in the spring of two thousand and eleven anthony h. cordesman a middle east expert at the center for strategic and international studies wrote in a commentary this month
here are some of the main challenges salman now faces
the new king has been plunged straight into the deep end with a fast developing crisis on saudi arabia's southern border
the pro saudi government in yemen has crumbled amid sectarian unrest
the country's president and prime minister resigned thursday night after a move by shiite houthi rebels to gain power in the capital in recent days
sunni majority saudi arabia which provides energy and financial support to yemen and shares a long border with it is looking on with growing anxiety fearful of the prospect of another shiite dominated state in the region
this will terrify the saudis just as the shia uprising in bahrain did said cnn intelligence and security analyst bob baer
saudi arabia all these years has avoided sending troops into yemen
it's a quagmire for the saudis said baer
they've got a reinforced border and they've put a lot of troops down there
but still they are panicking
mohammed albasha a spokesman for the yemeni embassy in washington told cnn on wednesday that without saudi support yemen will become a failed state
it's not far from that already
the poorest country in the region yemen is home to al qaeda in the arabian peninsula which u.s. officials consider to be the most dangerous branch of the terrorist network according to cnn terrorism analyst paul cruickshank
the yemen crisis feeds into a broader issue for saudi arabia
the growing influence of iran in the region
yemeni officials have frequently accused iran of providing financial support and weapons to the houthis in an effort to control yemen's red sea coast on one of the world's busiest shipping lanes
that makes saudi arabia very uncomfortable said cnn global affairs analyst bobby ghosh
saudi arabia a sunni majority country regards shia run iran as a mortal enemy
both are facing each other off in a bizarre game of chess they're playing across the arab world
tensions have simmered between tehran and riyadh at least as far back as iran's islamic revolution in one thousand nine hundred and seventy nine
the conflict in syria has been viewed as a proxy conflict between the two with iran supporting the regime of president bashar al assad and saudi arabia helping rebel groups
but the rise of the isis extremists amid the relentless bloodshed of the syrian war has complicated the equation
there are signs by the saudis and the iranians that it is in their interests to de escalate tensions to confront isis said harith al qarawee a fellow at harvard's radcliffe institute for advanced study
but it's impossible to move from hostility to alliance quickly
although the two sides realize that isis is a threat to some extent to both of them they don't think it is so big a threat as to move that fast to cooperation he said in november
the bloodthirsty seizure of large swathes of territory in syria and iraq by isis has created a major headache in the region for the saudis
and the attempts of isis leader abu bakr al baghdadi to style himself as spiritual leader of muslims presents a challenge to the saudi monarchy which is responsible for islam's two holiest cities mecca and medina
the saudis fear it as a potential domestic threat turning salafism into a revolutionary political ideology rather than the pro regime bulwark it has usually been in saudi arabia says f. gregory gause iii a senior foreign policy fellow at the brookings institution in doha qatar
saudi arabia is considered to be a key u.s. ally in the fight against isis
one of salman's sons prince khaled was reportedly among the pilots who carried out the first airstrikes on isis positions in syria last year
but salman also has some responsibility for saudi arabia's backing of jihadist fighters in previous conflicts according to david andrew weinberg a senior fellow at the foundation for defense of democracies
salman played a significant role in the one thousand nine hundred and eighty s and one thousand nine hundred and ninety s gathering support in the royal family for mujahedeen holy warriors in places like afghanistan places like the balkans weinberg told cnn
a number of these afghan and balkan veterans have in fact come back to saudi arabia and sown continued radicalism
the saudi government though has denied ever providing support to isis which is a splinter group of al qaeda
salman's predecessor king abdullah is credited with managing to ride out the ructions of the arab spring that swept away other arab rulers
but with a fast growing population in an unstable region the royal family has no room for complacency
saudi arabia has faced and will face constant challenges in finding the pace of modernization and reform that pushes forward as fast as possible while retaining saudi popular support meeting saudi arabia's unique religious and cultural needs and ensuring that evolution will not turn into either regression or revolution said cordesman
as events in other parts of the region since two thousand and eleven have shown all too clearly it is easy to get things terribly wrong and very hard to keep them going right he wrote
while some observers have applauded abdullah's cautious reforms others say he moved too slowly
if you look at where saudi arabia is today it hasn't actually moved that far from when he assumed the throne in two thousand and five weinberg told cnn
the monarchy needs to allow greater freedoms for women improve the rights of the shiite minority modernize the education system and give greater powers to elected bodies according to cordesman
with the recent sharp drop in oil prices officials will have to chart a careful course for the economy
saudi arabia depends heavily on oil revenues to fund its government
above all the saudi government needs to ensure that its rapidly growing population will have meaningful jobs and futures cordesman said

his two decades at the helm of one of the west's key strategic allies in the muslim world left an indelible if ambiguous legacy
here are the five most notable characteristics of his reign
hopes were high that abdullah's reputation as a modernizing reformer would translate into gains for women in the ultraconservative kingdom
but in the face of deep seated cultural opposition to change the progress was less than expected said cnn's senior international correspondent nic robertson
he promised a lot of reforms but
he was limited by the conservative nature of saudi society
abdullah was the first saudi monarch to appoint women to government positions
in two thousand and thirteen he appointed thirty women to the one hundred and fifty member shura council the top consultative body that plays an advisory role within saudi arabia's absolute monarchy
this year women will be able to vote and run as candidates in municipal elections for the first time and women have been elected to boards of chambers of commerce
but many other restrictions on saudi women remain
women can not marry leave the country go to school or open bank accounts without permission from a male guardian usually their father or husband
saudi arabia remains the only country where women are not allowed to drive despite petitions and civil disobedience campaigns by activists in recent years
in november the shura council recommended that the ban be lifted with restrictions but the recommendation has not been acted on and those who defy the ban continue to be prosecuted
robert w. jordan who served as u.s
ambassador to saudi arabia form two thousand and one to two thousand and three said he had frequent conversations with abdullah about human rights including the rights of women in the kingdom
he said don't push us to breaking point jordan told cnn
it's a halting kind of process of reform one that requires this kind of juggling
ali al ahmed a former saudi political prisoner and the director of the institute for gulf affairs said abdullah's reputation as a reformer in some quarters was unwarranted
the kingdom has been under international scrutiny in recent weeks for carrying out harsh punishments including executions and floggings
reforms in saudi arabia do not exist
this is an absolute monarchy let's be honest he said
the september eleven two thousand and one attacks on saudi arabia's key ally in which fifteen of the nineteen attackers were saudi were an inflection point for the kingdom
abdullah lobbied for the removal of u.s. troops who had been stationed in the country since one thousand nine hundred and ninety a prime grievance for the september eleven attackers then set about bolstering its military with a one hundred and fifty billion dollar spend
attacks on residential compounds housing many westerners in which dozens were killed led to a harsh crackdown on terrorist elements within the kingdom seeking to topple the house of saud
leaders were captured followers driven underground and radical preachers sidelined said robertson
saudi arabia has taken a lead role in the u.s. led international coalition fighting the radical sunni terror group isis which now rivals al qaeda as the world's most prolific jihadist group in syria and iraq
but questions remain about the links between saudi arabia and islamist terror
in an interview with cnn's christiane amanpour in october billionaire saudi businessman prince alwaleed bin talal acknowledged that unfortunately some extremists in saudi arabia
did fund certain extremist elements in syria but insisted that the support had been stopped
others argue that wahhabism the puritan form of sunni islam that is the kingdom's official religion promoted throughout the muslim world provides the ideological breeding ground for such groups
saudi arabia now faces a threat from isis on its on border
earlier this month isis allegedly attacked a saudi border patrol near arar
the kingdom is building a massive fence along its border with iraq in order to keep the militants out said robertson
one of abdullah's greatest legacies has been his focus on modernizing the saudi education system said mark weston author of prophets and princes
saudi arabia from muhammad to the present
following a failed attempt in one thousand nine hundred and seventy nine by extremist insurgents to capture mecca's grand mosque and topple the saudi leadership the kingdom responded by becoming even more conservative said robertson
this renewed puritanism was reflected in the education system for two decades until abdullah began an ambitious program of modernization despite opposition from religious conservatives
the centerpiece is the king abdullah scholarship program which has sent hundreds of thousands of young saudis abroad to study at the government's expense
the aim is to develop a workforce of saudi nationals capable of replacing expatriate workers in higher skilled jobs in the kingdom but also to bring a more modern international outlook to the kingdom
giving these scholarships recognizes that the road of modernizing saudi arabia comes from education said robertson
at home the country's first coeducational campus king abdullah university of science and technology was founded amid some objections in two thousand and nine
in expressing his condolences u.s. president barack obama credited abdullah for his commitment to the education of his country

who is saudi arabia's new king salman 
while abdullah's legacy as a social reformer is up for debate his achievements at economic reform are more clear cut say observers
besides his educational reform the late king's other lasting achievement was joining the world trade organization in two thousand and five integrating his country into the global economy said weston
abdullah opened his country up for foreign direct investment and committed huge sums of the country's oil wealth on infrastructure and mega projects such as the eighty six billion dollar king abdullah economic city announced in two thousand and five
the reforms reflected abdullah's recognition of the need to diversify the country's economy ahead of the inevitable day the oil money ran out said robertson
saudi arabia also lifted its international profile under abdullah's rule with the late king taking a strong role in regional and world affairs
obama in expressing his condolences praised the monarch for his bold steps in advancing middle east peace initiatives and for greater outreach to the international community
during his reign saudi arabia became the only arab nation with a seat at the g twenty and the first custodian of the two holy mosques as the saudi monarchs are known to meet the pope
abdullah espoused a message of religious tolerance despite the strictures of saudi wahhabism said robertson

they call themselves the eyes and ears of nuba a reference to the mountains from which they fled
young mainly in their twenty s sometimes younger these student refugees share a similar narrative
their villages tucked away in the remote regions of south kordofan in the sudan became uninhabitable
they were rained down on with rockets
they could no longer grow food keep cattle go to school
they joined fifteen thousand other refugees in ajuong thok camp in south sudan
now they want their stories to be heard
they are citizen journalists in the making
last november kathryn mahoney a communication officer for the united nations high commissioner for refugees and a self described repository of stories launched an initiative that trained twenty one students from the community in digital storytelling through smartphones
i travel around and meet these amazing refugees who have been through some of the most horrifying situations and my responsibility is to help them get their story out to amplify their voice she says
but as humanitarians we forget that these are their stories to tell
at first she recalls the students didn't know how to turn the phones on
growing up in the west we take for granted our visual literacy
we're literally bombarded with images from the moment we wake up to the moment we go to sleep
these students don't come from that culture so even with issues like framing and point of view we were really starting from scratch she recalls
by the end of the course mahoney says they knew how to use the phones better than i did
the phones have since gone to the local school which has adopted a kind of lending library for other students who want to learn photojournalism skills and sign the equipment out
the students paired the photos they took with a narrative
some opted for straight quotes from their subjects a la humans of new york
others wrote essays

the dead were mainly killed by arson attacks on buses and cars police said
the two most recent victims who died of their injuries in hospital thursday were victims of bomb blasts
the opposition bangladesh nationalist party along with nineteen allied parties called for general strikes and a nationwide blockade on road rail and river transport on january five the first anniversary of disputed elections
the bnp and its allies boycotted those elections with bnp leader and former prime minister khaleda zia arguing they would have been rigged by the government and refusing to participate unless they were conducted under a neutral caretaker administration
her arch rival prime minister sheikh hasina of the awami league refused to concede to the demands and coasted to victory
more than half of the parliament's three hundred seats went uncontested
voting was conducted under neutral caretaker governments in bangladesh from one thousand nine hundred and ninety one until two thousand and ten when the system was scrapped by the governing awami league
communications minister obaidul quader said wednesday that at least seven drivers and their assistants on public transport were among those killed in the renewed violence which has seen two hundred buses torched in recent weeks
the government has also blocked viber whatsapp and other messaging apps which it says are being used to coordinate the protests
industry minister amir hossain amu who heads a government committee on law and order said security forces have detained some seven thousand and fifteen people in recent weeks who are still being held
bnp secretary general mirza fakhrul islam alamgir is among those arrested
the bnp claims the true number under arrest is higher
the government is offering a reward of one hundred thousand taka for information leading to the arrest of any of those behind the attacks amu said
bangladesh politics has been dominated by zia and hasina for decades with both enjoying multiple stints in power
hasina the daughter of bangladesh's first president sheikh mujibur rahman was first elected prime minister in one thousand nine hundred and ninety six while zia widow of assassinated president ziaur rahman first became pm in one thousand nine hundred and ninety one
hasina has blamed zia for the violence and accused the opposition of trying to foment chaos while zia has denied her party is responsible saying the violence is the work of the government
both zia and hasina have frequently called for mass protests while in opposition
both their parties had planned rallies on the january five anniversary of the two thousand and fourteen election
after police banned the rallies the opposition proceeded
zia was confined to her office by police at the beginning of the protests which the government said was for her own security
she has since been released

firstly i think i must want for the record to refer to the events that have taken place in the last three weeks
and i just wish to reiterate and to reaffirm the statements which have already been made on my behalf by buckingham palace he said thursday at the world economic forum
earlier this month buckingham palace issued a statement which said it is emphatically denied that the duke of york andrew had any form of sexual contact or relationship with the woman
any claim to the contrary is false and without foundation
andrew is a son of queen elizabeth ii and a brother of prince charles the next in line for the british throne
the prince is accused of having sex with the woman when she was seventeen details of which are is a sworn affidavit in florida court dated january nineteen
the woman said that she and the prince had sex three times including one orgy
the court documents showed that her lawyers had sent a letter to buckingham palace asking to interview the prince under oath
in her sworn affidavit the woman described buckingham palace's denial that sexual contact ever took place between the pair as false and hurtful to me
the woman identified by buckingham palace as virginia roberts first named the prince in a civil motion filed december thirty in the u.s. district court in southern florida in which she claims she was forced to have sex with several men
she is referred to as jane doe no
three in the legal filings
in the letter the woman's lawyers sent to buckingham palace attorneys paul cassell and bradley edwards asked to interview prince andrew under oath regarding interactions that you had with jane doe no
three beginning in approximately early two thousand and one
jane doe no
three was then seventeen years old
the letter includes a picture of the woman and andrew which was taken around that time they say
the lawyers also want to discuss subsequent interactions with their client in new york city later that year the letter says
the interview could be conducted at a time and place of your choosing and with your cooperation i believe the interview could be completed in two hours or less it says
new court pleadings involving the relationship between jane doe no
three and the prince are being prepared the letter adds but their filing will be delayed if andrew accepts the interview request by january nineteen
the attorney for her legal team confirmed to cnn that buckingham palace had refused to accept the letter to prince andrew and that it was returned to them
buckingham palace didn't respond thursday when asked by cnn about the letter
but the woman's allegations have previously been firmly rejected by buckingham palace
it is emphatically denied that the duke of york had any form of sexual contact or relationship with virginia roberts
any claim to the contrary is false and without foundation the palace said early this month
prince andrew is named in the court filing in florida as one of a number of prominent people who allegedly had sexual contact with teenage girls through self made billionaire jeffrey epstein who pleaded guilty some years ago in florida to a state charge of prostitution solicitation
cnn was unable to reach martin weinberg epstein's attorney on thursday
in her first sworn statement to the court jane doe no
three gave more details of the alleged encounters
epstein made me have sex with prince andrew several times she said according to the court document
i had sex with him three times including one orgy
i knew he was a member of the british royal family but i just called him andy 
one day when she was in london she said epstein told her she would be meeting a major prince
she continued
epstein told me to exceed everything i had been taught
he emphasized that whatever prince andrew wanted i was to make sure he got
when the prince arrived she was introduced she said and we kissed formally cheek to cheek
the group went for dinner and to a nightclub where she was served alcohol before returning to the townhouse
the picture referred to in the letter of the prince with roberts was taken there she said
after the pair were left alone she said we went to the bathroom and bedroom which were just steps away from where the picture was taken
we engaged in sexual activities there
afterwards andy left quickly with his security
she said she had reported back to epstein on the encounter next day telling him it went great
i told epstein about andy's sexual interests in feet
epstein thought it was very funny
epstein appeared to be collecting private information about andy she added
roberts also gave details of two more alleged occasions when the pair had sex
one was in epstein's new york mansion in spring two thousand and one she said when she was seventeen
the third and last occasion was at an orgy involving nine girls on epstein's private island in the u.s. virgin islands her statement said
i was around eighteen at the time
epstein andy approximately eight other young girls and i had sex together
the other girls who appeared to be under eighteen were european looking and sounding and didn't really speak english she said
she said she felt disgusted after the orgy
roberts rejected the palace's denial of the allegations and said she hoped andrew would agree to be interviewed under oath
i did have sexual contact with him as i have described here under oath she said
given what he knows and has seen i was hoping that he would simply voluntarily tell the truth about everything
roberts and another woman are seeking to join two other women who are arguing in federal court for the u.s. government to reexamine its case involving epstein
the investment banker agreed to a state plea deal in two thousand and seven and began serving an eighteen month sentence in two thousand and eight according to court documents
he pleaded guilty to solicitation of prostitution and procurement of a minor for prostitution

in the post titled to the youth in europe and north america ayatollah ali khamenei calls on young people to seek out their own understanding of islam and he criticizes the media's portrayal of muslims following the massacre of sixteen people at the french satirical magazine and at a kosher supermarket in paris this month
the recent events in france and similar ones in some other western countries have convinced me to directly talk to you about them khamenei's letter reads
i am addressing you the youth not because i overlook your parents rather it is because the future of your nations and countries will be in your hands
and also i find that the sense of quest for truth is more vigorous and attentive in your hearts
the paris attacks which have provoked a wave of anti islam protests in the west were retribution for charlie hebdo's lampooning of islam over the years
the magazine's first issue after the attack which features a caricature of the prophet mohammed on its cover has sparked demonstrations across the muslim world
but the leader of iran where chants of death to america have been a familiar refrain at friday prayers and parliamentary sessions since the islamic republic's founding in one thousand nine hundred and seventy nine strikes a more conciliatory tone in his message to young people in the west
i don't insist that you accept my reading or any other reading of islam his letter reads
what i want to say is
don't allow this dynamic and effective reality in today's world to be introduced to you through resentments and prejudices
don't allow them to hypocritically introduce their own recruited terrorists as representatives of islam
khamenei also riffs on western history explaining that the united states and europe have a long tradition of oppressing people of color and non christians
he describes his admiration for chastened western historians who are in his words deeply ashamed of the bloodsheds wrought in the name of religion between the catholics and protestants or in the name of nationality and ethnicity during the first and second world wars
khamenei calls on readers to ignore media portrayals of islam
receive knowledge of islam from its primary and original sources
gain information about islam through the qur'an and the life of its great prophet he writes
why does the power structure in the world want islamic thought to be marginalized and remain latent 
khamenei asks readers to ask themselves then
i would like you not to allow the derogatory and offensive image buildings to create an emotional gulf between you and the reality
the supreme leader finishes with a hopeful message that future generations would write the history of this current interaction between islam and the west with a clearer conscience and lesser resentment
khamenei's letter comes at a time of thawing relations between iran and the u.s. as the two longtime adversaries try to hammer out a deal on the future of iran's nuclear program
barack obama even sent a letter to khamenei in october pointing out that they share a common enemy in isis the sunni islamist terror group that has seized huge chunks of syria and iraq
but diplomatic progress has not stopped the ayatollah from bashing the west on social media in recent months
he called the u.s. the enemy on twitter two weeks ago in a tweet about nuclear talks and in august he blasted the treatment of african americans in a tweet about the protests after the police killing of an unarmed black teen in ferguson missouri
and in november khamenei tweeted a nine point explanation of why israel should be annihilated a comment that infuriated israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu who urged western powers to pull out of nuclear negotiations with iran
khamenei's letter in full can be read here

the driver cheerfully ignores the doctor's pleas and continues to take the corners at a clip smoking all the while and occasionally breaking into wailed bursts of kurdish folk song
we're traveling from sanandaj the capital of iran's kurdistan province to marivan a small city just a few kilometers from the border with iraq
it's the final day of nowruz the iranian new year and my companions a doctor called ghaffar and a taxi driver named jahan both from sanandaj are still on holiday
in a typical display of iranian hospitality they've offered to accompany me on the journey
to the left of the narrow road is a vertical sand colored mountain wall
to the right a fifty foot drop and a view across the spectacular howraman valley a sparsely populated and beautiful part of the region
on the eastern edge of iran kurdistan province makes up part of a broader kurdish region which also spans adjacent sections of iraq syria and turkey
over the border in iraq the territory has been targeted by the islamic militant group known as isis but iranian kurdistan remains unaffected a peaceful world away from the violence
it also seems a world away from iran
although we're still within iran's borders the kurdistan region is quite different and more traditionally persian compared to the country's heartland
culturally and linguistically the residents here have more in common with their fellow kurds across the border than with iranians from tehran esfahan or shiraz
dress is traditional
men sport baggy shalwar trousers plain shirts and heavy felt waistcoats while the women wear colorful dresses and headscarves rather than the black chador or hijab seen throughout much of the rest of iran
on the way we stop in a tiny village called negel
the mosque in the village is home to large handwritten quran said to be about one thousand three hundred years old
the mosque's facade carries an inscription naming abu bakr the first caliph and according to sunni muslims the rightful successor of the prophet mohammed
although most iranians are shia muslims the kurds are predominantly sunni and this has often put them at odds with the iranian government
a few days earlier a kurdish man in sanandaj had told me that police had forcibly removed a satellite dish from his roof to prevent him receiving kurdish television channels
another had pointed at a photo of a shia cleric in my guidebook and shaken his head saying not good not good
after negel the road winds through snow capped mountains and then drops down into the village of howraman at takht
here the houses are built into the steep hillside with the roof of one doubling as a porch area for the building behind it
large blue or green latticed windows face out over the valley
children chase each other around the streets
wandering down the hillside we stop near a stream to drink tea bought from a small shop
as in other parts of iran people don't sweeten their tea directly preferring to place a sugar cube between their front teeth and then sucking the tea through the sugar
the teashop owner asks me where i come from
russ stan french stan 
he guesses
i tell him england stan and he smiles
welcome
as we drink the tea an elderly man walks to the edge of the stream removes his shoes and socks rolls up his trousers and wades out to a large flat rock in the stream
he washes his hands feet and head and then begins his afternoon prayers in turn standing kneeling and then pressing his forehead to the rock
once he's finished he carefully negotiates the way back and dries his feet with a cloth
as we continue the journey the doctor takes over the driving and progress is slower but the hairpin bends are no longer quite so terrifying
we arrive at marivan in the late afternoon
a large lake catches the afternoon sun and we stop at a restaurant at its edge
some friends of dr. ghaffar join us for a meal of barbecued fish rice and pickled vegetables
we sit cross legged on the floor and drink more black tea
afterward music is played and people lock arms and dance in a line men at one end and women at another jumping in unison and kicking their feet in time to the music
one of the women's veils slips back off her hair but no one pays much attention
the dancing goes on until the sun sets over the lake
we leave marivan and head back toward sanandaj
the doctor's phone rings and he talks in rapid farsi before suggesting we stop at a friend's house on the way
my friend is very wealthy he tells me and he can trace his family back one thousand three hundred years
we stop on the outskirts of sanandaj
the friend's house is certainly that of a rich man
thickset gold picture frames enclose black canvases covered in intricate persian script thickly woven carpets are laid out across the floor and a huge flat screen tv sits in the corner blaring out kurdish pop music
before stepping further inside i remind myself that it's not polite to shake hands with women in iran
as i'm mentally congratulating myself on my cultural sensitivity the sister of the owner of the house steps forward confidently shakes my hand and invites me to sit on the sofa
huge bowls of sweets and cashew nuts are laid out
i sit next to the man's eldest daughter who takes out her iphone and shows me photos on her instagram feed
most of the images are of western fashion models
i ask her why and she says
model is the best job
she plans to go to university in tehran and wants to study german but her long term ambition is to leave iran and she has many questions about life in the west
it's late and after more dancing this time in the marble floored living room to the music coming from the tv it's time to go
jahan drives back toward the center of sanandaj
he sings in kurdish again but this time there's a more melancholy tone to the song
how to get there
british canadian and u.s. citizens wishing to travel to iran must do so as part of an official tour due to restrictions on independent travel
most other foreign nationals need to obtain a visa before traveling and the application process can sometimes seem slightly opaque
it's worth checking the most up to date visa requirements ahead of traveling as these can change with little notice
a variety of airlines fly to iran with tehran's imam khomeini international airport the main international hub
once in iran getting around is made straightforward by the country's comfortable extensive and relatively cheap bus or train networks while for longer distances internal flights are an option
for shorter journeys and day trips taxis are relatively affordable due to low fuel costs
in tehran the metro is a good way to dodge the city's heavy traffic

the resignations of yemeni president abdu rabu mansour hadi and other officials are the latest fallout from the houthis move in recent days to gain power in the capital which included kidnapping hadi's chief of staff on saturday and taking over the presidential palace on tuesday
the chaos in yemen is cause for concern far beyond the country's borders
for the united states and its allies yemen's government has been a key ally in the fight against al qaeda in the arabian peninsula the yemen based group linked to attacks such as the recent slaughter at french magazine charlie hebdo
the united states responded by reducing embassy personnel in the capital because of security concerns a senior state department official said thursday night
while the embassy remains open and is continuing to operate we may continue to re align resources based on the situation on the ground the official said
the cabinet and prime minister khaled bahah resigned before hadi did on thursday night with bahah telling hadi in a letter that they essentially wanted to wash their hands of destructive political chaos an apparent reference to the deal that was to give houthis more power
we resigned so that we are not made party to what is going on and what will happen bahah wrote in the letter which yemeni information minister nadia sakkaf posted on twitter
hadi's resignation came soon afterward
it wasn't immediately clear who would succeed hadi
the houthis latest push to power picked up steam on saturday
the houthi rebels shiite muslims who have long felt marginalized in the majority sunni country kidnapped presidential chief of staff ahmed bin mubarak in the capital sanaa on saturday
the rebels then took over the presidential palace tuesday prompting talk of a coup
the tentative deal reached wednesday called for bin mubarak's release as well as measures to give the houthis more political power according to a yemeni official with access to a draft text of the agreement
but by thursday before the top officials quit sakkaf questioned whether the rebels would live up to their side of the pact
ahmed mubarak is still houthis hostage despite deal
they got what they want why should they fulfill their promise 
she said on twitter
she added i have been following up the promises to release dr. ahmed bin mubarak since the beginning
conclusion
buying time
mistrust was hampering the implementation of the peace deal both sides said thursday
one yemeni presidential adviser told cnn the government was waiting for the houthis to release bin mubarak but acknowledged that the rebels have withdrawn some forces
ahmed al bahri a houthi official said they were unsure of how serious hadi was about the deal and that they were keeping twenty percents of their militia numbers in the presidential palace and other key buildings as a guarantee
questions about who was in charge over the past few days have sparked concerns that a power vacuum could help terrorist groups get a stronger foothold
besides the charlie hebdo attack aqap also tried to blow up a plane landing in detroit in two thousand and nine
isis is also recruiting in yemen to expand its ranks
under the peace deal the houthi rebels agreed to withdraw their militias from key government institutions if officials take a significant step
rewriting parts of the country's constitution according to the yemeni official
under its terms the government would accept changes in the draft of the new constitution that would grant the houthis more political power
word of the deal still leaves many questions unanswered
what could the reshaped constitution look like 
how much power will the rebels get 
u.s. officials said they're unclear about the intentions of the houthis
do they want to run the government 
or be a powerful opposition 
there are currently no talks with the houthis but there are discussions about whether to talk to them according to u.s. officials
multiple policy options are being considered the officials said though there is no consensus yet about how to proceed
several of the constitutional changes sought by the houthis would emphasize the characteristics of yemen as a federal state and push for more inclusion of diverse groups
seven things to know about yemen
the houthis call for marginalized political groups to have the right to partnerships in state institutions and fair representation according to the text of the tentative agreement
in return for these government concessions the rebels basically agree to withdraw their fighters from the capital where they control or blockade several government installations
the presidential palace the presidential residence the prime minister's residence and a military installation where missiles are housed
a houthi official said the rebels would abide by the deal if the president follows a timeline specified in the negotiations for the political process
this isn't the first time the rebels and the government have hammered out an agreement
houthis swept into the capital last year sparking battles that left more than three hundred people dead in a month
in september they signed a ceasefire deal with the government and houthis have since installed themselves in key positions in the government and financial institutions
as violence flares seven things to know about yemen

the number of fighters killed has not been publicly discussed before but was disclosed by the u.s. ambassador to iraq stuart jones who told al arabiya television earlier in the day that an estimated six thousand fighters have been killed
jones said the military effort was having a devastating impact on isis
the estimate was calculated by u.s. central command and finds isis fighters have been killed in iraq and syria by coalition airstrikes according to a u.s. military official
centcom has kept a running estimate of fighters killed but has not made it public
u.s. intelligence estimates that isis has a total force of somewhere between nine thousand to eighteen thousand fighters
however it is also believed the group can draw on thousands of other fighters whose loyalty shifts and could muster a force upwards of thirty one thousand total
defense secretary chuck hagel would not confirm the six thousand deaths estimate instead saying thousands have been killed
on whether the body count is a sign of progress hagel said it's a measure but i don't think it's the measure
i was in a war where we did body counts and we lost that one hagel said referring to his service in vietnam
until now the pentagon has stayed away discussing the matter other than to estimate that thousands of fighters may have been killed
speaking to reporters thursday rear admiral john kirby was adamant that the us is not keeping a body count and said it would be wrong to state that there is such a count
he called it a tally and said the notion of a body count suggests vietnam war era statistics
in that war the pentagon offered body counts as a measure of its success against the viet cong
kirby said the tally was not aimed at showing any metric of success against isis
all of this comes after iraq has criticized the u.s. for not doing enough to help their fight against isis
the u.s. has long said airstrikes are aimed at degrading isis as a threat but would not by themselves get rid of the organization
secretary of state kerry speaking to reporters in london echoed the u.s. ambassador in saying the strikes have halted isis momentum and reclaimed more than seven hundred square kilometers from isis in iraq
in iraq airstrikes around mosul have been stepped up significantly in support of peshmerga fighters on the advance in the region
the effort now is to cut a key isis supply line into mosul a us military official said
the official stressed the us can not confirm the exact number but has based its calculation based on pilot reports and other intelligence gathered about a target before and after a strike


oh get over it
get over it and move on says the fifth most powerful women in the world according to forbes
i've failed myself
twice i tried to enter the national school of administration in the french system and i failed
legarde might have failed twice but the fifty nine year old is a woman of firsts
she is the first woman to chair the global law firm baker and mckenzie
the first female finance minister of france
and since two thousand and eleven the first woman to lead the imf
the mother of two's philosophy is to learn from her failures adding
and then you move on
moving on is something lagarde is trying to do now
last year magistrates placed lagarde under formal investigation in regards to a political fraud case dating back to her days as a french finance minister
lagarde is appealing the decision
but how does she cope with the weight of these allegations 
with strength with my sense of duty to my country with the certainty that i made the right choice at the time independently she said
we asked other women at the top of their fields about the biggest failures of their careers
like lagarde many said set backs can later become sources of great strength
my mother would tell me from a very young age never to be afraid of failing huffington told cnn's leading women
i was absolutely fine taking risks
trying to get into cambridge when everybody said you'll never get in or writing my first book when i was twenty three
a lot of things were likely to fail and many did fail
i mean my first book did well my second book was rejected by thirty six publishers
the sixty four year old has now written fourteen books
huffington's advice has been to embrace failure
you can recognize very often that out of these projects that may not have succeeded themselves that other successes are built she said
one of the iranian born briton's greatest professional disappointments was her rejected design for the cardiff bay opera house in wales in one thousand nine hundred and ninety five
hadid won the commission twice but her building never saw the light of day after it was thwarted by local politicians
i know a lot of people thought i would give up because it was such an awful painful experience
i remember the day it happened i thought i will not let this finish me she said
in a way it saved me
i think it did make me stronger
she's the self made chinese billionaire who's richer than donald trump and oprah winfrey
but it wasn't an easy rise to the top for forty nine year old property mogul xin who as a teenager worked in a factory before raising enough money to study in britain
did she come across a lot of failures 
every day
i mean i think that's just life says the mother of two with an estimated worth of two billion dollar
you will always bump into difficulties challenges and problems
it appears to be that we seem to be doing quite well but as it is now we're still having challenges every day
so i think that's just nothing unique
that's just life
described as the oprah of africa nigerian talk show host mosunmola abudu has interviewed such high profile guests as imf chief christine lagarde and former u.s. secretary of state hillary clinton
however one interviewee abudu still dreams of having on her program moments with mo is american talk show queen oprah winfrey
so far abudu has been unable to make contact with winfrey
but rather than knock the wind out of her sails it's made her all the more determined to change the face of african television
of course there were many knock backs along the way many people telling me you can't do these things said abudu
but i think what's important in life is that you believe in yourself and the things you can do

the announcement of the papyrus discovery and impending publication was made by craig evans professor of new testament at acadia divinity college in wolfville nova scotia
evans described the papyrus as a fragment of the gospel of mark
he added that a combination of handwriting analysis and carbon dating led him and his team of researchers to conclude that the fragment was written before ninety a.d
this would make it at least a decade older than other early fragments of the new testament and thus an invaluable resource for biblical scholars and object of considerable interest for christians the world over
the fragment according to evans was discovered when an egyptian mummy mask known as cartonnage was dismantled in a hunt for ancient documents
mummy masks were an important part of ancient egyptian burial practice but only the very wealthy could afford examples made of gold
the majority of mummy masks were made from scraps of linen and papyrus which were glued together into a kind of ancient papier mach
dismantling these masks yields a trove of ancient documents
evans claims that in addition to christian texts hundreds of classical greek texts records of business transactions and personal letters have been acquired
in the process the mask itself is destroyed
though it may be making headlines now the claim that the oldest known gospel has been discovered is not new
news of the fragment first came to light in two thousand and twelve when its existence was announced by daniel wallace founder of the center for the study of new testament manuscripts at dallas theological seminary
no one saw the text then and no one has seen it now
though it has been mentioned repeatedly by a select group of people who evidently have been given access to it its planned date of publication has been consistently pushed back from an original plan of two thousand and thirteen to two thousand and fifteen and now just this week all the way to two thousand and seventeen
despite the seemingly explosive quality of the news therefore it is important to take a step back and consider what is actually being revealed here
some people are saying they have this really old and important thing and they will show it to all the rest of us in a few years
it is unclear why anyone would start talking about a text like this a year indeed now at least two years in advance
the most important established fact about this papyrus at this point is that it has not yet been publishedwhich is to say only a small handful of individuals have seen the text and are able to say anything at all about it
as roberta mazza an ancient historian and papyrologist from the university of manchester in england told us the academic community has not been given access to firm information and images on the basis of which could eventually say something
in other words this sort of notice really serves mostly to remind us of just how little we know about this purported discovery
here for example are five key unanswered questions
what is the actual text on the papyrus 
we are told that it is from mark but after all no one has seen it
which part of mark 
is the handwriting consistent with the supposed dating 
brice jones a papyrologist at concordia university told us that dating a text by handwriting or paleography is not a precise science and i know of no papyrologist who would date a literary papryus to within a decade on the basis of paleography alone
is the ink or papyrus itself consistent with the supposed dating 
according to jones if paleography is inexact radiocarbon dating is equally problematic since one must allow for a time gap of a century or more
they say that these lab tests have all been done but as no one has actually seen the reports they are less than confirmatory
who owns the papyrus or the mask from which it was taken and from whom was it purchased and when 
the time and place of a text's discovery known as its provenance are crucial for verifying its authenticity especially in a period of extensive looting of archaeological sites and museum theft
according to international law if the mask was taken out of egypt after one thousand nine hundred and seventy it is officially unprovenanced and is effectively prohibited from being sold or published
evans told us i do not know the specifics about the provenance of this mask
who has seen the text who has verified it and who has studied it 
evans is not a trained papyrologist but is rather a scholar of the new testament
to this point none of the papyrologists text critics or other highly specialized experts who must have worked on this text before these claims could be made about it have been identified or spoken publicly about it
these questions are not necessarily challenges to the authenticity of the text
they are rather a recognition that until the scholarly world has been granted access to this papyrus the public statements made about it are no more revelatory than if we announced that we had found moses private copy of genesis in a hummus container and we'll show it to you later
there is however one bit of information about this text and its discovery that can be discussed now without having even seen it
the fact that it was uncovered by destroying an ancient egyptian mummy mask
evans said the cartonnage destruction was acceptable because we're not talking about the destruction of any museum quality piece
we are however talking about the destruction of two thousand year old egyptian antiquities
funeral masks painted with representations of people who lived and died and were commemorated by their families
we might wonder at the very least who it is that gets to determine which masks are worth preserving and which aren't
evans told us that such decisions are based on expert opinion but as to who exactly makes that determination he said i do not know specifically
evans has said we dug underneath somebody's face and there it was
he has since clarified that he was not personally involved in the destruction of the mask
but it is unclear precisely which individuals did the dirty work
evans language of digging makes the dissolving of mummy masks sound like archaeology but some would characterize it and some have as cultural vandalism
there is an implicit sense that the discovery of a rare christian piece outweighs the preservation of a relatively common egyptian artifact
and this may be so but surely the optics would be better if this were announced by someone from say the egyptian ministry of state for antiquities
the destruction of mummy masks though legal falls into an ethically gray area right now because of the difficult choices scientists have to make in the lab when working with them said douglas boin a professor of history at st. louis university
we have to ask ourselves do we value the cultural heritage of egypt as something worth preserving in itself or do we see it simply as vehicle for harvesting christian texts 
even if one agrees that these masks can be taken apart archaeology is by its very nature a destructive process it should be remembered that the process is a crapshoot
if a mask contains no texts then the equation changes and even a relatively unimportant cultural piece has been destroyed for nothing
mazza also reminded us that you do not need to completely destroy masks for getting out texts if you use methods developed and improved by papyrologists since one thousand nine hundred and eighty
if a mask is to be destroyed surely that process should be documented thoroughly with constant photography and annotation rather than undertaken as a classroom project with undergraduates using a bottle of palmolive and a little elbow grease
it is possible that the earliest text of the gospel of mark has been discovered
but until the world is given access to the papyrus through its publication there is no story here except that ancient egyptian mummy masks are being destroyed in the ongoing search for christian relics

successful methods such as chemotherapy work by killing the cancer cells but they also destroy healthy tissue
health practitioners have been searching for a magic bullet that goes straight to the source of the cancer and everything from monoclonal antibodies which carry cancer drugs direct to cancer cells to straight surgery to cut out tumors have been used with varying degrees of success
in belgium engineer and nuclear physicist yves jongen is pioneering a new therapy that targets cancers with proton radiation
a therapy that offers precision and minimal side effects
i started to designing equipment proton therapy of cancer that was a radically new idea jongen told cnn
encased in a two metre thick concrete bunker that serves as a radiation shield one of jongen's cyclotron machines produces proton beams to treat cancer patients
in this space we accelerate the protons and we give them a higher and higher velocity until they reach two thirds of the speed of light that's two hundred thousand km per second and this acceleration takes place in the shape of a spiral he said
that's needed if you want to be able to penetrate one foot into the body of a patient
once the proton beam has been generated it's piped into a treatment room where patients receive a powerful dose of targeted radiation that kills only those cancerous cells
it does a lot less collateral damage to the patient jongen said
that's the great thing about proton therapy
while proton therapy is a giant step forward it's not yet the magic bullet that clinicians are looking for
so far it is not effective against all types of cancer
there are a number of cancers which are not localized he said
if you look at leukemia which is cancer of the blood cells there is nowhere to shoot it's all through the body
the other drawback is that the cyclotron is not cheap
each system and the bunker needed to house it doesn't leave much change from one hundred and twenty five million dollar
currently there are just forty three operational particle therapy facilities worldwide with a total of one hundred and twenty one treatment rooms
as the fame of the process has started to spread some people have been taking desperate measures to get treatment
one british couple last year even sparked an international manhunt after they removed their son from hospital without doctors permission to get to a proton center in prague in the czech republic
proton treatment is limited on britain's national health service
just one center in the north of the country offers proton therapy for certain types of eye tumors
other centers however are currently in development
while the proton therapy market is expected to more than double by two thousand and eighteen with an estimated three hundred proton therapy rooms jongen's brussels based company iba is working on a smaller and cheaper model they hope will make proton therapy more accessible
it would be much less expensive making it more possible for a hospital to afford it a smaller system can already treat a relatively large number of patients per year
at the moment fewer than one percents of cancer patients are treated with proton therapy but jongen is hopeful that smaller and cheaper machines will be the game changer
i have a number of letters from parents of young kids saying if it had not been for this treatment we would have lost our kid he said
that's something i really cherish
when i feel a bit depressed for whatever reason i go back to those letters and they are very exciting

this week's two hundred million dollar demand in return for the lives of two japanese citizens perhaps represents a change of tactics from isis the group that now rules over large parts of syria and iraq as they realize that with the notable exceptions of the u.s. and the uk the willingness of western nations to resist making some form of payment in the face of youtube videos of their citizens begging for their lives is weak
is an unwavering resistance towards ransom payments a constructive position to take 
is offering no hope of some form of negotiated settlement in the best interest of a nation's citizens 
or would it in fact make more sense to take a flexible approach that operates on a case by case basis engages in negotiation and considers all possible options including ransom 
the arguments against payment are well rehearsed and oft repeated by those that attempt to hold the international line
since nine eleven the attempt to starve terrorist organizations of financing has been a cornerstone of the global effort to counter these groups
payment of ransoms to terrorist organizations for the safe return of citizens is thus entirely contrary to the blizzard of national and international laws and norms that have emerged
at a two thousand and thirteen summit in northern ireland world leaders noted that the international community has made significant progress in combating the flow of funds to terrorist organizations but also drew attention to the substantial financial benefit being earned through ransom payments and the incentive this provided for further kidnappings
following the g eight summit and notwithstanding the fact that in two thousand and nine the u.n. reminded member states of their obligation to prevent the payment of ransoms to terrorists under security council resolution one thousand nine hundred and four the security council passed a further resolution in january two thousand and fourteen calling upon member states to prevent terrorists from benefiting directly or indirectly from ransom payments
without doubt paying ransoms encourages more kidnappings it is a self perpetuating self reinforcing cycle
the u.s. administration argues that hostage takers looking for ransoms distinguish between those governments that pay ransoms and those that do not
and make a point of not taking hostages from those countries that refuse to make concessions
be that as it may the murder in two thousand and nine of british citizen edwin dyer by al qaeda in the islamic maghreb whilst his fellow swiss and german captives were freed following the reported payment of a substantial ransom shows that refusing to pay is risky
furthermore the procession of gruesome beheadings visited on american and british hostages by isis in two thousand and fourteen suggests that in the knowledge that the u.s. and uk will not pay ransoms captured citizens from these two countries are far more likely to be murdered in the pursuit of propaganda
while paying ransoms increases the risk of further kidnappings it also clearly increases the likelihood of a safe and successful outcome
offering to consider ransom demands introduces a critical prerequisite for success namely a willingness to negotiate
the secretive world of kidnap for ransom insurance provides a source of instructive insight
this industry bloomed following the kidnap ransom and death of the twenty month old baby son of u.s. aviator charles lindbergh
at the heart of the growth and success of this niche industry is its ability to respond to and engage with kidnappers normally via intermediaries
success is judged not only by the safe return of a captured individual but also by the ability to negotiate a price that is far removed from the opening ask
knowing that ransom payments to designated terrorist groups are illegal kfr specialists will quickly pass insured situations involving terrorist groups to government authorities and the outcomes are rarely as favorable as those that can be achieved via expert negotiation
periodically the facts presented to policymakers change and policymakers must adapt
such a moment for adaptation has arrived
kidnap for ransom is an increasingly widely used tool by terrorist groups
nasser al wuhayshi leader of yemen based al qaeda in the arabian peninsula which is estimated to have earned twenty million dollar from ransom between two thousand and eleven and two thousand and thirteen asserts that kidnapping hostages is an easy spoil and a profitable trade and a precious treasure
in several recorded messages al qaeda leader ayman al zawahiri has called for supporters worldwide to kidnap westerners
stomach churning as it may be to finance designated terrorists in recent months citizens of france germany denmark and italy have returned safely home
citizens of the uk and the u.s. have not
the point blank refusal to pay ransoms is wrong headed
a more nuanced approach that leaves all options including payment open for negotiation is much more likely to result in success








ashin wirathu the leader of the far right anti muslim nine hundred and sixty nine movement made the remarks about yanghee lee the u.n.'s special rapporteur on myanmar at a public rally on friday
don't assume you are a respectable person just because of your position he said in the speech footage of which was widely circulated on social media
to us you are just a whore
the comments drew a sharp response from the u.n. high commissioner for human rights zeid ra'ad al hussein who described wirathu's remarks as sexist insulting and utterly unacceptable
i call on religious and political leaders in myanmar to unequivocally condemn all forms of incitement to hatred including this abhorrent public personal attack he said in a statement released from geneva wednesday
it's intolerable for u.n. special rapporteurs to be treated in this way
lee was on a ten day visit reporting on the human rights situation in the predominantly buddhist southeast asian country which is emerging from a half century of military rule
she had spoken out about the crisis facing the country's one point three million strong rohingya muslim minority most of whom live under apartheid like conditions in rakhine state with limited access to adequate healthcare and education
since an outbreak of communal violence between buddhists and muslims in two thousand and twelve more than one hundred and thirty thousand live in wretched displacement camps they are forbidden to leave
lee also criticized proposed law changes backed by the monks including a bill restricting interfaith marriage and religious conversions
she made reference to wirathu's comments in a statement this week
during my visit i was personally subjected to the kind of sexist intimidation that female human rights defenders experience when advocating on controversial issues she said
wirathu was jailed in two thousand and three for inciting anti muslim violence but released in an amnesty nine years later
myanmar's minister of information and presidential spokesperson ye htut posted comments on his facebook page indicating he would ask the ministry of religious affairs to look into wirathu's speech

the safety of the civilian crew members and the environment are our top priorities
so we're taking this situation very seriously and will continue to investigate the situation until it's resolved said cmdr
william marks spokesman for the u.s. navy seven th fleet
last mission for storied class of warships
the u.s. navy identified the ship as the military sealift command prepositioning vessel usns sgt
matej kocak
the navy said it was stuck six nautical miles off uruma on the island of okinawa
the ship is stable right now marks said
any water found in the ship is just from the normal tide going in and out
tugs were at the location assessing the best way to free the vessel in conjunction with the japanese
the u.s. navy is working closely with japanese authorities to assess the situation and determine the best course of action to refloat the vessel the navy said
no leaks from the hull have been found and no damage to the surrounding area has been reported
the ship carries one hundred and thirty one crew members thirty eight civilians and sixty seven army and twenty six marine corps personnel the navy said

it's a rare frilled shark that has been caught by a fisherman in australia where no one remembers ever seeing one caught before
with a mouth packed full of needle like teeth and a body like an eel's the six foot long frilled shark is sometimes described as a fish fossil that dates back eighty million years
david guillot says that it's like nothing he or his fellow fisherman have ever seen in the deep waters in australia's southwest
it was really prehistoric looking freaky really guillot said
he caught the fish while trawling for fish at one thousand one hundred meters a week ago and thought he might have discovered some new type of shark
i've been fishing thirty years and never saw anything like it
so i brought it in he said by phone from his boat thursday
honestly we thought we had caught a brand new species maybe discovered something wild
the shark is known to live at extreme depths in both the atlantic and pacific oceans but is very infrequently caught because its habitat is mostly off limits to fishing said simon boaz of australia's south east trawl fishing industry association
guillot said that the frilled shark was still alive when he got it to the surface
but it did not live after being pulled up from the frigid depths
so he offered it to a local museum

the fatalities are among at least ten civilians killed total in addition to twenty injured in the shelling of four city districts in the past twenty four hours the donetsk city council said on its website
ukraine's state run ukrinform news citing the donetsk government reported eight dead and seven hospitalized in the bus stop attack alone
donetsk has been a stronghold for separatists who have been battling government forces for control of the donetsk and luhansk regions since the spring
as of now the situation remains difficult the city council said
and as has been the case with many incidents in the conflict there was no universally accepted explanation of what happened or who was responsible
russia's foreign ministry demanded an investigation and criticized ukraine for its shelling of ukrainian cities like donetsk which are controlled or at least full of pro russian separatists
yet ukraine's defense ministry blamed the rebels for the attack saying it was launched from areas they control
the organization for security and cooperation in europe which has a monitoring mission in ukraine is among those trying to get to the bottom of it all
its deputy chief monitor alexander hug told reporters that an ocse patrol saw seven bodies near a vehicle that had been hit
and it's not the only instance of violence in the area
terrorists using multiple launch missile systems precisely destroy houses in the donetsk region cities of debaltseve and avdiyivka ukrinform reported citing donetsk regional police chief vyacheslav abroskin
rebels captured sixteen wounded ukrainian soldiers after fighting at donetsk's airport kiev's military said according to ukrinform
negotiations are underway to secure their release
and the osce in an update posted wednesday cited numerous instances of shelling in recent days with two hospitals in separatist held territory among the buildings affected
as u.s. gen. philip breedlove nato's supreme allied commander europe pointed out thursday
violence has intensified and changed character in ukraine
as has been true so often in recent months the violence is happening around the same time as negotiations aimed at stopping it
the latest talks happened wednesday in berlin and included the foreign ministers of ukraine and russia as well as germany and france
their official aim was to resolve the crisis by hammering out how to implement a peace deal that was agreed upon last year
after wednesday's talks the four foreign ministers condemned the continuing violence and called for the peace deal that was reached in minsk belarus last september to be respected
fighting in the donetsk and luhansk regions has severely escalated causing the loss of many human lives including civilians
this must stop immediately and the regime of quiet must be restored the ministers said
they said tangible progress must be made on full implementation of the minsk pact ahead of a planned peace summit
the attack on the donetsk trolley bus station obviously doesn't help the situation
russia's foreign ministry called it a a crime against humanity a great provocation aimed to undermine the efforts for the peaceful settlement of the crisis
the unrest began in late two thousand and thirteen leading up to parliament's ouster last february of pro moscow president viktor yanukovych
russia annexed the crimean peninsula a few weeks later with fighting breaking out in april in two ukrainian regions bordering russia donetsk and luhansk
separatist leaders there declared independence from ukraine and sided with russia
but how much was and is moscow involved in their campaign 
it depends who you ask
officials in moscow have expressed sympathy for the separatists but denied any outright military support
however ukraine and its allies have accused russia of fomenting the rebellion by actively backing it
it is clear that russia has to stop supporting the separatists and respect international law said danish gen. knud bartels chairman of the military committee for nato which doesn't include ukraine but is working to further its military to military cooperation with kiev
on wednesday ukrainian president petro poroshenko reasserted a claim that russia sent troops across the border to support the rebels
we have more than nine thousand russian troops who so called lost the way crossing our russian ukrainian border bring with them hundreds and hundreds of tanks armed personnel carriers and killing ukrainian civilians and attacking ukrainian troops poroshenko told cnn
russian foreign minister sergey lavrov speaking in moscow before the berlin talks responded to ukraine's assertion with a firm denial much like other denials made by russian officials in recent months over similar allegations of armed intervention
as to the flow of troops and armaments this is not the first time we hear something like that he said
and each time i hear that i say if you're so confident about that please present us with facts but no one has been able to provide us with these facts

that teenager called kim disappeared in a southern turkish border city earlier this month leading authorities to suspect that he may have slipped away to syria to join isis
while police have not concluded that he joined the terror group authorities found he had a keen interest in the islamic militants
using a twitter profile picture of an isis flag he frequently tweeted i want join and asked to meet brothers
he followed pro isis accounts and often retweeted the group's propaganda
on his social media posts he claimed he was from chechnya and lamented that male are being discriminated against
i hate feminist he said according to a post on his twitter account on october five
so i like the isis
he retweeted arabic posts and tweeted in english but never in korean
his last tweet was sent on october ten which was the same month he began asking his mother if he could go to turkey according to seoul metro police agency
kim's mother told police that she had not been aware of his interest in isis
cnn was unable to reach kim's parents
south korea may not be a probable place for aspiring isis members with less than zero point three percents of the population identifying as muslim
but isis has expanded its reach globally
the islamic militant group has attracted disaffected youth from around the world including the united states france europe and australia
there have also been reports about recruits joining isis from asia triggering concerns in the region
why is isis so successful at luring westerners 
earlier last year there was a report of a chinese fighter caught in iraq in september
it's unclear how many chinese nationals may be fighting with isis but one former chinese special envoy to the middle east said there could be about one hundred
it remains unclear if some of them are uighur a muslim minority group in xinjiang
approximately three hundred and fifty southeast asians were estimated to be in iraq and syria said a singapore official during a security council meeting in november
currently two japanese hostages are held by isis with a demand for two hundred million dollar ransom
no word from isis on hostages
south korean police found about five hundred and seventeen searches for words affiliated with isis as well as over fifty images of isis members toting guns and holding women in kim's computer they said
in another social media account kim posted
i want leaving my country and families just want to get a new life
reza aslan a religious scholar and adjunct senior fellow at the council on foreign relations described a profile of young people who seek to join isis as feeling dispossessed or marginalized
they feel somewhat they're having a crisis of identity
the assumption is that the religiously zealous are the ones joining isis but that's not proven out by the data we have so far
kim began liaising with an individual whom he met on twitter over an encrypted messaging service police said
on january eight he arrived in turkey with a korean guardian
two days later he disappeared from a hotel in kilis a city near the syrian border
his guardian reported him missing to the south korean embassy in turkey on january twelve

chairi a twenty seven year old belgian comedian who performs with a humorous theatrical group that calls itself the muslim raiders was speaking several days after a deadly gun battle erupted last week between suspected jihadists and police in the eastern belgian town of verviers
news of the suspected belgian terror cell immediately sent ripples of fear through this small european country's muslim community
i was freaking out
really scared said chairi who fears young belgian born muslims could become victims of a backlash after the raid
my mom said no one can go out tonight because of what happened said camelia lakhdar
the nineteen year old waitress said her frightened mother made her skip work the night of the anti terror raid
both chairi and lakhdar were speaking in the lounge of a muslim youth center espace poincare
espace poincare opened little more than a year ago with the goal of promoting a peaceful and productive blend of european and islamic values
but the center's director said the recent reports of a suspected homegrown belgian terror cell emerging so soon after french jihadis massacred cartoonists in the paris office of the satirical magazine charlie hebdo had threatened this vision of moderation and integration
we condemn what's happened
this is not our vision our understanding of our religion said director hajib el hajjaji
in french accented english he explained how belgium's muslim community was finding itself increasingly trapped between two ideological extremes
we face islamist radicalization
but we also face the increase of islamophobia in belgium el hajjaji said
we know that stigmatization islamophobia discrimination help this radicalization of young muslim people here in belgium
the january fifteen raid in verviers resulted in the shooting deaths of two belgian citizens
police said they were found in possession of assault rifles handguns explosives and police uniforms
the suspects have been accused of being part of a plot to target belgian police inspired by the ultra violent ideology of isis
the gun battle triggered an international manhunt
since january fifteen belgian authorities have arrested and charged at least seven belgians with participation in a terrorist organization
the federal prosecutor's office announced three of the suspects were intercepted at the airport in brussels while trying to fly to greece with plans to then travel on to syria
a senior belgian counter terrorist official tells cnn the suspected leader of the verviers cell is a young belgian of moroccan descent named abdelhamid abaaoud
abaaoud who is still at large appeared in an isis propaganda video laughing and joking to the camera while driving a pick up truck that was dragging at least half a dozen corpses through a field
he also brought his teenage brother to syria who has since appeared in photos posing alongside isis fighters
he is not the only molenbeek native to embrace the isis jihad
there are several people who left here to fight in syria
and some who came back
that's the danger said molenbeek mayor francoise schepmans
she spoke to cnn in the neighborhood's central square which is ringed with halal butcher shops and grocery stores advertising their goods in french and arabic
a polyglot procession of residents many of them women wearing islamic headscarves strolled
in the side streets one could over hear conversations in french arabic and turkish
molenbeek has a large predominantly muslim population of first second and third generation immigrants from north africa
the mayor said the neighborhood also suffered from soaring youth unemployment estimated at more than forty percents
as part of their effort to stop the suspected isis linked cell in verviers belgian police have carried out multiple raids in molenbeek over the course of the last week
the defense attorney for a molenbeek native arrested by police last week said his client was innocent of terrorism charges
didier de quevy argued that his client an unemployed former twenty five year old security guard named marouane el bali did not fit the terrorist profile because he had no previous criminal record
he lives in molenbeek which is one of the neighborhoods most infested by terrorism and thus it's a miracle not to have problems with the authorities when you live there de quevy said
while unemployment is rampant online propaganda for isis bloody interpretation of jihad is often only a button click away
chairi the comedian who also hosts a radio show that touches upon belgian muslim affairs laments that his radicalized peers don't learn their islam in mosques or in institutions
they learn it on the internet
he recalled meeting a young muslim convert
just a few months after embracing islam in belgium chairi said he read in a newspaper that the young man was killed fighting on the battlefields of syria
it goes so fast
even the religious leaders they don't understand it chairi said
people radicalize themselves said el hajjaji director of point espace
el hajjaji says he has taken to social media to denounce online propaganda urging volunteers to join isis
but he confesses the jihadi message can be tempting to vulnerable youths
the speech to get you to go to syria is very simple
you have your enemy you want to have the power to build your future and you don't need to find a solution to the complexity of your life that we have here in belgium el hajjaji said
it is this toxic mix of unemployment marginalization and the clarion call of jihad that have helped make brussels the capital of europe a recruiting ground for terrorism

to all members of isis kenji goto is not the enemy of isis
please release him junko ishido goto's mother said in a statement thursday
there is so little time left before the deadline
isis has threatened in a video released tuesday to kill two japanese citizens goto and haruna yukawa if it doesn't receive two hundred million dollar in ransom from the japanese government
time is of the essence
the japanese government says it estimates isis ultimatum will expire at two fifty p.m. friday tokyo time
i sincerely apologize to the japanese government and all concerned foreign countries for all the trouble that my son has caused ishido said
i have been just crying for last three days filled with sadness
words fail to describe how i feel
kenji always has been a kind person ever since he was little
he was always saying i want to save the lives of children in war zones 
japanese officials have said they are doing their best to communicate with isis but japanese chief cabinet secretary yoshihide suga said thursday that tokyo had so far heard nothing and doesn't know what situation the two hostages are in
in a thursday news conference japanese chief cabinet secretary yoshihide suga said japan wants to secure the hostages safe release but will not yield to the threat of the terrorists
he said japan was trying to reach the isis captors through third parties such as governments in the region or local tribal leaders but has not been able to determine whether goto and yukawa are safe
we are aiming to save them as soon as possible suga said thursday
the government of jordan has told japan it will do as much as possible to try to secure the release of goto and yukawa according to suga
jordan one of the arab nations taking part in the u.s. led bombing campaign against isis already has its own challenge to deal with
the militant group last month captured a jordanian pilot whose plane crashed in syria
japanese officials have repeatedly stressed that their military which is constitutionally forbidden from taking action other than for self defense isn't involved in the international airstrikes against isis positions in syria and iraq
the masked militant speaking in the isis video linked the group's ransom demand to japanese prime minister shinzo abe's recent pledge of two hundred million dollar in financial aid to countries affected by the militant group
suga reiterated thursday that the funds japan has offered are for humanitarian purposes like helping refugees not military purposes
leading japanese news organizations have reported citing unidentified government sources that goto's wife got an e mail in december from someone demanding eight million dollar to sixteen million dollar for her husband's return
the government is trying to confirm if that e mail came from isis the reports said
if so it could indicate the militant group is willing to accept a smaller ransom than the two hundred million dollar it had publicly demanded
but the question is what if anything is japan willing to give
isis has a ruthless track record
it has released videos touting the killing of five western hostages since august
abe has called isis ultimatum over the two japanese men's lives unacceptable and said the international community shouldn't give in to terrorists
but he and other government officials haven't explicitly ruled out paying a ransom
some details have emerged about what spurred the two japanese citizens to travel thousands of miles to the bloody syrian conflict
while they had different professions the two men knew and talked to each other said yukawa's friend nobuo kimoto
goto an experienced freelance journalist made a video in october near the turkish syrian border before he embarked on a perilous journey into isis controlled territory
it is my responsibility if something happens he explained
goto forty seven said he was determined to cover what was happening in the region
syrian people suffering three years and a half
it's enough he said
so i would like to get the story of what isis wants to do
alaaeddin al zaim who had worked with goto in syria previously says he warned him not to enter the isis stronghold of raqqa
i tell him it's not safe for you al zaim told cnn
but goto chose to go anyway saying i am not american i am not british
i'm japanese
i can go al zaim recalled
before he left goto gave al zaim a slip of paper with contact information for friends and his wife the mother of his young children
after hearing no word from goto for a week al zaim says called the wife
when i called her she's a very strong woman he said
the aims and activities in syria of yukawa a forty two year old unemployed widower are murkier
he originally headed to the war ravaged country early last year with the aim of gaining combat and survival experience to bolster his plans to set up a private security company said his friend kimoto
there yukawa met goto who gave him insights on how to survive there kimoto said
he also introduced him to rebel fighters who are distinct from isis even though both are fighting against syrian president bashar al assad's forces
some of the rebels talked about their need for ambulances to shuttle the wounded
that plea spurred yukawa to start raising money for this cause after returning to japan according to kimoto
i felt a chill when he said after returning home he felt in syria he was really living a life kimoto said
he seems to have felt satisfaction being there and living together with the locals
yukawa went back to syria in july a trip that kimoto said he didn't know about at the time
kimoto said he had advised his friend to focus on building up his private security company
opinion
why countries should think about paying ransoms

the disturbing information comes from a yemeni official who told cnn on wednesday that isis has a presence in at least three provinces in southern and central yemen and there is now a real competition between isis and the yemen based terror group al qaeda in the arabian peninsula or aqap
that competition manifested itself in a gun battle between the two groups in yemen's eastern provinces last month the same official said though he did not have specifics on the casualties that resulted from that incident
american officials do think isis is trying to recruit in yemen
but one u.s. counter terror official stressed the view that aqap remains the dominant force there
the american intelligence view is that while there may be a smattering of isis loyalists among sunni extremists in yemen they are likely mid level aqap militants who are sympathetic to isil's vision but haven't broken ranks
according to some experts isis may be seeking a foothold in the middle east's poorest country because of its historical importance
yemen is significant in islam said katherine zimmerman a research fellow at the american enterprise institute
it is a place where we've seen attacks against the united states
it also has been a major feeder for foreign fighters into afghanistan into iraq and now into syria zimmerman added there's a recruiting pipeline that isis may try and tap into
the yemeni official who spoke to cnn said aqap is still the dominant terrorist presence in yemen with hundreds of members compared to dozens for isis
still he added there's a new kid on the block
as violence flares seven things to know about yemen
and isis may be using its financial strength to win over some of aqap's potential recruits
the yemeni official told cnn that isis supporters are telling potential recruits they can fund operations better than aqap can at the moment
u.s. officials have long expressed concerns about isis financial strength which it derives from the export of stolen oil ransom payments from hostages criminal activities and foreign donors
for this reason the u.s. treasury department has undertaken aggressive efforts to cut the group off from the international financial system
news of isis inroads in yemen comes as violence is rippling through the capital of sana'a where government troops are fighting houthi rebels that are taking control of government facilities
that violence is causing concern within the obama administration who count on the yemeni administration as key allies in the middle east
some institutions of government have broken down and are in trouble u.s. secretary of state john kerry conceded at a press conference on wednesday
still kerry emphasized that president abed rabbo mansour hadi remains in power and u.s. personnel are well protected
the yemeni official tells cnn his government has not noticed significant aqap movement in sana'a during this time which is he said surprising
but aqap's top leaders are still actively plotting the official said and still have ambitions of attacking the west
i think the target as we initially saw is going to be the europeans simply because of their ease to get onto the continent said kirk lippold former commander of the u.s.s
cole
but ultimately their aim is the united states
the u.s. intelligence community is actively working to track down aqap's leaders according to a u.s. counterterrorism official
these leaders include founder nasir al wuhayshi and notorious bombmaker ibrahim al asiri the mastermind of both the christmas day underwear bomb plot in two thousand and nine and a more recent attempt to put bombs in printer cartridges
nevertheless the yemeni official cautioned given the pressure aqap has been under in recent months is is now engaging more in its pre two thousand and eleven tactics of employing smaller cells and dispersed operatives
their main activities these days are targeted assassinations of houthis and yemeni government and military officials he added
but officials and analysts worry aqap and isis competition in yemen could create a dynamic wherein the groups compete to strike the u.s. first and hardest
it could lead an attack against the u.s. embassy in sa'ana which is vulnerable said zimmerman
and it could also direct its attention northward to saudi arabia

these are places to go locals say not no go zones as described by a fox news commentator as well as louisiana gov
bobby jindal
the last few weeks have seen characterizations of some european cities as inordinately full of muslims areas where a woman without a veil might feel too scared to explore areas that police largely avoid and where sharia law rules the day
this storyline has struck a nerve in place like the british city of birmingham and the belleville neighborhood of paris coming on the heels of terror attacks in france that killed seventeen and stirred worries around europe
it's left some angry dismissive or incredulous unsure of what to make of it all
who are these people they ask making sweeping damning assessments of their hometowns from thousands of miles away 
when i heard this frankly i choked on my porridge and i thought it was april fools day british prime minister david cameron told network itv referring specifically to fox news commentator steve emerson's remarks
this guy is clearly a complete idiot
the central english city of birmingham has a long and proud history from stone age era natives to roman conquerors to medieval markets and more
today the city is home to more than one million people who partly due to its universities are younger than england's overall population with forty five point seven percents under age thirty
birmingham is also relatively diverse with about forty two percents of its citizens being not white and twenty two percents born outside the country
in terms of religion just over forty six percents of residents are christian just under twenty two percents are muslim and about nineteen percents have no religion
it is not as emerson described it earlier this month
there are actually cities like birmingham that are totally muslim where non muslims simply don't go in
this assertion is wrong as emerson and fox later admitted
but that doesn't mean it didn't sting
britain's press association talked to several people in birmingham some of whom called such claims ridiculous others who dismissed them as misconceptions and one called it simply ignorant
we are not in cuckoo land raja mohammed ishtiaq co owner of the raja brothers market founded by pakistani immigrants told the guardian
there are lots of muslims here but this is a multicultural society and there are beautiful links between the different religions
how can they say this 
birmingham is one of the stable communities
some poked fun at the remarks on twitter with one claiming the british army
sent snow to make birmingham white again and another showing a picture of a bingo hall called mecca
joked one man
was a bit surprised that i had to convert to the muslim faith before they'd let me off the train at birmingham the other day
birmingham wasn't the only british city caught up in the controversy
so too was the capital london
emerson for one talked about no go zones around england
and during a speech in london jindal said that in the west non assimilationist muslims establish enclaves and carry out as much of sharia law as they can without regard for the laws of the democratic countries which provided them a new home
it is startling to think that any country would allow even unofficially for a so called no go zone he said
the idea that a free country would allow for specific areas of its country to operate in an autonomous way that is not free and is in direct opposition to its laws is hard to fathom
jindal later doubled down on the comments telling cnn's max foster that there are people here in london that will tell you there are neighborhoods where women don't feel safe
without veils and where police are less likely to go
a cnn crew went out to newham the london borough with the largest muslim population and found people who thought the republican governor's remarks were not based in reality
they said they felt safe and comfortable in a community that looked like many other parts of the city
this is not something we recognize at all marsh said
we don't have areas in london that are no go
we don't have areas in london that are sharia law only
and we police all areas of london
this debate unfolded hundreds of miles from the place that got the world talking about it in the first place
paris
that's where two islamist extremists stormed the offices of charlie hebdo magazine january seven leaving twelve dead
a policewoman in the paris suburb of montrouge was killed a day later
the next day the national nightmare climaxed in a pair of raids that killed three terrorists on top of the four civilians dead after a hostage siege at a kosher market in eastern paris
these events and their ties to an extreme twisted and violent form of islam made what's happening in france a talking point for commentators worldwide
some of that media buzz drew the ire of french nationals in particular fox news for emerson's comments and segments suggesting there are parts of paris and other european cities where islamic law is practiced and where police are fearful to work
paris mayor anne hidalgo went so far as to lay out plans to sue fox news for having insulted her city
the image of paris has been prejudiced she told cnn's christiane amanpour
and the honor of paris has been prejudiced
not everyone in france is rallying around charlie hebdo especially after it published a cartoon depicting the prophet mohammed after the attacks
teacher eric betencourt told cnn that many of his muslim students felt the magazine's staff had some responsibility for what happened saying they continued doing what they were doing in full knowledge of the risks
yet even if the entire country isn't on the same page when it comes to the satirical magazine that doesn't mean some places are isolated at least when it comes to police patrolling the streets or whether anyone including women without veils feel welcome on them
cnn's laura akhoun grew up in the paris neighborhood of belleville which has a large number of muslims and immigrants
she describes it as a lively place where rent is a little cheaper items at the market cost a little less and people feel welcome wherever they come from
people who are there now echo that view saying they feel safe comfortable and happy to live somewhere that people of all ethnicities and religions call home
it's no wonder then that some proud french nationals felt disgusted by the idea of outsiders casting aspersions on such neighborhoods as dangerous places
others fought back with humor as evidenced in a fake french news show le petit journal in which two men pretending to be fox news reporters are seen on the streets of paris
a graphic on the screen reads paris dangerous city
at one point one of the actors talks about getting in a taxi with a driver who had a muslim beard
oh my god he's a very dangerous islamist
he wants to kill us
a little later on one commentates as his fellow correspondent goes in and out of a turkish restaurant
john it's too dangerous
come back come back
run away run away the actor screams in seeming desperation
oh my god couscous
couscous is very dangerous
couscous in paris

called the open worm project the research brings together scientists and programmers from around the world with the aim of recreating the behavior of the common roundworm in a machine
the open source project recently had its first major breakthrough when its software modeled on the neurons of the worm's nervous system independently controlled a lego robot
the machine's sensors without any prior programming made the robot behave in a similar fashion to c. elegans approaching and backing away from obstacles or stimulated by food
while the developers say it will be some time before the lego bot will be avoiding predators or searching for a mate scientists say the project shows that artificial intelligence or ai as it is known is coming out of the realm of science fiction
we've been working on it for four years and while we have a lot more to achieve it's been the most surprising project i've been involved in project coordinator stephen larson told cnn
it's certainly exceeded my expectations
with the worm's nose neurons replaced by a sonar sensor and the motor neurons running down both sides of the worm replicated on the left and right motors of the lego bot the robot could emulate the worm's biological wiring
larson said that while the open source project is still awaiting peer review and the scientists and researchers in the experiment are reluctant to make any bold claims about how closely it resembled biological behavior the result were nevertheless impressive
we definitely have further to go but i think what captures people's imagination is how much information we have managed to put together larson said
we know we have the correct number of neurons we have them connected together in roughly the same way that the animal has and they're organized in the same way in that there are some neurons that give out information and other neurons that receive information
we feel we've gone a long way down the road but we still know that there's a lot that's been left out and there are a lot of assumptions at the moment it represents one point in a line of iterative improvements
i'd say we're only twenty to thirty percents of the way towards where we need to get
the project aims to digitally model the worm entirely in a virtual environment
creating a robot with an elastic body complete with stretchy muscles
something with wheels that is rigid is an interesting application but it still falls short of reproducing the anatomy of the worm larson said
he said the scientific road map is to model the worm completely equipping it with the same physics right down to the cells in all the right places
while the c. elegans nematode was chosen because of the simplicity of its biological structure the complexity of the experiment has been such that the team has had to narrow down the project to just a third of the worm's neurons restricting it to those parts of the worm's make up that would display behavior
the digital version of the worm will be released on the web in june this year allowing anyone with an interest to tinker with the project
larson said the open source and collaborative nature of the project has been key to its success allowing it to make fast progress over the four years of its existence
so far it's had input from more than sixty contributors from fifteen countries all of them bringing a unique take on the problems thrown up by the project
the project has now split into various sub teams all of them dealing with different elements
one team is looking at the physical and mechanical model while another is fleshing out the neurons and the muscles and their electrical models
the great part of the open source experiment is that the team can take onboard left field suggestions that push it beyond its boundaries
i'd say that this robot was just one of those left field suggestions larson said
a contributor was able to come along and re use our material put it up online
the fact that it caught so many people's attention was really a bit of a surprise
digital nose on a chip can sniff out cancer

the photo shows lutz bachmann leader of pegida which translates in english to patriotic europeans against the islamization of the west
it appeared wednesday on the cover of german tabloid bild
bachmann resigned as chairman of the group following the backlash to the hitler photo as well as another image bachmann posted of a man in a ku klux klan robe with the caption three k's a day keeps the minorities away
i apologize to everybody who has felt attacked by my online postings
they were comments made without serious reflection which i would no longer express today
i am sorry that i thereby damaged the interests of our movement and draw the appropriate conclusion bachmann said in dresden
the selfie was an act of satire his spokeswoman kathrin oertel said on facebook
while every citizen has the right to engage in satire she wrote insulting foreigners is not satirical
though bachmann apparently has deleted his own facebook account screen grabs published by numerous media outlets suggest bachmann posted the hitler photo in september while the kkk image is from two thousand and twelve
bachmann told bild i took the photo at the hairdressers for the publication of the audiobook of the satire he's back 

you need to be able to joke about things now and then
he's back or er ist wieder da in german is a two thousand and twelve best selling satire based on hitler waking up in modern day berlin with no knowledge of what happened following world war ii
the audiobook was released long before september as january two thousand and thirteen news reports indicate seventy five thousand copies had already been sold
it appears the images gained traction not because of timeliness but because pegida has successfully organized weekly anti islamization demonstrations in dresden
police estimated that eighteen thousand people attended a january five rally while about twenty five thousand people showed up at a january twelve rally
monday's scheduled protest in dresden was canceled after police persuaded pegida to call it off following an isis fatwa targeting pegida's organizers the group wrote on the facebook page for its united kingdom branch
the police has canceled the rally in agreement with pegida because they can't guarantee the security and safety of participants after information of planned attacks by islamistic groups the facebook post said
in response to monday's cancellation legida the city of leipzig's offshoot of pegida said it was organizing a rally expected to draw between thirty thousand and sixty thousand demonstrators according to german media
as many as four thousand police officers had been recruited from around the country in preparation for the event one news outlet reported
on its main facebook page which has more than one hundred and fifty five thousand likes pegida has stated its philosophy that citizens should wake from their slumber and recognize the danger in the islamic ideology
stop the radical salafists islamization it urges
as a society we should give people the chance to integrate but we should not allow ourselves to be islamized thereby losing our freedom and democracy
the group claims to have supporters in more than thirty german cities and eighteen countries in europe
a pegida group in norway also called for demonstrators to gather outside town hall in the capital oslo earlier this month to show support for the french and demonstrate opposition to what it calls the islamification of norway
german justice minister heiko maas and chancellor angela merkel have called on the group to cancel the rallies in dresden and other german cities
counterprotests have taken place or been planned in hanover dsseldorf hamburg munich dresden leipzig and berlin
during a january five demonstration germany's cologne cathedral turned off its lights in a symbolic rejection of the rally taking place in its shadow
joerg forbrig a european analyst with the german marshall fund of the united states told cnn that the pegida's message resonated only in the dresden area where its ideas had fallen on particularly fertile soil
these protests are not so much fueled by fear of islam and fear of islamist attacks but by frustration at the cost of reunification about the way they are being integrated and represented since the fall of the berlin wall forbrig said
dresden already had a well established network of right wing extremists before pegida's emergence he said
it's more a case of east germans not entirely feeling at home in germany forbrig said
there is a feeling of second class citizenship and in order to be heard many east germans take to radical measures


he lifts his long silver sword and strikes her neck a gasp then she falls silent
twice more the hangman hacks at her neck before stepping away to carefully wipe the blade
ambulance workers immediately start placing the woman's remains on a stretcher as charges against her are hurriedly read out over a loud speaker in the muslim holy city of mecca
she was accused of raping her seven year old stepdaughter with a broomstick and beating her to death
a royal decree was issued to carry out the sharia law in accordance with what is right the statement says
cell phone footage of the execution leaked last week by activists gives a rare glimpse into what human rights groups call a barbaric practice of public decapitation as a punitive measure handed down by saudi arabia's judicial system
the country executed eighty seven people in two thousand and fourteen most by beheading human rights watch told cnn
saudi officials told cnn the punishment is an integral part of their system of islamic law and the only violation that took place at the macabre scene was the illegal filming of the act
the man responsible for the recording now faces charges of violating the country's cyber laws and will be tried a saudi official not authorized to speak on the case said
we emphasize respect for the right to life as one of the fundamental rights guaranteed by the law
it should not make us forget the rights of other parties violated by the perpetrators which has to be seen with the same degree of respect mohammed al muadi of the government backed saudi human rights commission told cnn when asked specifically about the practice of beheading
the oil rich kingdom appears unyielding to international pressure but domestically a quiet debate is ongoing between hardline conservatives and more moderate members of the legal community experts tell cnn
abdulaziz algasim a former sharia law judge said
from a pure islamic law point of view there is no limitation for developing capital punishment
but he said that methods such as lethal injection may be considered in coming years
there is dialogue in the jurisprudence society that another alternative action can achieve the goal with more mercy and fit better with human rights
a project inaugurated by the ruling king abdullah to put laws into writing has ushered in a shift from the current uncodified system which provides judges with little guideline or precedence
this is all part of big issue of division
the sharia court led by conservatives wants to keep the regulation away from the influence of the political regime so they are very sensitive algasim says on the other side the modernization has to be achieved and it needs a lot of development in the public policy if you want to develop a way to measure punishment and establish a more humanized alternative

last friday's print edition of the sun was the last to feature a bare breasted woman ending one of british journalism's most controversial traditions after forty five years according to the times the tabloid's sister paper
the sun refused to confirm the report on tuesday
it's all speculation by people who don't work on the newspaper a spokesman told cnn
we regularly mix it up there's no hard and fast rule
despite the sun's denial the women featured on the third page of this week's editions have indeed covered up model rosie huntington whiteley posing in lingerie on monday and bikini clad soap opera stars frolicking on the beach on tuesday
an overhaul of the most infamous page in the country would be seen as the end of an era and a victory for critics who have derided page three as a sexist anachronism in a society that has moved on since one thousand nine hundred and seventy when rupert murdoch launched the feature shortly after purchasing the paper
stephanie rahn a twenty year old german supermodel was the first to strip off for the paper in november one thousand nine hundred and seventy
page three quickly became an institution and page three girl entered the british vernacular
the topless pics were credited by some for giving a boost to the sun's circulation figures as well as launching the careers of a number of glamor models over the years including melinda messenger samantha fox and katie price
but murdoch had come under increasing pressure since two thousand and twelve when the no more page three campaign whose slogan is boobs aren't news demanded that the sun's editors kill the page
the group's online petition has attracted more than two hundred and seventeen thousand signatures since its launch
murdoch the media tycoon who also owns twenty one st century fox seemed to indicate that change could be on the way when he branded page three old fashioned in a tweet last september
a spokeswoman for no more page three expressed delight about the rumors but said the sun needed to go even further
we're really pleased it's a definite step in the right direction laura ashton told cnn
it kind of depends a bit as well what they replace it with if it continues to be women in bikinis then it's still women being objectified and we don't really think there's any place for that in a national newspaper so the campaign will continue
ashton also had her own idea for what page three could feature in the future
i'd love to see a celebration of women the sun's in a really unique position here where they could turn things around after forty five years of giving us sexist images
they could celebrate women in sport or some other way in which women contribute to society
no more page three was launched by lucy ann holmes in the summer of two thousand and twelve after the writer and actress noticed that the largest female image in the sun newspaper was of a young woman showing her breasts for men even though jessica ennis had won her tremendous gold medal in the london olympics
although topless shots may no longer grace the paper's print edition the group's campaign is far from over
the tradition lives on at the sun's page three website and the daily star another british tabloid was still featuring naked models on page three as of tuesday

boko haram kidnapped german citizen robert nitsch eberhard in nigeria in july biya said in a statement read wednesday on state run broadcaster crtv
he did not detail how when or where the rescue operation took place
a special operation of cameroonian armed forces and security services of friendly countries freed the man he said
eberhard told journalists he was glad to be alive
i am happy to see all these people around me who have rescued me and made sure that i survived because until the last minute i did not know whether i would survive or i would not survive
it was for me a big problem
because it was darkness total darkness and you see nobody around you
then this is a big problem to say ok i will survive or not survive eberhard said
eberhard was flown in from cameroon's far north region to yaounde shortly after noon wednesday
he said he was grateful to all those who worked to secure his release
the german ambassador to cameroon klaus ludwig keferstein also thanked cameroonian authorities particularly because we could find a solution to this problem of hostage taking he said
eberhard spoke amid heavy security and mentioned that he was teaching at a vocational school in gombe adamawa state nigeria before the insurgents took him hostage in july
he has been taken to the residence of the german ambassador in yaounde
the ambassador said initial medical care will be given to him before he is flown back to germany for more medical attention
biya said he was thankful to all those who directly or indirectly helped in the achievement
and particularly the german government for their precious contribution
he did not specify how germany participated
the german foreign office did not immediately respond to cnn's request for comment
nkosazana dlamini zuma chairwoman of the african union commission praised the decision of president idriss deby itno of chad at the request of cameroon to deploy troops in that country to contribute to the ongoing operations against the boko haram terrorist group
boko haram which has fought an anti government campaign in northeastern nigeria and parts of cameroon said previously that it was holding a german hostage
boko haram leader abubakar shekau said so in november in a video message denying nigeria's claims that it had struck a ceasefire deal with the group
it wasn't immediately clear if this was eberhard
the operation came days after about two thousand chadian troops arrived in cameroon to help fight the insurgents
boko haram which means western education is forbidden in the local hausa dialect has terrorized northern nigeria regularly since two thousand and nine attacking police schools churches and civilians and bombing government buildings
it has kidnapped students including more than two hundred schoolgirls who were abducted in northeastern nigeria in april and remain missing
the islamist group has attacked neighboring cameroon initially by crossing the border from nigeria to steal food or kidnap foreign nationals
more recently the group went after cameroonian military installations
on sunday suspected boko haram militants kidnapped eighty people in cameroon's far north region officials in the country said
by monday a military operation had freed twenty four of the captives
three others were found dead state run media reported
boko haram has said its aim is to impose a stricter form of sharia law across nigeria which is split between a majority muslim north and a mostly christian south
biya has called for international cooperation in the fight against boko haram
last week the russian ambassador to cameroon nicolay ratsiborinski said his country will supply cameroon with modern and sophisticated military weapons including heavy artillery armored cars and missiles
michael stephen hoza u.s. ambassador to cameroon said the united states would help train cameroon soldiers and offer equipment for the fight

democracy freedom of religion and speech are gifts that help define what it means to be fully human
but within any democracy there must exist a level of respectful restraint when challenging or debating treasured religious values of the other
the islamic admonition of not depicting the prophet mohammed in any human image is a sacred element of islam
for anyone muslim or non muslim to do so is to disrespect and demean a basic tenant of the faith
what has happened tragically in france has provided other terrorists using religion as their selfish and feckless calling card with a motive to kill in the name of god
the end result of this latest slaughter is the construction of a global arena pitting freedom of speech against a time honored understanding of how to acknowledge the presence of the prophet mohammed in the world
those who bully abuse imprison and kill using religion as the rationale for their actions are neither religious nor faithful to their abrahamic roots
theirs is a desire to pit muslims christians and jews against one another in a religious war that will terminate years of hard won respectful interreligious dialogue between the three great abrahamic faiths
dialogue that has a place in creating a more peaceable and forgiving world
theirs is a desire to demean the genius of democracy freedom of speech and religion to create a false image of islam as a violent vengeful religion
nothing could be further from the truth
it is important to honor the lives lost in france and to remember that those murdered were jews christians and a muslim
terrorists kill not only for their own sick selfish motives but to create an environment where violence and hate will overwhelm peace and reconciliation between the faiths
they endeavor to show that democracy and freedom of speech have no place in their warped understanding of the islamic world
je suis charlie is a phrase shared by millions yet we all must understand that with freedom of speech must also come a sense of respectful restraint in criticizing or demeaning the personhood or values of another especially their religion during these tension filled times where sectarian violence is trying to rule the day
my anglican colleague and nobel laureate archbishop desmond tutu of south africa reminded me that the essence of being human is contained in the african word ubuntumeaning a person can only be a person through engagement with another i am because you are
we can only be fully human when we are bound by trust mutual respect and valuing the human dignity of another person
it is only by experiencing and embracing the other that we can be touched by the very hand of god made whole and made a new creation
it is only then that we can extend our reach beyond our grasp and begin to change the future of humanity in a culture of peace
at this moment in time christianity islam and judaism have a great opportunity to work together effectively with governments and civil societies currently in turmoil
the abrahamic faiths have the opportunity to re shape the world into a culture of peace rather than a world torn asunder by violence extremism and political pilfering
christianity islam and judaism must become the bridge builders of this century to span the raging waters of human conflict
it is pure heresy that has given birth to human behavior sustained by fear and hate rather than by love of god love of self and love of neighbor
it is this heresy that takes the unconditional love of god for all human beings hijacks it and shreds it into pieces of human interpretation that bear no resemblance to the core teachings of the one god of christianity islam and judaism as we know them
no person has the right to take the life of another person in the name of god
human beings who claim to represent the true teachings of christianity islam and judaism and who indiscriminately slaughter those who are the other have lost the most fundamental principle of their religious tradition's theology
they have lost the core of a compassionate and loving god
there is no fear in love but perfect love casts out fear
for fear has to do with punishment
and whoever fears has not reached perfection in love
those who say
i love god and hate their brothers and sisters who they have seen can not love god who they have not seen
the commandment that we have from him is this
those who love god must love their brothers and sisters
rabbi jonathan sacks wrote
i believe that we are being summoned by god to see in the human other a face of the divine other 
the test so lamentably failed by the great powers of the twenty th century is to see the divine presence in the face of the stranger
to heed the cry of those who are disempowered in the age of unprecedented powers
who are hungry and poor and ignorant and uneducated whose human potential is being denied the chance to be expressed
that is the faith of abraham and sarah who with the great faiths judaism christianity and islam trace their spiritual or actual ancestry
war sectarian violence and terrorism are definitions of human failure
for all who follow the teachings of the prophets jesus and mohammed who will now stand firm and commit themselves to end all acts of violence and extremism done in the name of god 
if not us then who 

while these cases are extremely rare it does beg the question of why gaming can lead to such excessive behavior
i have spent nearly three decades studying videogame addiction and there are many studies published in both the medical and psychological literature showing that very excessive gaming can lead to a variety of health problems that range from repetitive strain injuries and obesity through to auditory and visual hallucinations and addiction
i have to stress that there is lots of scientific research showing the many educational and therapeutic benefits of playing but there is definitely a small minority of gamers that develop problems as a result of gaming overuse
but what is it that makes gaming so compulsive and addictive for the small minority 
for me addiction boils down to constant reinforcement or put more simply being constantly rewarded while playing the game
gaming rewards can be physiological psychological social and in some cases financial
most of these rewards are at least to some extent unpredictable
not knowing when the next reward will come keeps some players in the game
in short they carry on gaming even though they may not have received an immediate reward
they simply hope that another reward is just around the corner and keep on playing
added to this is the shift over the last decade from standalone console gaming to massively multiplayer online games where games never end and gamers have to compete and or collaborate with other gamers in real time
many excessive gamers report that they hate logging off and leaving such games
they don't like it as they don't know what is going on in the game when they are not online
the last five years has seen large increase in the number of scientific studies on problematic gaming
in may two thousand and thirteen the american psychiatric association published the fifth edition of the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders
for the first time the dsm five included internet gaming disorder as a psychological condition that warrants future research
throughout my research career i have argued that although all addictions have particular and idiosyncratic characteristics they share more commonalities than differences such as total preoccupation mood modification cravings tolerance withdrawal symptoms conflict with work education and other people and loss of control
these similarities likely reflect a common etiology of addictive behavior
so when does a healthy enthusiasm turn into an addiction 
at the simplest level healthy enthusiasms add to life and addictions take away from it
but how much is too much 
this is difficult to answer as i know many gamers who play many hours every day without any detrimental effects
the dsm five lists nine criteria for igd
if any gamer endorses five or more of the following criteria they would likely be diagnosed as having igd
preoccupation with internet games
withdrawal symptoms when internet gaming is taken away
the need to spend increasing amounts of time engaged in internet gaming unsuccessful attempts to control participation in internet gaming
loss of interest in hobbies and entertainment as a result of and with the exception of internet gaming
continued excessive use of internet games despite knowledge of psychosocial problems
deception of family members therapists or others regarding the amount of internet gaming
use of the internet gaming to escape or relieve a negative mood
and loss of a significant relationship job or educational or career opportunity because of participation in internet games
the good news is that only a small minority of gamers suffer form igd
most online games are fun and exciting to play
but like any activity that is taken to excess in a minority of cases the activity can become addictive
any activity if done for days on end could lead to severe health problems and even death and gaming is no exception
instead of demonizing games we need to educate gamers about the potential dangers of very excessive use

unfortunately even with the hardships of living in a camp these kids are still some of the lucky ones
after all at least half of syrian refugee children aren't even in school
indeed if syrian refugees were a country they would have the lowest rate of educational enrollment in the world
and without access to quality education children here are at risk of not having the skills they need as adults
all this means that syria is facing a lost generation
why is all this happening 
because the civil war is destroying syrian society
the united nations announced earlier this month that syrians are now the largest refugee population in the world more than seven point five million syrians are displaced internally while another three point two million are registered refugees in neighboring countries
that's nearly half of syria's total population
and while lebanon turkey jordan iraq and egypt have been remarkably generous hosts the influx is so large that it's changing some countries demographics with refugees comprising at least twenty percents of lebanon's population ten percents of jordan's and ten to twenty percents of border areas in turkey according to the state department and u.n
meanwhile more than eighty percents of the refugees reside in urban areas not camps and so rely on urban services placing high demands on schools
all this is leaving education in crisis across the host countries
while each country officially allows syrian children access to the public education system barriers remain including school space shortages having to learn new languages transportation the need for children to work for their family's survival and bullying
in addition many are putting off school in the belief that their return to syria is imminent
this creates very real risks to the quality of education for both host country nationals and syrian children
the presence of refugees has meant crowded classrooms and constrained budgets and it leaves teachers managing students who are at different levels
continuous investment in these countries education systems is therefore important so that the quality of education doesn't fall backwards
sadly there's no end in sight for syria's civil war
and even when peace is re established it will take years before many syrians can return to their homes given the destroyed infrastructure and residual tensions within society
this isn't unique to the current situation
in protracted refugee crises around the world the average time until refugees can return home is seventeen years according to the united nations
the responsibility for providing formal k twelve education for refugees lies primarily with the host governments some of which are taking loans to cover the deficits
but while much of the international assistance response has so far been humanitarian responding to urgent needs what's needed now is a transition toward development planning in which longer term sustainable solutions for education and other sectors are planned and resourced
this means investing in building capacities of host country governments to provide education to these additional people in the future
donor funding will dry up over time and the host governments will need systems to manage the additional children they must educate
moving forward host countries and the international aid community should prioritize investment in access to quality education with additional attention to building infrastructure to expand school spaces understanding and addressing other barriers to access developing transportation options improving data systems expanding school monitoring and support and providing teacher training about refugee needs in the classroom
this will also constitute an investment in the longer term education development needs of the host countries meaning they'll benefit too
the suffering that has taken place in syria since the civil war started in two thousand and eleven has been almost unimaginable
but by investing in the country's future in this way the international community can help ensure education isn't another casualty of the war
and perhaps help lay the foundations for a brighter future

time is running out
isis put out a video tuesday giving the japanese government seventy two hours to pay two hundred million dollar or else kenji goto and haruna yukawa like other isis captives before them will be killed
japanese chief cabinet secretary yoshihide suga said wednesday that his government estimates the deadline will come at two fifty p.m. friday tokyo time
until then he said japanese officials are trying to save them
suga said his government will do its utmost to communicate with isis on the fate of goto and yukawa through a third party such as another nation's government or a local tribe
he didn't say whether japan would be willing to pay any ransom
absent such a private back and forth the japanese official voiced his government's stance publicly including its defense of a proposed aid package also tabbed at two hundred million dollar to help those who are contending with isis according to prime minister shinzo abe
abe has defended the aid package as needed to build up human capacities infrastructure and so on yet isis denounced it anyway in its recent video
japan's measures are absolutely not intending to kill muslim people unlike what the hostage takers claim suga said wednesday
we strongly urge them not to harm the two japanese nationals and immediately release them
goto and yukawa were last seen months ago disappearing in the same part of the world
while they had different professions the two knew and talked to each other said yukawa's friend nobuo kimoto
it was january two thousand and fourteen when kimoto met yukawa who told him about his dream of providing security for japanese ships in dangerous areas such as waters off somalia sometimes plagued by pirates
three months later yukawa headed off to syria to gain combat and survival experience kimoto said
there yukawa met the man isis refers to as kenji goto jogo
goto is a freelance journalist who has worked for various japanese news organizations including reporting about the northern syrian battleground city of kobani which for weeks has been under siege by isis and other areas
goto gave yukawa insights on how to survive there kimoto said
he also introduced him to rebel fighters distinct from isis even though both were fighting against syrian president bashar al assad's forces some of whom talked about their need for ambulances to shuttle the injured
that plea spurred yukawa to start raising money for this cause after returning to japan according to his friend kimoto
i felt a chill when he said after returning home he felt in syria he was really living a life kimoto said
he seems to have felt satisfaction being there and living together with the locals
he went back to syria in july a trip that kimoto said he didn't know about at the time
kimoto said he had advised yukawa to focus on building up his private military company which provided armed security services and posted videos online of his activities in iraq and syria
yukawa forty two went missing and was captured sometime after that
goto met the same fate
while it's not known exactly when he became a hostage his last twitter post was on october twenty three
alaaeddin al zaim worked as a fixer for goto
speaking to cnn in turkey he said the journalist had reached out to him about going into isis controlled territory
i am not american i am not british
i'm japanese
i can go goto told the fixer
fixers help reporters travel and connect with local contacts
al zaim refused believing the trip was too dangerous
another fixer agreed to take goto to isis al zaim said
before he left goto made a short video which cnn saw in which he explained his decision to travel was his and his alone
goto gave al zaim his phones and a list of numbers
he gave me this and asked me to call japanese wife his wife in japan his friends in japan
after one week if i don't hear any news of them or any connection i have to call them said al zaim who remembers seeing goto for the last time on october twenty five
after a week he said he hadn't heard from goto and so he made the call to his wife
al zaim who described goto as his brother praised his reporting work
he is the best journalist i met him and i work with him because he like military stories
he covered every time civilian and kids stories in syria
and also he is very strong
anytime he want to do his job very well
sometimes we are going to danger places he afraid
he tell me
this is my job
i am journalist
i have to do that 
cnn could not immediately confirm the details of what al zaim said
what happens next for both men is up to isis
unfortunately it doesn't have a record of showing much mercy
the islamist militant group has been behind mass killings and kidnappings during its years long campaign to take over vast swaths of iraq and syria attempting to justify its actions like enslaving and having sex with young girls as somehow consistent with its extreme conservative faith
taking hostages from outside countries has been part of its playbook
not only has isis beheaded many of them but it's made a show of it by recording their deaths and showing them online as propaganda something that began in august with the killing of u.s. journalist james foley
those beheaded hostages were american and british both from countries involved in a military campaign against isis
japan is allies with both though it is not participating in any airstrikes or the training or outfitting of those fighting the militant group
tokyo's stance on the conflict including the two hundred million dollar pledge that abe made sunday was apparently enough to draw the ire of the group that calls itself the islamic state
although you are more than eight thousand five hundred kilometers away from the islamic state you willingly volunteered to take part in this crusade said the masked man who stood over goto and yukawa in tuesday's video addressing his comments to abe
abe has responded by defending the proposed aid and blasting isis threat against two of his nation's citizens as unacceptable
i feel angry about it he said tuesday
i strongly urge them to immediately release the hostages without harming them

valls said close to three thousand people in france with jihadist ties needed to be under surveillance and that the number of people with links to networks in iraq and syria had increased by one hundred and thirty percents in the past year
in response to the threat two thousand six hundred and eighty new jobs will be created of which intelligence services alone will account for one thousand one hundred he said
many of the new jobs will be dedicated to tackling the threat from online jihadism
france will allocate four hundred and twenty five million euros over the next three years to boost the fight against extremism valls said
these resources will be used to buy new equipment such as bulletproof vests and better weapons for police officers
valls also said a new bill would be presented in april aimed at reinforcing the intelligence services legal position in conducting surveillance
efforts for early detection of radicalization will be enhanced within the justice ministry he said
people charged with or convicted of acts of terrorism will be placed on a list and required to report trips abroad or changes of address
other measures are aimed at preventing radicalization in prisons and online
internet companies and social networks will be expected to cooperate closely with authorities valls said
the prime minister also detailed the consequences for those who attack the nation which may include removal from french territory for radical islamists or loss of french citizenship
the latter measure will need to be validated by the constitutional council on friday
the costs of the new anti terrorism provisions will be met through savings in other areas of public spending valls said
through these measures he concluded the government was sending a message of relentless determination to the french people
valls announcement comes as europe ramps up efforts against islamist extremism in the wake of the paris attacks
the attacks this month against the satirical charlie hebdo magazine and a kosher supermarket have turned the spotlight on links between radical islamists in europe and terror networks elsewhere
al qaeda's yemen affiliate al qaeda in the arabian peninsula has claimed to be behind the january seven massacre by gunmen said and cherif kouachi at the offices of charlie hebdo
and gunman amedy coulibaly who attacked the kosher grocery store on january nine proclaimed his allegiance to the islamic state in iraq and syria or isis
the suspects in the paris attacks may have urged their associates to leave france before the plot was carried out law enforcement sources told cnn
european authorities are concerned that about half a dozen people with ties to the terror suspects are believed to be in syria and could return to europe to launch more attacks the sources said
a western official added the recent arrests across europe are similar to the hyper reactivity after nine eleven in the united states
we've become hyper reactive to any suggestion of islamic extremism and are chasing a lot of ghosts out of an excess of caution the official said
some are legitimate and some are not
from antwerp to aleppo and back
europe's nightmare
in a video released this week a senior aqap leader and spokesman urged all would be jihadists to wage war at home when possible as opposed to traveling abroad
if he is capable to wage individual jihad in the western countries that fight islam such as america britain france canada and others of the countries that represent the head of disbelief in waging war against islam
if he is capable of that then that is better and more harmful said nasr ibn ali al ansi
he continued
but if that is impossible and he is able to serve his brothers on the front lines then let him immigrate for it is better
an off camera interviewer asked why attacks have abated in the united states
by the grace of allah the great the almighty we have made efforts in external work and the enemy knows the danger of that al ansi said
we are preparing and lurking for the enemies of allah
we incite the believers to do that
paris prosecutor franois molins told a news conference that progress has been made in the investigation into the attack carried out by coulibaly but less so in the probe into the kouachi brothers
molins identified four suspects still in custody as willy p. christophe r. tonino g. and michael a. giving only the first initial of their last names and outlined details of the charges against them
none of the four men has been charged with complicity in the kosher market attack
the first three willy p. christophe r. and tonino g. were present when coulibaly bought the renault car that he used to reach the site of the attack
it was found parked near the porte de vincennes after the attack
the fingerprints of the fourth suspect named as michael a. were found on one of the weapons that police discovered in coulibaly's secret apartment in gentilly authorities say
his dna was also found on a glove discovered at the scene of the crime the prosecutor says
in the days leading up to the attack michael a. had exchanged three hundred and sixty two text messages and eighteen phone calls with coulibaly the prosecutor says
the two men met on january five four days before coulibaly's attack
the four men in custody all in their twenty s were among nine people arrested in a police operation friday
five other suspects held since friday were released monday night
amid heightened concern over the threat posed by radical islamists in europe belgium and germany have cracked down on alleged extremists in recent days
belgian authorities continue the hunt for the ringleader behind a terrorist cell targeted in countrywide raids last week in which two suspects died
the suspected key link between senior isis operatives in syria and the belgian terrorist cell belgian moroccan isis fighter abdelhamid abaaoud is still at large a senior belgian counterterrorism official said monday
his last known location was greece the official said
one line of inquiry being looked at is whether abaaoud tried to fake his own death last year while fighting with isis in syria so that he could disappear off the radar screen of western intelligence services
in october his family in brussels received word he had been martyred his sister told a belgian newspaper
belgian investigators believe abaaoud rather than dying on the front lines traveled to greece and suspect he was communicating by phone from there with the terrorist cell in belgium
despite an international manhunt involving both american and european intelligence agencies abaaoud remains at large
the concern is he will return to syria before he can found
the belgian prosecutor's office meanwhile said wednesday that custody had been extended for three suspects arrested in last thursday's raids
all three are charged with participation at the activities of a terrorist group and violation of weapons laws
one is also charged with armed rebellion in a group with premeditation
that last is marouan el bali who survived the police raid in verviers in which two suspects died
his attorney said he was not involved in terrorism but was simply in the wrong place at the wrong time
the greek authorities have also agreed to the extradition of an algerian suspect named as omar s. the belgian prosecutor's office said
the extradition could take place in the following days
when he arrives in belgium he will be brought before the investigating judge who will decide on an arrest warrant the prosecutor's office said
another suspect named as abdelmounaim h was arrested tuesday and charged with participation in the activities of a terrorist group
he's due to appear before a brussels court on friday the prosecutor's office said
federal prosecutor eric van der sypt said last week that the alleged terror cell targeted in the countrywide raids was on the brink of an attack and planned to target police officers
meanwhile police in berlin brandenburg and thuringen raided thirteen properties linked to suspected radical islamists overnight monday to tuesday
the raids are part of the investigation into two alleged islamists who were arrested friday identified as ismet d. and emin f. berlin police said
both of them are accused of providing logistical aid to isis
those subject to the raids have not yet been accused of any crimes but had contact with ismet d. and emin f. there are no indications that the group was preparing attacks in germany
coulibaly killed four hostages at the kosher grocery store in paris before police killed him
he's also believed to have killed a policewoman a day earlier
new surveillance video obtained by cnn purportedly shows coulibaly and hayat boumedienne believed currently to be in syria outside a jewish institution in paris
a source familiar with the ongoing investigation into the paris attacks says there is a high degree of confidence that the video shows coulibaly and boumedienne
the video was recorded at the end of august or beginning of september and stored on a security camera
the source says the nature of the video makes it clear that the couple were carrying out surveillance of possible targets for months before coulibaly launched his attack against the kosher supermarket
the video was stored because it showed possible signs of unusual activity at the location says the source

almost two thousand years later researchers may be on the brink of reading some of the charred scrolls damaged in the eruption
the scrolls which were buried in a herculaneum library and excavated two hundred and sixty years ago are easily damaged or destroyed by unwrapping so researchers have been unable to read them without risk
but by using x ray phase contrast tomography a three d technique used in medicine for soft biological tissue they have been able to reveal writing on the tightly wrapped scrolls without unrolling them wrote a team led by vito mocella of the naples based institute for microelectronics and microsystems of the national council of research
their research was described in the journal nature communications
this attempt opens up new opportunities to read many herculaneum papyri which are still rolled up thus enhancing our knowledge of ancient greek literature and philosophy they wrote
the herculaneum library which was uncovered in the one thousand seven hundred and fifty s is the only ancient library to survive with its books the researchers point out
the scrolls are primarily philosophical texts
the team looked at two scrolls given to napoleon in one thousand eight hundred and two burnt by volcanic gases reaching about six hundred degrees fahrenheit and were able to discern a handful of greek letters through the x ray technology
though difficult to make out the letters are there in relief because the ink is still on the top mocella told the bbc
there's still a long way to go to completely read the texts of the scrolls but scholars are optimistic
one of them the university of michigan's richard janko told the new york times we might find works thought lost to history
this technology when perfected does open the way to rediscovering a lot more ancient literature he said

the french government decided to award citizenship to the malian born twenty four year old supermarket employee after he risked his own life to hide customers from hostage taker amedy coulibaly earlier this month
four people lost their lives in the hostage taking and shooting at the kosher grocery store
but the fifteen people whom bathily led downstairs to hide in a walk in freezer stayed safe
bathily who describes himself as a practicing muslim told cnn affiliate bfmtv he switched off the freezer turned off the lights and told everyone to stay calm
he went upstairs following orders from the hostage taker but managed to run outside and tell police about the situation in the store
in his opening speech at the ceremony tuesday evening cazeneuve praised bathily's gesture of courage and humanity which had become the symbol of an islam of peace and tolerance
bathily who arrived in france when he was sixteen had dreamed of gaining french citizenship since his childhood
today this dream is becoming true a bit faster than expected cazeneuve said
valls also paid tribute to the courage of the young man
with you and with all the people in this room the prime minister said we just saw one of the most beautiful images of our country
valls also recalled the strong ties between france and mali a country which saw timbuktu being wrecked by terrorists and which received french support in its fight against jihadism
the french military has been involved in fighting islamist extremists in mali and the wider sahel region since early two thousand and thirteen
both valls and cazeneuve emphasized the importance of keeping french citizenship open in order to remain faithful to the republican ideal
welcoming new french citizens is an opportunity for the country as well as for those who become french valls said
bathily then took the floor
i thank you with all my heart for awarding me french citizenship
i am proud and moved the young man said
people think i am a hero but i am not
i am just lassana
at the end of the ceremony bathily received his passport together with a letter from president francois hollande and the citizenship kit distributed to all new french citizens
coulibaly the terrorist killed in the police operation that ended the supermarket attack also had roots in mali
but unlike bathily he was born in france and had french citizenship


the terrorist explained that they would be executed in seventy two hours if isis isn't paid two hundred million dollar
japanese prime minister shinzo abe responded on tuesday saying the treatment of the hostages was unacceptable
isis had similarly demanded one hundred million euros in ransom for the release of james foley the american journalist who was killed by the terrorist group in syria in august
like the two hundred million dollar demand for the japanese hostages the foley demand was never a serious negotiation effort as it far exceeded the amounts of money paid for hostages held by jihadist militant groups in the past which typically have ranged up to several million dollars
but the demand does shine a light on two uncomfortable facts about kidnap and ransom or kandr the dark netherworld of professionals who work to negotiate between murderous groups such as isis and the terrified families whose loved ones have been kidnapped
it also includes their worried employers and western governments such as france that will pay ransoms and other governments notably the united states and the united kingdom that will not
the first uncomfortable fact is that if you pay a ransom a hostage is more likely to be released
the other is that every time a ransom is paid it increases the chance that other hostages will be taken to help fill the coffers of a terrorist group
according to an investigation by the new york times al qaeda and its affiliates have netted at least one hundred and twenty five million dollar in ransoms since two thousand and eight
that finding is similar to a two thousand and twelve u.s. treasury estimate that one hundred and twenty million dollar had been paid to terrorist organizations during the previous eight years
much of this revenue reportedly comes from france
french media reported that the government had paid twenty million euros for the release of four employees of a french nuclear firm
they were held by an al qaeda affiliate for three years in northern niger and were released last year
the french government denied paying a ransom but the new york times indicated based on reports from le monde and agence france presse that france did pay in that case and has paid out a total of some fifty eight million dollar to al qaeda or related groups
opinion
why countries should think about paying ransoms
not surprisingly the times also found that of the fifty three hostages known to have been taken by al qaeda and its affiliates during the past five years a third were french
the french government's purported policy of negotiating with militant groups for the release of kidnapped citizens does appear to work
four french journalists nicolas henin pierre torres edouard elias and didier franois who were kidnapped in syria last year by isis were released near the turkish border in april blindfolded and with their hands bound
one of those hostages henin had been held by isis alongside foley
henin is free and foley is dead
these are the facts that policymakers must confront as they consider what to do about the other western hostages still held by isis
so far isis has executed a number of western hostages including american journalist steven sotloff and u.s. aid worker peter kassig
isis continues to holds one american female aid worker
cnn is withholding her name
for the hostages held by isis there is always the chance that their governments will mount a rescue operation as the united states did in syria in july two thousand and fourteen to try and rescue foley and the other americans
that mission failed because the hostages had been moved from a location they had been kept in for some months
there is also the possibility that hostages could escape as american photographer matthew schrier did last year when he managed to crawl out of a window of the prison where he was being held in in the syrian city of aleppo by an islamist militant group
but such escapes are rare and while successful rescue efforts do happen they are fraught with risks for the hostages
linda norgrove for instance a british aid worker held by the taliban in afghanistan in two thousand and ten was killed in a u.s. rescue operation likely by a grenade that exploded near her
if there's not an escape or a successful rescue effort western governments whose citizens are held by isis have only the options of either a negotiation involving ransom or the real possibility that their hostages may be executed
this is the sobering choice that has faced president barack obama and his national security advisers and now faces the japanese prime minister
last year obama ordered a review of u.s. hostage policy which is never to negotiate with terrorists
the review is reportedly supposed to examine issues such as family engagement intelligence collection and diplomatic engagement policies
but that seems to be rather missing the point
the real issue is
will a ransom be paid or not 
an area of possible wiggle room would be to leave the door open so that ransoms for americans could be allowed to be paid not with u.s. government funds but with private donations
in such a case the government would simply look the other way when private donations were used to free an american hostage as paying money to a designated terrorist organization is a crime in the states
this is the least bad solution to a terrible quandary which is if that if you don't pay the ransom the hostage dies and if you do pay the ransom you are helping a terrorist organization

she was stabbed in the head
go to hamasger street the caller shouted
a man stabbed nine people including the driver of a bus and passengers on wednesday in what police are calling a terror attack
the girl was she conscious 
the nine hundred and eleven operator asked
yes yes she is crying she is conscious the caller answered
the attacker was a twenty three year old palestinian from the west bank city of tulkarem authorities said
police shot him in the leg after he got off the bus
he was arrested and is being questioned they said
the suspect was identified as hamzeh matrouk said israeli authorities and the suspect's family
his uncle ahmad matrouk said his nephew lives with his mother in the west bank city of ramallah
the suspect's father lives in another west bank city tulkarem where the uncle was interviewed by cnn
hamzeh has no political affiliation the uncle said
we were called by the israeli military to come in for questioning
his father mother and myself we went and they were asking us about his political affiliation
we said that hamzeh never had any political affiliation
when asked what could be a motive for the suspect's attack the uncle said it was because of what he sees of suffering of the palestinians by israel
the daily attacks by the extremist jews and israelis on the aqsa mosque and especially this summer the killing of more than two thousand one hundred palestinians by israel in gaza
the suspect works as an electrician supporting his mother and his younger brothers the uncle said
he came to see his father last night and his friends last night and he was in his nature nothing suspicious the uncle said
the uncle said his nephew born in late one thousand nine hundred and ninety two was age twenty two not twenty three as authorities reported
israeli authorities couldn't be immediately reached for comment to clarify the suspect's age but a government website stated the suspect was born in one thousand nine hundred and ninety two was originally from tulkarem and had no prior arrests
witnesses and police say that when the attacker boarded the bus and stabbed the driver and a few passengers the driver tried to fight back by spraying the assailant with pepper spray veering the bus pumping the brakes and opening the doors
some passengers were able to get out and get away
the attacker ran after them and stabbed a few people on his way out of the bus
prison guards who were in their car behind the bus got out of their vehicle and chased the assailant witnesses and police said
the attacker was shot in the leg and apprehended
four victims were seriously wounded according to emergency responders
five people were either lightly or moderately injured emergency services said
several other passengers were treated for shock
one person was severely injured officials told cnn and the attacker remains in moderate condition at a tel aviv hospital
the terror of the victims and the chaos during the attack was captured in other nine hundred and eleven calls
an injured woman can be heard telling an operator my body is covered with blood
in a separate call another woman says i have here a wounded man who is heavily bleeding someone has to come for help he is bleeding from the head from his neck that is what i see
the operator tells her to find a clean piece of cloth and press it against the man's wounds
a hamas spokesman izzat al risheq who is based in qatar praised the attack according to the times of israel and haaretz
the heroic stabbing incident against the zionist in tel aviv is a daring and heroic act he reportedly said
it comes as a natural response to the terrorist occupation crimes against our people
israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu fired back casting a net of blame around hamas and the palestinian authority which together form a unity government
the terrorist attack in tel aviv is the direct result of the poisonous incitement being disseminated by the palestinian authority against the jews and their state
this same terrorism is trying to attack us in paris brussels and everywhere
the u.s. embassy in israel on its website said that due to security concerns on israel's northern border all u.s. government personnel must get advance approval to travel within one point five miles of the lebanese border or east of route ninety eight in the golan heights
and it said in light of the bus attack u.s. government employees are prohibited from using public buses throughout israel and the west bank
there has been a string of attacks against israeli residents in recent months
here is a look at a few of them
a palestinian man threw acid on an israeli family near a jerusalem checkpoint in december israeli authorities said
a teenage palestinian girl with a knife stabbed an israeli man in the west bank israeli police said
two palestinian cousins stormed a jerusalem synagogue in mid november with a gun and butcher's knives killing five
they were shot dead by police
days later israeli authorities said they foiled a plot by palestinians to assassinate israeli foreign minister avigdor lieberman
more than a week earlier attackers stabbed one israeli soldier to death in tel aviv and three more israelis near a west bank settlement the idf said
one of the west bank victims also died
in early november a palestinian man driving a van plowed into pedestrians at a train stop in eastern jerusalem killing two
another twelve people were injured
the man died in police gunfire after also attacking people with a metal bar police said
in october a palestinian man rammed his car into commuters waiting at a light rail stop in jerusalem killing a baby and wounding several other people israeli police said
the driver of the vehicle was shot as he tried to flee and later died
also in october according to a palestinian state news report an israeli man killed a five year old palestinian girl when he ran her down in a car as she walked home from kindergarten
the attack reportedly also injured a second five year old girl

the rebels have agreed to release the president's chief of staff and withdraw their militias from key government institutions if officials take a significant step
rewriting parts of the country's constitution according to a yemeni official with access to a draft text of the peace deal
under the terms of the agreement the government will accept changes in the draft of the new constitution that would grant the houthis more political power
word of the deal still leaves many questions unanswered
what could the reshaped constitution look like 
how much power will the rebels get 
and how much control will president abdu rabu mansour hadi have 
houthi rebels shiite muslims who have long felt marginalized in the majority sunni country abducted the president's chief of staff over the weekend then took over the presidential palace in sanaa on tuesday
one government minister called it the completion of a coup but rebels said they had not asked the president to step down
the chaos in yemen is cause for concern far beyond the country's borders
for the united states and its allies yemen's government has been a key ally in the fight against al qaeda in the arabian peninsula the yemen based group linked to attacks such as the recent slaughter at french magazine charlie hebdo
aqap also tried to blow up a plane landing in detroit in two thousand and nine
isis is also recruiting in yemen to expand its ranks
and questions over who's in charge over the past few days have sparked concerns that a power vacuum could help terrorist groups get a stronger foothold
but the deal inked wednesday could signal a return to stability said mohammed albasha a spokesman for the yemeni embassy in washington
the situation is fluid
it's critical
the government was paralyzed
parts of the government dysfunctional but we did not reach the point of no return he told cnn's the situation room
things are difficult but there are things that are moving forward
several of the constitutional changes sought by the houthis would emphasize the characteristics of yemen as a federal state and push for more inclusion of diverse groups
the houthis call for marginalized political groups to have the right to partnerships in state institutions and fair representation according to the text of the tentative agreement
in return for these government concessions the rebels basically agree to withdraw their fighters from the capital
the rebels control or have blockaded several government installations
the presidential palace the presidential residence the prime minister's residence and a military installation where missiles are housed
under the agreement the houthis would withdraw from all of these sites
the rebels would cooperate with the government so that the president and state institutions can return to their duties and would urge all state employees to return to their jobs
a houthi official said the rebels will abide by the deal if the president follows a timeline specified in the negotiations
this deal draws the road map for the political process going forward with the participation of all factions in yemen
in the past timelines were not respected who hope this time will be different a member of the houthi political council said
this isn't the first time the rebels and the government have hammered out an agreement
houthis swept into the capital last year sparking battles that left more than three hundred dead in a month
in september they signed a ceasefire deal with the government and houthis have since installed themselves in key positions in the government and financial institutions
like them or not albasha said the houthis aren't going anywhere and are part of the yemeni political structure
they are now a fact of life
they are now a dominant force in many of the northern provinces he said
we're going to have to coexist and live with them
for days the answers to questions about who's in charge of the country have varied depending on who you ask
even as rebel militiamen stepped up their presence outside the presidential palace a yemeni official told cnn the president does not consider himself a captive
the official said the houthis were assisting hadi's security detail in their protection mission because part of the detail had run away yesterday because of the fighting
a senior leader of the houthi resistance movement abdullah shabaan gave a similar account
he told cnn that the president's personal security left him which forced us to gather hundreds of fighters from our security to ensure he is safe
summarizing the actual balance of power the official said the houthis demands were clear and nobody can hide that they are the dominant force but they still recognize government power
besides the confusion about who is at the helm in yemen the rebels seized military installations it says it will return under the agreement
two houthi field commanders told cnn that rebels had seized control of a massive weapons depot belonging to the government brigade that provides presidential personal security
the houthis had control of two hundred and eighty t eighty russian made tanks and other heavy artillery the field commanders said
while most of the security forces reportedly fled after a light clash with militants the houthis said they captured at least twelve special forces soldiers
on wednesday houthi rebels surrounded a yemeni missile brigade in attan a suburb east of sanaa
the installation is not under control of the rebels but they have it surrounded the field commanders and two government officials said
the houthis said their objective is not to take over the missile brigade but to keep missiles from being moved elsewhere
seven things to know about yemen

yet we know what needs to be done for example to end the ebola disaster halt climate change rid our world of hunger and begin the difficult process of healing deep divisions in our societies
our failure is not because of a lack of knowledge or global resources but leadership and resolve by politicians but also throughout society
how we put this right must be at the heart of all discussions at davos this week
let's start with ebola
we have known about this disease for forty years how deadly it is how it is transmitted and how to prevent infection
yet we have lost thousands of lives already to the epidemic in west africa and only now have the resources from within countries and outside been mobilized to halt it
we need to learn the lessons and ensure we can move much more quickly and effectively before such deadly diseases take hold
the last few months have also underlined the need for big pharma to invest more into the research of diseases that occur in poorer countries
the extraordinary progress in tackling some of the world's greatest killers through the development and distribution of vaccines shows what can be achieved through our collective efforts
second africa with the world's most uncultivated arable land has the potential to help end the global food security and nutrition crisis
yet it fails to grow enough food even to feed its own people
africa's governments have recognised their responsibility to put in place the policies and investments which will enable the continent's farmers big and small to provide the food needed
they must deliver the improved infrastructure which is vital to this ambition
business must respond as well particularly by giving small holder farmers the access to new crop varieties techniques and markets
the third area where leadership is absolutely crucial is the climate crisis
how is it possible that climate change conferences continually fail to provide the breakthrough given that the science is so clear about the threat to future generations and our planet 
in december a global agreement must be reached in paris on the framework and policies needed to halt climate change
political leaders need to look beyond the next electoral cycle
civil society has largely already understood what needs to be done
i believe corporations will quickly respond to the challenge as many already have
there can be no clearer example of where our common values must be rediscovered
there are welcome signs that this is at last beginning to be understood
fourthly we know that successful peace processes are our only chance of escaping the circle of violence
without the resolve to address the past openly and without leaders showing the courage to give peace commissions the independence they need solutions will be haphazard
it takes courage to address the rights of victims genuinely but it is fundamental to heal wounds permanently
in a world riddled with conflict this courage will be more essential than ever
the international community needs to do more to support countries through this often difficult process
finally there is also an urgent need to step up support for democracy and elections
while almost every country now votes public faith in democracy is on the wane
in too many countries political leaders manipulate the process to deny their citizens a proper voice
even in mature democracies there is an increasingly widespread belief that elections change little and that the political elite serve only their only narrow interests
leaders in two thousand and fifteen will once more have the choice between using elections to give their regimes a veneer of democratic legitimacy or ensuring a level playing field respecting the secrecy of the ballot and above all accept the result peacefully
last year's successful presidential elections and peaceful hand over of power in indonesia the world's third largest democracy even when the result was very close provided real hope for the future
supporting the integrity of elections in africa and elsewhere will be an area like all these challenges i and my foundation sees as particular priorities this year
in times of uncertainty it is all too easy to surrender to fear and retreat look inward and think short term
but what is urgently needed is the ability in politics but also in business and society as a whole to look beyond national borders the next election or set of quarterly results
this must underpin not just discussions at davos but all our actions as voters citizens and consumers in the coming months and years

that seems to be the underlying message of a twenty nine second video posted online this week by british journalist owen thomas lambasting the condition of the first class cabin on a british airways flight
anticipating a luxurious experience on a flight from london to saint lucia on january seventeen thomas instead found a first class cabin he describes in the video as absolutely filthy and disgusting
in the video thomas a bloomberg tv anchor who has previously worked for cnn international and the bbc points out stained surfaces then lifts his seat cushion to reveal dirt and dust collected underneath
it's when you open your seat that the real horror begins thomas says in dramatic fashion narrating the video as he shoots it
this is british airways first class
it's disgusting
the video shows only thomas seating area and no other parts of the cabin
after the video went viral a ba spokesperson told london's telegraph
we are very sorry that on this occasion we have fallen short of our usual high standards
we pride ourselves on delivering a relaxing and pleasant experience in first class and are taking immediate action to address this issue
in december australia based airlineratings dot com placed ba ten th on its two thousand and fifteen airline excellence list of global airlines
in october ba was named the world's best airline with the third best first class in the london based business traveller awards two thousand and fourteen

french company newwind has created the arbre a vent or wind tree a three meter tall generator designed for urban environments which makes the most of smaller air currents
operating in near complete silence the wind tree consists of seventy two micro turbine aeroleaves that rotate in the wind generating an estimated three point one. kw of power
while this isn't much compared to industrial sized turbines which typically generate in the region of one three mw having multiple smaller turbines has its uses
urban wind is not very strong but it is very turbulent says arbre vent engineer julia revuz
these turbines need less wind to get started and produce around three kw of energy which could heat a small home fuel lights or charge an electric car
newwind was founded by jrme michaud larivire three years ago when he had the idea for the wind tree while taking a walk
he saw the leaves on a tree moving in the wind and started thinking about the possibility of turning that kinetic energy into electricity
the current prototype of the tree is steel and the energy made from it goes into the electricity grid and is used locally
we haven't yet optimized the structure says revuz
we are hoping to make the leaves out of eco friendly materials and for the tree to have as a low a carbon footprint as possible
a twelve meter tall prototype of the tree will be on display from march twelve for two months at place de la concorde a major public square in paris
this prototype which weighs around five tons and costs roughly thirty five thousand dollar is to be used as an educational tool and will aim to show the public the technology behind the structure
the wind tree will be mass produced for sale from march two thousand and fifteen and newwind says it has raised one point one five million to begin pre production
the reaction has been very positive so far explains revuz
people don't know how it works but they like it they find it magical
there is a very negative view of wind energy people think it's ugly and it ruins their landscapes
then they see the wind tree and they think differently
newwind has had interest from local government in france and europe as well as real estate agents and businesses that want to have the tree on their land
there are even talks about another demonstration tree in london next year
the wind tree may not be affordable and practical for everyone but there are other applications that could be more accessible
our technology is in the mini wind turbines says revuz
so we are developing other applications for them
architects have been in touch and are interested in using them in their work perhaps on the roofs of buildings
mini turbines are cheaper to produce and buy than the wind tree
other ideas for the aeroleaves include rooftop foliage installed on buildings foliage on roadsides and the smart balcony where the mini turbines are attached to balcony railings
however innovative this is not the first urban energy source inspired by nature check out the power flower and others in the gallery above

it has become a cultural symbol of a deeply divided nation
along its winding path and elsewhere polish photojournalist justyna mielnikiewicz met people whose lives have been profoundly changed since fighting erupted last year between ukrainian government forces and pro russia rebels
despite a shaky ceasefire which was reached last september sporadic fighting continues
i'm trying to show the amazing unbroken spirit of people which are united and determined to fight for what they believe mielnikiewicz told cnn on the phone this week
her camera captured fascinating people linked to the conflict
a masked fighter brandishing a piece of wood shaped like a rifle children wearing paramilitary uniforms standing at attention a young couple dramatically embracing in the midst of an intense protest
mielnikiewicz also photographed landscapes reflecting the mood of the region
a cable car suspended over the mighty dnieper giant concrete wave breakers blocking a road and a protest billboard depicting russian president vladimir putin wearing a hitler style mustache
the dnieper basically slices ukraine into two parts east and west as it flows roughly north to south connecting the capital kiev to the black sea
the farther east of the river you go residents tend to lean toward pro russia rebels
the farther west of the river people are more likely to support the government
i'm trying to keep a wider perspective mielnikiewicz said mindful that although the fighting has been limited to relatively small regions it has very much affected people nationwide
before the ceasefire an august report from the united nations said at least two thousand two hundred and twenty people had been killed since mid april two thousand and fourteen
at least five thousand nine hundred and fifty six had been wounded the report said not including the two hundred and ninety eight victims of malaysian airlines flight seventeen which was shot down over the region in july
russia annexed ukraine's semi autonomous region of crimea in march supported by crimea's ethnic russian majority
putin said russia was protecting crimea
but international opponents called it a land grab and slapped russia with economic sanctions
photographing people in war torn countries wasn't what mielnikiewicz had in mind when she first envisioned her career
she said she started as a very socially engaged person in general who aspired to become a painter
in a sense photography can combine those two things she said
you can be a socially engaged artist being a photographer
what interests me in photography is it can be a tool to be able to talk to people to discover their stories to tell their stories
she trained to become a film critic she said
but eventually mielnikiewicz knew she wanted to watch dramatic events unfold in real life instead of on the silver screen
her ukraine photos won mielnikiewicz a grant from the u.s. based aftermath project which encourages photographers to tell stories about the aftermath of conflict
she hopes she'll be able to return to ukraine this year to reunite with the people she met and see how their lives have changed
the ceasefire mielnikiewicz said doesn't seem to be working well
and the fighting 
it doesn't look like there's an end to it
nonetheless she said she's discovered firsthand something that ukrainians seem to share
the strength of ukraine is really amazing the determination she said
not just talking about the war i think they're a very strong people


we feel very sad and extremely guilty vice mayor zhou bo told a nationally televised press conference
we offer our deepest condolences to the victims and express our deepest apologies to their families as well as the injured and their families
an investigating team said the stampede happened at eleven thirty five p.m. local time when huge crowds trying to reach the iconic riverfront promenade known as the bund clashed with others attempting to leave on a staircase
most of the victims were in their twenty s with the youngest being only twelve years old
of the injured three remained in a serious condition in hospital as of wednesday
read
i failed to protect you details emerge from stampede
investigators blamed various government agencies of the city's huangpu district whose jurisdiction includes the bund for the fatal incident
they said local officials were ill prepared for the crowds and mishandled the aftermath
although the district authorities had earlier called off a popular riverfront light show on new year's eve thousands of revelers unaware of the cancellation due to the lack of official updates still flocked to the bund investigators said
they singled out the district police department for severely underestimating the crowd size which had reached three hundred and ten thousand people by midnight and assigning fewer than six hundred officers and other security personnel to the area
three top district officials in huangpu have been sacked the local communist party boss his deputy and the district police chief and a total of eleven officials face punishment for their role in the incident
in a nod to public criticism the ruling communist party's disciplinary arm in shanghai also confirmed on wednesday that several huangpu district officials including the fired communist boss and his deputy violated party regulations by wining and dining for free at a high end japanese restaurant on the bund shortly before the stampede
after chinese president xi jinping warned officials about public safety following the stampede authorities across the country have rushed to cancel large gatherings ranging from pop concerts to shopping festivals
but zhou shanghai's vice mayor said that after careful risk assessments officials have green lighted most planned events in the city for the upcoming chinese new year celebrations in february though the popular lantern festival at the ancient city temple won't go ahead

the plane ascended suddenly with a speed that was above the normal speed limit and then it went up transportation minister ignasius jonan told reporters after he briefed lawmakers at a parliamentary hearing
afterward it stalled
at one point the plane was climbing at a speed of six thousand feet per minute jonan said
a fighter jet like the f a eighteen super hornet can climb as fast as thirty thousand feet per minute
but commercial jets are designed to ascend at a much slower rate
the latest data show the airasia plane an airbus a three hundred and twenty was climbing at a rate twice as fast as it could and should do on its own cnn aviation analyst mary schiavo said
i think that means there was a tremendous amount of winds and weather she said
the commercial jet lost contact with air traffic controllers on december twenty eight as it flew from the indonesian city of surabaya toward singapore with one hundred and sixty two people on board
amid increasingly bad weather one of the pilots had requested to deviate from the plane's planned route airasia has said
and experts have speculated since day one that storms might have played a role in the plane crash
if the plane was climbing at six thousand feet per minute schiavo said numerous alarms would have sounded in the cockpit
but if the aircraft got caught in an updraft she said the pilots might not have been aware at first of why it was climbing so quickly when they weren't inputting that into the controls
picture your speedometer showing your car accelerating when your foot isn't pressing on the gas pedal
the pilots would have had control of the plane she said but may not have even realized what was occurring because of the confusing readings from the aircraft
last week searchers recovered the plane's flight data and voice data recorders which investigators hope will help them determine what happened aboard the doomed flight
indonesian investigators say audio recordings from the plane's cockpit contain no sounds of gunfire or explosions making it unlikely the plane was brought down by terrorism
while transportation officials focus on figuring out what happened search teams are still looking for most of the bodies of the people who were on board the plane
more than three weeks after the crash the remains of fifty three people have been recovered some of them still strapped into seats
many of the rest could be in the wreckage of the fuselage which searchers located last week at the bottom of the sea
efforts to examine and get inside the wreckage have been hindered by high waves and strong currents

the black clad isis militant shown in a video demanding a two hundred million dollar ransom to spare the lives of two japanese citizens looks and sounds similar to the man who has appeared in at least five previous hostage videos
the knife wielding masked man with a london accent nicknamed jihadi john has issued threats and overseen the beheadings of american and british captives
you now have seventy two hours to pressure your government in making a wise decision by paying the two hundred million dollar to save the lives of your citizens the man in the video that appeared tuesday says in comments addressed to japanese citizens
otherwise this knife will become your nightmare
the amount of money is the same as that recently pledged by japanese prime minister shinzo abe in humanitarian aid to middle east countries that are affected by isis bloody campaign in iraq and syria
japan believes the deadline arrives friday at twelve fifty a.m
et
and chief cabinet minister yoshihide suga said wednesday the country will do its best to communicate with isis through a third party nation
but mystery and confusion still surround the identity of jihadi john
u.s. and british officials have said they believe they know who he is but they haven't disclosed the information publicly
that could be because western intelligence agencies believe they have more to gain from keeping quiet says aki peritz a former cia officer
they can put pressure on his family put pressure on his friends he told cnn
maybe they have a line to him
maybe they know who his cousins are who are going to syria who can identify him
however if you publicly tell everybody who he is his real identity then maybe he'll go to ground and he'll disappear
there had been reports that jihadi john was injured in a bombing attack by the u.s. led anti isis coalition
but the video that appeared tuesday would suggest if it's really the same person that he's alive and well enough to make a death threat accompanied by a demand for money
his apparent reappearance helps isis slick propaganda machine which is used by the extremist group to raise money and recruit followers
it shows them resilient that they're able to film this video with these japanese hostages outside in broad daylight somewhere presumably in syria said cnn terrorism analyst paul cruickshank
five months and roughly two thousand airstrikes after isis video of the killing of u.s. journalist james foley why does one of the west's most prominent tormentors appear to still be at liberty 
u.s. and british military and intelligence officials declined to comment on the matter
experts say the problem lies in the extreme difficulty of infiltrating commandos into syria to reach jihadi john
isis operates in what we call denied territory said cedric leighton a retired u.s. air force colonel
and that means by definition that it's very hard for our folks to get in there it's very hard for them to actually lay eyes on target
a mission by u.s. special operations forces in july failed to find foley and other hostages in syria
the attempt to rescue mr. foley is one of the things that has now made the white house very reluctant to act aggressively said tony shaffer a former u.s. intelligence operative who directed special operations in iraq and afghanistan
a senior u.s. administration official however said the u.s. government is actively pursuing justice for the slayings of the hostages
the fbi has an open criminal investigation and as you have seen we will hold terrorists like this accountable no matter how long it takes the official said on condition of anonymity
for operational security reasons we are not in a position to detail all of the steps we are undertaking
meanwhile as isis deadline draws nearer the japanese government has to decide how it will respond to the extremists latest life or death ultimatum

heartbroken tributes poured in from the twenty four year old's surfing peers
an incredible human being
wrote carlos burle another top brazilian surfer in a post on instagram
he said dos santos had a whole life ahead of him
dos santos was a fearless world class tuberider who captured the surf world's attention at the two thousand and twelve billabong pro event in tahiti according to surfer magazine
the off duty police officer shot dos santos three times in the chest monday after the two had an argument in front of the surfer's family home in the brazilian state of santa catarina according to cnn affiliate record news
doctors carried out surgery four times to try to save him the broadcaster reported
as his life hung in the balance many of his friends and fans took to social media pulling for him to make a recovery
some urged people to make blood donations
we're all together with you brother burle wrote on instagram
but the doctors couldn't stop the bleeding
dos santos died tuesday
we need to pray and thank god for the time he lived among us his father said
a great athlete he was an example
the police officer suspected in the shooting identified as luis paulo mota brentano has been arrested but says he shot the surfer in self defense according to record news
many in the surfing community found it hard to grasp what had happened
he represented all of us very well and was very well recognized for his hard work and also was a very good person said gabriel medina brazil's first surfing world champion
there are certain things that we do not understand
adriano de souza another brazilian pro surfer said it was difficult to find words for the situation

in a statement posted to its google plus account the company said it would still be working on smart glasses but that january nineteen would be the last day to get the current glass explorer edition
the statement explained that google glass will graduate from the google x incubator and become its own division which will report to nest founder tony fadell
glass has been on sale since two thousand and thirteen in the united states and allows the user to send messages navigate and record video using voice commands
but since its launch glass has come up against safety and privacy issues
some agreed it was time for a revamp
others saw it as a positive development for glass
many had their own views on why production had been stopped
but whatever the response it's unlikely that this is the end of google glass
nick thompson editor of the new yorker dot com told cnn that glass may well be back in a year or so revamped and redesigned
and he is confident that fadell is the right man for the job

vital signs is a monthly program bringing viewers health stories from around the world
it had moved from one side of the brain to the other
very few things move in the brain says dr. effrossyni gkrania klotsas about a british man found to have a tapeworm moving inside his brain in two thousand and thirteen
this form of tapeworm had never been seen before in the united kingdom
the patient who was of chinese descent had recently visited china which along with south korea japan and thailand has more regular occurrences of the parasite known as spirometra erinaceieuropaei
four years earlier the man had first experienced symptoms such as headaches which the team of doctors at addenbrookes hospital in cambridge had treated as tuberculosis
but then he returned
when he reappeared he had new symptoms says gkrania klotsas
the worm was now pushing on a new part of his brain causing seizures and weakness in his legs
the condition associated with his infection was in fact sparganosis
there is no known drug to effectively treat the infection meaning that upon diagnosis doctors had to be quick to remove the worm surgically
read
are we closer to hiv vaccine 
just three hundred infections of the spirometra tapeworm were recorded between one thousand nine hundred and fifty three and two thousand and thirteen but they're thought to be more common in parts of asia
the rural nature of more affected populations means numbers are widely unknown and very little is known about the worms
these worms are pretty mysterious says geneticist hayley bennett from the wellcome trust sanger institute in cambridge whose team recently sequenced the genome of the rare worm
we know it has a very complicated life cycle
the adult form of the spirometra tapeworm only occurs in the intestines of cats and dogs but as these animals shed the worms eggs in their feces the eggs can enter and contaminate water
the resulting juvenile form of tapeworm known as larvae can then stay in the water within certain small crustaceans or end up in frogs and snakes
as larvae they can invade humans through ingestion or direct contact with infected animals
the patient in cambridge was thought to have accidentally drunk water whilst swimming in an infected lake according to gkrania klotsas
the worm then took hold
the larvae can encyst in the brain or somewhere else says bennett
the consequences of these cysts can be tissue damage blindness paralysis or even death
by sequencing the worm's genes bennett hoped to understand the inner workings of the worms to aid future diagnosis and treatment
because it's such a rare infection it's not economically viable to create a drug just for this worm she explains
but by comparing it to other tapeworms we can see which other drugs might apply
the team were given small samples of the worm extracted from the infected patient and their sequencing identified an exceptionally large genome and importantly genes which could help recognize resistance to drugs as well as act as future drug targets
you could also develop a diagnostic test adds bennett
there are many forms of tapeworm three of which can readily infect the brain
from a public health perspective there's one in particular to watch out for
it's mainly the pork tapeworm that's the main brain one says helena helmby from the london school of hygiene and tropical medicine
the pork species known as taenia solium can infect humans in two forms
the first is by eating undercooked pork from infected pigs resulting in taeniasis an adult worm residing in the intestine
the second in the larval form through contact with the feces of an infected pig or human which can go on to infect many tissues
if the larval worm enters the nervous system including the brain it can result in a condition known as neurocysticercosis
infection of this kind can often cause epilepsy once inside the brain
almost a third of epilepsy cases in countries where the disease is native are people who have previously had neurocysticercosis according to the world health organization
neurocysticercosis infection arises from poor sanitation and hygiene
you can actually infect yourself says helmby as poor hygiene such as failing to wash your hands could result in you eating the eggs of an adult worm living in your intestine
self infection is common
the global distribution of pork tapeworms is widespread with high numbers across latin america africa and asia according to the world health organization
as a result of its higher prevalence and due to increased international travel gkrania klotsas has three patients in her care in cambridge who have previously experienced neurocysticercosis
infections with pork tapeworms are common but treatable with antihelminthic drugs targeting the worm
until now treatment for spirometra has been surgical but the recent genetic insight from bennett's team in cambridge found that some drugs such as praziqantil which is used against schistosomiasis could have an effect
certain drugs used against cancer were also identified as potential treatments
both helmby and gkrania klotsas are concerned about risks from increased international travel and the global food trade
food import and export is increasing and increasing risks of consuming infected goods says helmby who feels there is a need for more vigilance with food inspection
she predicts more cases will occur in places like the united kingdom where such infections have been virtually eliminated
i'm confident there will be more of this in the future agrees gkrania klotsas who has seen patients infected without having traveled abroad
people are getting infections without going anywhere
those who do travel however also need greater awareness when visiting regions where infections are commonplace
but if health teams are ready for the consequences this rise can be controlled
we need to be able to treat these infections says helmby
that's the challenge at the moment
a challenge where genetics researchers could prove invaluable as their sequencing continues to reveal the secrets of these parasites

prosecutor alberto nisman was found dead in his apartment just one day before he was supposed to testify before lawmakers about allegations that the country's most powerful officials conspired to cover up iran's involvement in the one thousand nine hundred and ninety four bombing
government officials called it a suicide but theories of something more sinister arose immediately
protesters took to the streets monday night near the presidential palace the casa rosada waving argentine flags and holding signs proclaiming yo soy nisman or i am nisman
in a report nisman filed last week he alleged that argentine president cristina fernandez de kircher and foreign minister hector timerman among others covered up iran's involvement in the bombing of a jewish community center more than twenty years ago that left eighty five people dead
the fernandez government pushed the suicide theory pointing to the evidence
nisman was found dead from a gunshot wound to his temple in his apartment bathroom a twenty two caliber gun and a shell casing near his body
but a test for gunpowder residue on nisman's hands came back negative said viviana fein the federal prosecutor leading the investigation into his death
fein said the result does not rule out the possibility that nisman shot himself it only shows that no gunpowder residue was found as would be expected if he pulled the trigger
fein had said earlier that the medical examiner concluded that there was no third party involved in nisman's death
an investigation into the suicide claim has to include a look at whether such an act was provoked or induced by some other person she said
for protesters in buenos aires plaza de mayo the prosecutor's death struck a deeper chord
the killing of nisman will mobilize the argentine people to put an end to the corruption to end this state of disaster that we live in here in argentina one protester said
one woman compared the country's politicians to the mafia and another said that argentine democracy was not a democracy anymore
the investigation into the deadliest bombing in argentina's history led nisman down a trail that he seemingly understood to be dangerous
after filing the complaint last week against the president foreign minister and other officials he made a prescient comment about the investigation
i could end up dead from this nisman told a reporter
twice
his premonition came true the next day
diego guelar a former argentine ambassador to the united states told cnn en espaol that the suicide explanation is ridiculous
nisman was committed to his investigation which he had been overseeing since two thousand and four guelar said
the prosecutor voluntarily wanted to testify before congress about what he considered irrefutable evidence of a governmental cover up regarding the one thousand nine hundred and ninety four bombing guelar said
without a doubt this is an incident that has shocked all argentines very strongly he said
the fernandez administration hit back sharply after nisman's complaint was filed last week denying that there was a cover up about iranian links to the bombing of the argentine israelite mutual association building
prosecutors in argentina have alleged for years that iran was behind the attack but a criminal investigation has stalled in part because iran denies the charges and has not made the accused available to prosecutors
argentina requested the arrest of several iranians in two thousand and seven in connection with the bombing including the current defense minister of iran ahmad vahidi
interpol approved so called red notices for these suspects alerting countries around the world of buenos aires desire to have them arrested
to surpass this roadblock fernandez signed an agreement with iran to create a joint commission to investigate the bombing
she said it would move the investigation along while critics said such a probe would only protect the iranian suspects
in his report nisman alleged that fernandez and timerman wanted to cover up iran's involvement in order to boost trade specifically oil imports and grain exports with the islamic republic
suicide provokes in all cases first
disbelief and then
questions
what was it that led a person to make the terrible decision to take his own life 
fernandez wrote in a lengthy letter she posted on her facebook page
she hailed her own involvement in the investigation into the bombing dating back to her time as a lawmaker in the early two thousand s. as the investigation progressed politically motivated conspiracy theories and allegations arose she said
as time goes on instead of clarifying everything becomes more opaque fernandez wrote
it became complicated and there was a growing sensation at least for me of being in a theater of national and international politics in which the victims were important to very few and the truth even more so
nisman's allegations of a cover up she said were intended to lie disguise and confuse
in the wake of nisman's death a judge has ordered that all of the the evidence collected by the prosecutor be preserved said patricia bullrich an argentine lawmaker and head of the committee that invited nisman to testify
nisman's role was to investigate the bombing in which eight iranians had been charged bullrich told cnn en espaol
in the course of that investigation nisman came upon evidence that led to his claims of a cover up the lawmaker said
after nisman filed his complaint with the new allegations last week it was bullrich who invited him to speak before congress
he was found dead just hours before he was supposed to testify
in the days before his death on sunday the prosecutor was very active very focused on the presentation he was going to give before congress in the evidence he was going to present and his mind made up about going forward with it bullrich said
it's hard to believe that he would have taken his own life




in a video posted tuesday to social media a black clad isis militant stood over two men he said were japanese citizens
both would die he said unless the japanese government paid the islamist extremist group two hundred million dollar within seventy two hours
that isis wants ransom isn't unexpected
but a few things like the public nature and staggering amount of the request make it stand out
yes
it's hard to quantify all the examples because hostage takers in ambitious militant groups like isis rarely make their demands public
but just as kidnappings are the norm for such groups so is asking for ransom
one documented example is the case of james foley an american journalist abducted in northern syria in november two thousand and twelve
isis would later demand one hundred million euros for his release said richard byrne a spokesman for the news website globalpost that foley freelanced for before
neither globalpost nor foley's family nor the u.s. government paid that amount
even if they had there's no telling if isis would have kept its word and freed foley
instead the group not only beheaded foley but recorded his killing and put it online for the world to see
one thing that makes the latest ransom request unique is that isis made it publicly and set a three day deadline for it to be met
this suggests as much posturing as fundraising especially when coupled with its decrying japan for supporting governments involved in the anti isis fight
isis rationale seems similar to other terror groups
kidnappings help raise money and if ransoms aren't paid make a point such as the groups are not to be messed with and even civilians are in danger
rationalizing the public relations strategy of a group like isis can be a challenge
but there's no doubt the group uses modern technology to get the word out on its captives including when they are beheaded
such pictures further the image of isis as a ruthless defiant organization dedicated to wiping out anyone soldiers or civilians who doesn't follow its extreme conservative version of sharia law
the money making aspect is more under the radar but still significant
the u.s. treasury department estimated in two thousand and twelve that al qaeda and its affiliates compiled one hundred and twenty million dollar from ransoms over the previous eight years
and a new york times investigative piece from july two thousand and fourteen determined that al qaeda and its affiliates took in one hundred and twenty five million dollar since two thousand and eight including sixty six million dollar in two thousand and thirteen alone
there hasn't been a similarly detailed review for isis but that doesn't mean ransoms in addition to things like oil revenues criminal enterprises as well as taxes tolls and other fees imposed on those in its territories aren't a significant part of the group's budget
countries don't advertise how much they pay in ransom
doing so could invite kidnappers to seize their citizens for ransom
but that doesn't mean some countries don't do it
the summer two thousand and fourteen new york times article citing french media reports identified france as the country that pays out the most to al qaeda affiliates
france's reported fifty eight million dollar figure since two thousand and eight is far higher than the next highest total twenty million dollar as paid out from oman and qatar
the times reports that switzerland paid out twelve million dollar spain eleven million dollar and austria three million dollar in the same time frame
it's not just al qaeda that france has dealt with
four french journalists taken captive by isis were released last april
a group's ransom request could depend on a lot of factors
a high profile hostage for instance could demand a higher price
and a solitary kidnapper may ask less than one belonging to a large powerful defiant group especially one like isis that's proved its willingness to kill civilians
the amount of ransom requested and paid apparently has gone up
a decade ago the times reported that a standard asking price might be two hundred thousand dollar
nowadays it's more likely to be in the millions
phil balboni globalpost's ceo told cnn that european governments have paid between two million dollar and four million dollar for hostages
but it is not two hundred million dollar as was requested for the two japanese hostages
nor is it the one hundred and thirty two million dollar requested for foley
both figures from isis are exceedingly high and seem to suggest the group is as interested in making a point as it is in making money given the unlikelihood it will be paid
on tuesday japanese prime minister shinzo abe did not rule out paying a ransom or negotiating with his two citizens captors
does that mean tokyo is willing to pay or at least talk 
not necessarily
japan hasn't said it has paid ransoms before and there's no reason to think the country would in this case
japan signed a two thousand and thirteen g eight communique that stated we unequivocally reject the payment of ransoms to terrorists and we call on countries and companies around the world to follow our lead to stamp this out
this policy mirrors those of the united kingdom and the united states with foley's mother diane telling cnn that a u.s. official once threatened her with prosecution if she tried to raise ransom on her own
why wouldn't countries like these two and japan tap into their relatively vast resources to save the lives of their citizens 
for one thing groups like isis and al qaeda may not be the most trustworthy so paying up won't necessarily guarantee a release
and it might end up putting others at risk both by encouraging more kidnappings and funding those behind mass killings
as under secretary for terrorism and financial intelligence david s. cohen argued in two thousand and twelve ransom payments lead to future kidnappings and future kidnappings lead to additional ransom payments
and it all builds the capacity of terrorist organizations to conduct attacks
some say that countries with no ransom policies can end up giving militant groups incentives to kidnap more people if they negotiate with them
this debate raged after the taliban's release of u.s. army sgt
bowe bergdahl last year in exchange for five taliban figures then in u.s. military custody at guantanamo bay cuba
president barack obama said afterward i make absolutely no apologies for making sure we get a young man back to his parents
in japan's case such a prisoner swap isn't an option
it's not as if the country has a lot of suspected isis members in its custody
so tokyo's bargaining chips might consist more of doing something like not giving two hundred million dollar to those invested in the anti isis fight a pledge that abe said tuesday he's not willing to rescind
isis history shows there may not be a lot but it's possible that there will be talks with the isis hostage takers
japan can point to the fact that unlike the united states and britain it's not involved directly with the military effort in iraq or syria
isis might surprise everyone by freeing the japanese pair as a goodwill gesture
but absent a last ditch diplomatic effort japan may have to rely on military forces from allies in the west the middle east or elsewhere to rescue its citizens
whatever the approach time is clearly running out

a day earlier ukrainian prime minister arseniy yatsenyuk said russian troops had crossed the border to support pro russian rebels
ukraine and the west for months have accused russia of supporting rebels in eastern ukraine by sending in russian troops weapons and supplies
the united states and european countries have imposed economic sanctions on russia over its involvement in ukraine while russian officials have frequently denied claims their military has sent forces to bolster the rebels
on tuesday russian defense ministry spokesman maj. gen. igor konashenkov said monday's allegations were designed to attract sympathy and investment for ukraine at this week's gathering of political and business leaders in davos switzerland
yatsenyuk according to ukraine's state run media said monday that his country's military confirmed the fact military personnel and equipment have been transferred from russia to ukraine
tanks grad multiple rocket systems buk and smerch systems radio electronic intelligence systems are not sold at local donetsk street markets
only the russian army and defense ministry have them yatsenyuk said
the prime minister's spokeswoman olga lappo confirmed to cnn the quotes attributed to yatsenyuk are accurate
unrest in ukraine began with protests in the country's capital last year after pro moscow president viktor yanukovych favoring closer ties to russia dropped plans to sign a political and economic agreement with the european union
after months of protests and days of deadly clashes between demonstrators and security personnel in kiev parliament ousted yanukovych in february
weeks later russia annexed the crimean peninsula
in april violence broke out in two ukrainian regions that border russia donetsk and luhansk as separatist leaders declared independence from the government in kiev
pro russian separatists have claimed control of parts of donetsk and luhansk since the spring despite a push by ukrainian forces to defeat them
from mid april to september sixteen alone at least three thousand five hundred people were killed and at least eight thousand one hundred others were wounded in the conflict according to the united nations

our latest estimate today is that india has seventy percents of the world's tiger population and we have now two thousand two hundred and twenty six tigers presently in forty seven tiger reserves up from one thousand seven hundred and six in two thousand and eleven and this is a great achievement
it is a net increase of thirty percents over the last estimation environment minister prakash javadekar said in a statement monday
researchers involved in the study the third of its kind carried out in india say they used advanced technology to assess the population of the big cats
debbie banks head of the tiger campaign at the environmental investigation agency which carries out extensive research on the illegal tiger trade welcomed news of the study saying she looked forward to seeing the full report when it releases in march
i think it has set india apart from some of the other tiger range countries
if you look at china laos cambodia vietnam thailand there's more emphasis on tigers in captivity farming and valuing tigers for their body parts higher than the survival of tigers in the wild she says to cnn
india's once thriving tiger population has been severely affected by poaching a reduction in prey habitat destruction and conflict with villagers who may occupy the same area
although preliminary results of the government's study are promising banks warns against complacency
while this is good news from india i don't think anyone is sitting back and saying we've won 
the demand within china for skins to decorate homes and bones for tiger bone wine all continue
and so it's a constant battle
a major challenge is also the sophistication of the tiger trade where body parts of the animal are transported across unofficial borders such as mountain passes
the criminals have changed their practice
and there's no evidence of any enforcement there she says
a historical symbol of power and beauty in cultures such as india and china the significance of the tiger goes beyond its aesthetics banks says
tigers are major indicator of the health of the environment certainly the health of the forest that they inhabit
but they are the water gods if you like
they are indicators of how well we are doing to conserve forests that provide water for millions of people and mitigate climate change
there's an ecosystem reason to save wild tigers
and if today's results are anything to go by banks says india appears to be leading that charge
india despite all the problems it has with high human population in small areas is totally setting the benchmark for wild tiger conservation

so far there has been no decision to evacuate the embassy
the uss iwo jima and the uss fort mchenry were moved because they will be in the best position if asked by the state department to evacuate the embassy a u.s. official with direct knowledge of the planning tells cnn
so far there has been decision to evacuate the embassy and no request from the state department for military assistance
if an evacuation is ordered the first option would be to have embassy personnel drive to the commercial airport in sanaa and fly out the official said
but in the wake of an embassy car being fired tuesday the safety of the roads in the capital is now being constantly evaluated the official said
if embassy workers did drive to the airport it is likely some sort of air cover would be provided under the current plan
other detailed military planning for various options has been finalized the official said
those options would be used if a request for military assistance were made
if helicopters and v twenty two aircraft from the ships are sent to sanaa it would be a complex operation that could last for several days to fully evacuate several hundred americans from the embassy the official cautioned
nobody should think this would be easy
the military is aware the state department wants to keep the embassy open as long as possible the official said noting that it's a valuable tool to monitor al qaeda in yemen
but behind the scenes the pentagon is pressing the point that if an evacuation becomes necessary they want to do it before the chaos in sanaa descends into a non permissive environment akin to combat
for now the us believes the houthis are not targeting americans but its not clear if that will last
the plan at this point only involves the potential evacuation of state department personnel
it would be up to state to decide if it wants to extend the potential mission to other americans in yemen

he announced confidently to a group that included a number of british parliamentarians that the police in the united kingdom don't dare to tread in these zones where sharia law is widely used
nonassimilationist muslims establish enclaves and carry out as much of sharia law as they can without regard for the laws of the democratic countries which provided them a new home he said
this is the sort of ill informed fantasy that plays well in certain right wing circles
this probably works for jindal back home in louisiana
oddly enough fox news got into trouble recently on the no go zone nonsense too as when steve emerson a so called terrorism expert explained to the american masses that birmingham a major british urban center was populated entirely by muslims and that non muslims just simply don't go in
british prime minister david cameron correctly labeled him a complete idiot and emerson's remark caused a spokesperson for the network to admit that muslim no go zones don't actually exist not in britain not in europe
needless to say there are places where a lot of muslim immigrants live in close proximity and outsiders might feel uncomfortable walking around
the same would be true for parts of america where you might feel uncomfortable walking around if you were say black or white it would depend on the neighborhood
it's not unusual for socio economic even racial or ethnic groups to cluster
my own grandparents came to the united states as immigrants in one thousand nine hundred and twelve and they lived for some years in italian ghettos in new york
most immigrant groups start in ghettos somewhere and many of them never get out
but the question of sharia law is interesting
unofficial sharia courts will be found in europe here and there
but these arbitration bodies don't trump the legal system of the country where they occur
an article in the economist noted in fact that there have long been rabbinical courts in jewish neighborhoods in britain not a dissimilar sort of thing
there are even places in the united states where christians can work out their disputes in a kind of extrajudicial manner
family law for instance is often the issue here and there are cultural values that play into the need for this kind of culturally inflected arbitration
that in some muslim neighborhoods there might be an accommodation to sharia law seems not surprising and this doesn't mean that sooner or later we can expect adulterous women to be stoned to death in birmingham or thieves to have their hands lopped off in east london
blasphemy will not soon lead to the gas chamber in europe indeed capital punishment is not legal in any european country
getting back to gov
jindal one has to wonder what prompted his ignorant outburst
was this a lame attempt to play into the broad public fears of radical islam that have arisen in the wake of the charlie hebdo killings 
if so that's not good enough for a politician with any shred of integrity
in my view jindal immediately disqualified himself from ever holding a national political office by making such a bizarre statement though it hasn't stopped any number of american politicians with bizarre notions from winning major national offices in the past
such behavior does however embarrass this country in the court of world opinion
the british and most european countries have struggled to accommodate muslim immigrants but they have nevertheless welcomed them in large numbers
for the most part these immigrants have behaved well despite the fear of their traditions and beliefs that leads to crazy exaggerations by politicians such as jindal
there have been isolated and gruesome incidents of terrorism the murder of a british soldier lee rigby in the spring of two thousand and thirteen comes to mind or the vicious attacks in london of july seven two thousand and five which left fifty two dead and over seven hundred injured
the british have had to confront terror and they've done so without vilifying large parts of their own population
indeed they've been forced to come to terms with what i would call british exceptionalism the old imperial feeling that nobody who is not british can possibly lead a civilized way of life
jindal was apparently on a ten day fact finding mission designed to bolster his credentials for a possible run at the white house in two thousand and sixteen
he's not as stupid as he sounds in fact
let's hope that he is a quick study and that he learns how not to say idiotic things in public that cause a good deal of offense if not harm to unsuspecting people fueling hatred rather than coming to terms

yemen's president resigned shortly after his prime minister and the cabinet stepped down seismic changes in the country's political scene a day after the government and houthi rebels had struck a tentative peace deal meant to end turmoil

but on tuesday the situation in yemen apparently became much more dire as the country's minister of information said shiite houthi rebels had taken over the nation's presidential palace
amid reports of renewed fighting in yemen nadia sakkaf told cnn that the residence of yemen's prime minister was under attack
sakkaf called the situation the completion of a coup adding that president abdu rabu mansour hadi has no control
yemen the poorest country in the region is home to al qaeda in the arabian peninsula or aqap which most recently claimed responsibility for the massacre of journalists at the french satirical magazine charlie hebdo in paris
it's one of the world's biggest exporters of terrorism
aqap is benefiting hugely from the current conflict in yemen
gunfire could be heard throughout the capital sanaa on tuesday as cnn's nick paton walsh reported that security there was tenuous
on monday night unknown assailants fired shots at a u.s. embassy vehicle in the city the embassy said
it has said it's prepared to evacuate but no orders have been given
here are seven things you need to know about what's happening in yemen and why it matters
yemen is a country of about twenty six million people on the southwestern tip of the arabian peninsula
it borders saudi arabia and oman and is near important red sea shipping lanes
yemen is a young nation having been created in one thousand nine hundred and ninety when north and south yemen united
the north and south started a civil war within a few years with the north prevailing after thousands died
yemen is very poor because of declining oil resources
because terrorists in yemen have reached into the united states
remember umar farouk abdulmutallab the underwear bomber who tried to blow up an american jetliner over detroit in two thousand and nine 
he took his marching orders from aqap
the boston marathon bombing suspects and maj. nidal hasan the american soldier who gunned down thirteen people at fort hood texas apparently were inspired by an american born cleric in yemen anwar al awlaki
an american drone killed him in two thousand and eleven
many would be jihadis from the west are recruited into al qaeda through a slick english language online magazine inspire that's run out of yemen
u.s. officials consider aqap the most dangerous branch of al qaeda according to cnn terrorism analyst paul cruickshank
it's actually a three way battle among the government the houthis and aqap
the houthis a rebel group composed of shiite muslims feel marginalized in the majority sunni country
in september houthis seized government buildings in sanaa and its airport
they demanded greater political influence
president hadi introduced a new constitution without the houthis approval and the rebels abducted yemen's presidential chief of staff to show their disapproval
in response the government closed roads as a security measure
that set off renewed fighting
most of the recent fighting has been for control of the presidential complex
on monday the government and the houthis announced another ceasefire
hadi has battled aqap since taking office in two thousand and twelve and the united states has invested heavily in this campaign
he reorganized yemen's military and for a while put aqap on the defensive
but the conflict with the houthis diverted resources that could be used against aqap
aqap is working to keep things unstable but it doesn't look like the group has been involved in the sanaa fighting so far
in october aqap staged a suicide bombing against a houthi rally that killed fifty people
it also released a video showing members executing fourteen houthis
at the same time it has stepped up attacks against police and the army
no way
in fact they're adversaries in the long running sunni shiite conflict
differences between the two main branches of islam developed over the centuries
shiite muslims believed the prophet mohammed's cousin should have been the successor after his death in in a.d. six hundred and thirty two while sunnis believe a successor should have been elected
only ten percents of the world's muslim population is shiite
they're named after the late cleric hussein badreddin al houth who was killed during a two thousand and four rebellion against the government in saada according to the u.s. state department
houthis are mostly militias and tribes that follow the zaidi sect of islam
al qaeda considers them shiites
some members of al qaeda and even western diplomats allege that iran one of the few shiite muslim nations is bankrolling the houthi rebellion in an effort to control yemen's red sea coast on one of the world's busiest shipping lanes
the houthis deny iran is funding them
hadi has said the houthis are being trained and advised by hezbollah the lebanese shiite militia
some presidential officials are worried about actions by republican guards former regime officials who are still loyal to ali abdullah saleh the ex president who was kicked out in two thousand and twelve during the arab spring
the weaker the government the easier it will be for al qaeda to bring in people and train them for terrorism
the chaos hampers western efforts to hunt down al qaeda and hampers western efforts to even be in the country

while there have also been largely peaceful protests authorities from africa to the middle east are seeing clashes in the streets and seeking ways to tamp down the uproar among muslims furious over depictions of the prophet mohammed
the deadliest violence has been in niger where authorities report ten people killed
churches and homes have been destroyed the government said in a statement
afp the france based news wire service said police reported that one hundred and seventy three people have been injured
at least forty five churches have been set ablaze in the capital alone and a christian school and orphanage were also set alight
numerous sites were pillaged before being burned
video from niamey showed protesters waving qurans and yelling god is great while tearing apart bibles and throwing them onto the ground
a bar owned by people from france could also be seen burning
three days of mourning began monday the government announced
in karachi pakistan police used tear gas and water cannons to disperse protesters outside the french consulate
a pakistani photographer for afp was shot and wounded the news agency reported
at least two hundred protesters were involved in the violence which broke out after muslim religious parties called on supporters to condemn the cartoon following afternoon prayers said ahmed chinoy chief of karachi's citizen police liaison committee
images from the scene showed police in running street fights with demonstrators
those protests came after pakistan's parliament unanimously passed a resolution condemning the caricatures printed in charlie hebdo
in algeria clashes erupted between demonstrators and police as well
and in jordan the muslim brotherhood organized a crowd of two thousand protesters who clashed with police in the capital of amman as they moved toward the french embassy usa today reported
police used batons to break up the gathering
in gaza some two hundred radical islamists tried to storm the french cultural centre in gaza city on monday shouting slogans threatening the lives of staff over charlie hebdo cartoons afp reported adding that the protesters chanted damnation upon france 
and waved black flags adopted by jihadists
leave gaza you french or we will slaughter you by cutting your throats the protesters chanted according to afp
palestinian police arrested dozens who tried to break into the french cultural center the report said
the israeli newspaper haaretz said activists in gaza wore uniforms similar to those of isis militants
the paper quoted one protester abu abdallah makdissi as saying today we are telling france and world countries that while islam orders us to respect all religions it also orders us to punish and kill those who assault and offend islam's prophet mohammed
there have been large scale peaceful protests reported in several african nations including including mali and somalia and parts of the middle east including lebanon
thousands from russia's north caucasus gathered in grozny chechnya for a peaceful event called love for the prophet mohammed russia's state run tass news agency said
news reports estimated hundreds of thousands may have taken part
in senegal and mauritania protesters torched french flags the french news agency france twenty four reported
there were similar scenes in iran where protesters burned u.s. and israeli flags

the suspected key link between senior isis operatives in syria and the belgian terrorist cell belgian moroccan isis fighter abdelhamid abaaoud is still at large a senior belgian counterterrorism official said
abaaoud's last known location was believed to be greece the official said
from antwerp to aleppo and back
europe's nightmare
as belgium's search continues other european nations are also moving in on suspected islamist cells amid concerns heightened by the terror attacks in paris two weeks ago
here's a look at the latest developments
police in berlin brandenburg and thuringen raided thirteen properties linked to suspected radical islamists overnight police in the german capital said tuesday
most of the action was directed at a group connected to a mosque in the district of berlin moabit
the overnight raids are part of the investigation into two alleged islamists who were arrested friday identified as ismet d. and emin f. berlin police said
both of them are accused of providing logistical aid to isis
some two hundred police officers were involved in the raids at thirteen sites across three german states
those subject to the raids have not yet been accused of any crimes but had contact with ismet d. and emin f
there are no indications that the group was preparing attacks in germany
five belgian nationals have been charged with participation in a terrorist organization in connection with last week's raids federal prosecutor eric van der sypt said
the terror cell was on the brink of an attack and planned to target police officers he said
belgian counterterrorism agencies say they suspect that the ringleader of the cell is abaaoud the senior belgian counterterrorism official said
abaaoud is also known as abou omar soussi and abou omar al belgiki the official said
according to guy van vlierden a reporter at the belgian newspaper hln who tracks belgian foreign fighters in syria for the blog emmejihad abaaoud is a twenty seven year old from the molenbeek district of brussels who traveled to syria in january two thousand and fourteen and joined isis soon afterward
the two gunmen killed in one of the raids in the city of verviers are belgians of north african descent from the same brussels district
they were in phone contact with an isis ringleader in greece who belgian authorities believe was probably abaaoud
but belgian authorities have not ruled out the possibility that an algerian suspect arrested in greece over the weekend was the key link between the terror cell and isis
that thirty three year old suspect was wanted in belgium on charges of terrorist activity greek police said monday
belgium is requesting an extradition
one suspect survived the police raid in verviers named as marouane el bali
he was taken into custody and faces charges of participation in a terrorist organization and possession of explosives with intent to commit a criminal attack among other charges said his attorney didier de quevy
but de quevy said his client was not involved in any terrorism
he was just delivering shoes to a friend when he was caught in the wrong place at the wrong time
five men purportedly russians of chechen origin were arrested in southern france overnight while planning an act of terrorism according to french media reports tuesday
a cache of explosives was found according to midi libre and other media outlets quoting police sources and the local prosecutor yvon calvet
cnn has not yet been able to confirm the reports
meanwhile the paris prosecutor's office said tuesday that four men arrested friday are being placed under criminal investigation in connection with the paris terror attacks
they are under investigation for association with a criminal terrorist organization with the objective of committing crimes against people
in addition one of those in custody will be under formal investigation for possession or transport of weapons linked to a terrorist enterprise
the four men ages twenty two twenty five twenty six and twenty eight will remain in custody
five other suspects held since friday were released monday night
investigators say dna found in a car used to transport jewish market attack gunman amedy coulibaly has been traced to a man who is already in custody in connection with the attacks according to a source familiar with the ongoing investigation
investigators are still looking for a person whose dna was found on a magazine for coulibaly's gun
coulibaly killed four hostages on january nine at a kosher grocery store in paris before police killed him
he's also believed to have killed a policewoman a day earlier
before the siege he had proclaimed his allegiance to the islamic state in iraq and syria or isis
new surveillance video obtained by cnn shows coulibaly and his partner hayat boumedienne outside a jewish institution in paris
the video was recorded at the end of august or beginning of september and stored on a security camera
a source familiar with the ongoing investigation into the paris attacks says the nature of the video makes it clear that the couple was carrying out surveillance of possible targets for several months before coulibaly launched his attack against the kosher supermarket
new york mayor bill de blasio visited the scene of the siege tuesday and he added flowers to a mound of bouquets candles and handwritten tributes to those killed
he voiced his solidarity with france as it combats terrorism and he met with representatives of the jewish community
the supermarket assault happened during three days of terror in paris that began with the january seven attack on offices of the charlie hebdo satirical newspaper by gunmen said and cherif kouachi
in all twelve people died in the charlie hebdo attack
the funeral for maintenance worker frederic boisseau the first person to be killed took place tuesday
al qaeda in the arabian peninsula al qaeda's yemen affiliate claimed responsibility for the charlie hebdo shootings
france's le monde newspaper suffered a different kind of attack on tuesday when its official twitter account was apparently hacked by the syrian electronic army a group of pro syrian regime hackers that has aggressively targeted major news organizations and activists
one post that appeared on the newspaper's twitter account said je ne suis pas charlie and decried attacks on syria
after the hacking of our account our teams have taken it back into our hands the newspaper's account said in another tweet about an hour later
we apologize for any fraudulent posts on our behalf

a soft spoken and shy man shin shared his harrowing story about escaping from a total control zone called camp fourteen giving western audiences an accessible reading on north korea
over the weekend shin stated that parts of his stories are inaccurate although he did not specify which aspects
he posted on facebook that parts of his past that i so badly wanted to cover up can no longer be hidden
blaine harden author of escape from camp fourteen wrote on his website that shin had admitted several inaccuracies including the length of time he spent in camp fourteen
shin's high profile role and now admitted inconsistencies in his story raised concerns that it could undermine human rights advocacy efforts and distract from testimonies by other north korean refugees
there are a lot of people who actually have been to the camp and experienced it
it will be wrong for their witness accounts to lose credibility because of this incident said ahn myeong chul a former north korean camp guard who knows shin
peter jung director of the human rights group justice for north korea said he's worried that people testifying about north korea will be called a liar but that shin's new revelations can't challenge the fact that north korea control camps exist
jung said that many north korean refugees such as shin suffer from major trauma after escaping the regime and called for support
i hope he gathers his courage and tells his story accurately and honestly and we must help him do that
north korean memoirs and testimonies can not be verified there are no paper trails and investigators can not interview or access witnesses in a closed society
their stories are compared for consistency with other defectors and experts but the process is far from foolproof
cnn has not been able to reach shin who noted in his social media apology that these will be my final words and this will likely be my final post
shin's admission of inaccuracies comes at a time of unparalleled attention on north korea's human rights record following a landmark u.n. commission of inquiry report listing abuses of the pyongyang regime
while escape from camp fourteen was not the sole reason for the creation of the commission navi pillay then the u.n. high commissioner for human rights urged the probe after meeting shin and another north korean prison camp survivor in december two thousand and twelve
since the commission report's release in two thousand and fourteen the u.n. general assembly has called for more sanctions and a referral of those responsible to the international criminal court
the matter remains at the u.n. security council where it's likely china would block referrals of kim jong un and his leadership to the international criminal court
michael kirby chairman of the commission of inquiry into north korea said that shin's testimony consisted of only two paragraphs in the four hundred page report and that he was only one of hundreds of north korean witnesses
it's a very small part of a very long story
and it really doesn't affect the credibility of the testimony which is online he said
lots of people took part this inquiry
their stories are powerful and convincing and these stories do not only represent shin but other people in north korea
in a reversal of his story told for years shin told harden on friday that he had been transferred to another prison camp eighteen when he was six instead of spending his entire life inside north korea at the total control zone camp fourteen the author says on his website
the distinction of whether shin was imprisoned in camp fourteen or eighteen was not a deal breaker for kirby
it seems as if the issue is whether he was in the total control zone or whether he was in an ordinary prison camp
in another words it's whether triple horror or double horror kirby said
shin bears the physical scars of torture including a missing fingertip and burn marks on his back according to the book
and harden noted in his book that during the interview process shin at times was unreliable and in many crucial instances corrected his korean memoir an autobiography that shin wrote in two thousand and seven called escape to the outside world which was only published in korean
north korea had sought to discredit shin
last fall a pro north korea government website released videos with english subtitles featuring a man whom shin recognized to be his father disputing the story that his son was ever in a prison camp
shin responded with a statement accusing the government of holding my father hostage
it's unclear if the video had any bearing on the timing of shin's admission
ahn the former prison camp guard who has known shin for seven years said he believes the crux of shin's story is true and that torture in either camp is still the same
shin became an icon for north korean human rights
whether he was in camp fourteen or camp eighteen he is definitely a person from a political prison camp
he was born there and tortured there


swiss pilots bertrand piccard and andre borschberg announced the solar impulse two aircraft will depart the united arab emirates on their historic adventure in late february or early march making a total of twelve planned stops
the route includes landings in myanmar
china
india
phoenix arizona
and new york's john f. kennedy international airport
at speeds between fifty and one hundred kilometers per hour piccard and borschberg aim to circle the globe flying about twenty five days over a total of about five months
an earlier version of the plane was the first solar powered aircraft of perpetual endurance to fly day and night without a drop of fuel according to its website thanks to advanced solar cells that charge light weight lithium batteries
the batteries are able to store enough energy to allow the plane to fly long distances at night
developers say solar impulse two takes what engineers learned from its predecessor and pushes it a step further
compare the aircraft's wingspan to a giant boeing seven hundred and forty seven eight
solar impulse two is twelve feet wider at two hundred and thirty six feet
and it's very lightweight just two tons lighter than a large suv
with just one seat designers acknowledge solar impulse two isn't commercially practical
but that's not the point
instead engineers aim to demonstrate the possibilities of solar powered aviation and to promote clean energy technology
soon the plane's unique silhouette may be visible across the horizons of southern europe africa asia and north america
cities on the planned route include the chinese communities of chongqing and nanjing as well as ahmedabad and varanasi in india
the pilots have already set a few solar aviation records
in two thousand and ten with borschberg in the cockpit a previous solar impulse became the first manned plane to fly for twenty four hours on nothing but solar powered batteries
the team followed that up in two thousand and twelve when the plane flew from spain to morocco making it the first manned sun powered plane to fly to another continent
and in two thousand and thirteen piccard and borschberg flew an earlier version of solar impulse on a mission across the united states
piccard is a bona fide adventurer with world records to prove it
decades after pioneering ultralight aircraft in the one thousand nine hundred and seventy s piccard and his colleague brian jones were the first to circle the earth nonstop in a balloon in one thousand nine hundred and ninety nine
their gondola is displayed at the smithsonian
breaking barriers is a piccard family tradition
his grandfather explored the stratosphere in a pressurized chamber carried by a balloon
ten miles high he was the first human to see the curvature of the planet with his own eyes
piccard's father plumbed the pacific taking a special submarine to a record setting depth of nearly seven miles
borschberg came to the project with more than two decades as a swiss air force fighter pilot

it's a weekday morning at yujiapu financial district in the chinese city of tianjin

every week inside africa takes its viewers on a journey across africa exploring the true diversity and depth of different cultures countries and regions
whether they draw from their colonial past independence or the turbulent years of civil war that followed many mozambicans have taken to the canvas to express themselves
it's no wonder the mozambican art scene is taking the world by storm
for goncalo mabunda the sixteen year civil war that ended in one thousand nine hundred and ninety two provided not only the muse but the materials for his works
his sculptures intricate masks thrones and figurines are molded from recovered weaponry and military equipment namely old landmines ak forty seven s and rocket launchers
mabunda's work was made possible through the efforts of the christian council of mozambique a group of local churches that launched the transforming guns into hoes program which offers participants tools and building materials in exchange for recovered weapons
the war is over
why do we still need weapons 
let's destroy
and i'm glad the government at the time said yes let's destroy 
for other artists like naguib elias abdula whose half mile murals are dotted throughout the landscape of maputo the country's capital independence was the spark plug that got him painting
in one thousand nine hundred and seventy five when mozambique became its own country following a decade long insurrection against portugal the land was covered in debris and was very much a blank canvas
for abdula artwork proved the perfect medium to inform the public
at the time it was necessary to teach the people what's going on
what is independence 
what is mozambique 
it was necessary to teach people and people didn't read so we taught through paintings in the road he says referring to the low literacy rate back then
like mabunda abdula's work has achieved international acclaim following an exhibit at the united nation's headquarters in one thousand nine hundred and ninety six
since he's been shown in countries throughout the world
it is a narrative that is becoming popular in the country which has started to gain a reputation as an incubator of fine arts
there is an artistic movement confirms arturo vicente president of maputo's nucleo di arte a longstanding exhibition space that showcases many of the country's up and coming artists

a small group of german tourists is trapped inside
the bargain priced apartment they've been renting maybe doesn't seem like such a good deal now
there's no word of when a maintenance engineer will show up or even if such a person exists
this is clearly no intellectual's ivory tower
and that's just the way cuban author pedro juan gutierrez likes it
up here i'm like a ghost
i've been a privileged witness to what has gone on in the neighborhood he told me on a recent visit to his home
gutierrez has been living on the top floor for more than thirty years now
he's transformed a small roof terrace into his own observation platform to peer down on what he calls central havana's dirty reality
these days gutierrez says he's turned to buddhism to beat his addictions to cheap rum and wild sex
up in his ninth floor sanctuary he's just about out of harm's way
but one teeter and he may just fall he says maybe he'll join me for a small drink down at ground level in the next few days
gutierrez has rarely been so clean living
he says he's spent most of the last three decades prowling the streets and alleys below
things are continually happening down there
pornographic erotic sociological and anthropological happenings he explained wide eyed
gutierrez's almost twenty works of prose and poetry are foul mouthed cynical and scathing
the kinder literary critics have dubbed him the pioneer of dirty realism
his worst critics have condemned him as a crude pornographer for example before you even finish the first page of his acclaimed dirty trilogy of havana there are graphic sexual scenes
some people accuse me of exaggerating but i say no
the reality is excessive
i have to tone things down to make it believable
it's a very brutal violent reality and in order to make it credible you have to tone it down a bit he says
but i am interested in ugliness the ethics and the aesthetics of the dirty ones the poorest people who live right on the edge he adds
his bleakest works are centered on the one thousand nine hundred and ninety s during cuba's so called special period
that was just after the soviet union collapsed leaving its caribbean ally cuba to economic wrack and ruin devoid of subsidies or a market for its goods
but gutierrez says not a lot has improved since then at least in central and old havana
everything has stayed the same here
the same poverty the same misery the same people who are just survivors he said
i write about people surviving on the limits
jabbing his finger into the afternoon sun gutierrez points out neptuno colon trocadero and san lazaro the four streets that he says once formed cuba's largest red light district before the one thousand nine hundred and fifty nine revolution
he suggests that prostitution migration from the countryside to the capital and the disintegration of extended families are the root causes of the chaos he says still reigns in this area
there were hundreds or thousands of hookers down there
the people left there today are the daughters and the granddaughters of the hookers
that's important to note in social terms
this was never a normal neighborhood he explained with a grin
gutierrez worked for twenty six years as a journalist for state run newspapers and magazines
but when he began publishing his crude and critical brand of fiction he was fired
he's pushed the boundaries of free speech in cuba but has never been jailed for speaking his mind
he seems to have little intention of keeping quiet
i'm soon going to be sixty five
i have to take advantage of those years to say what i have to say
people don't dare
they just die with their mouths shut
when you have ideas you have to express them gutierrez said
his literary depiction of his neighbors here in central havana may seem harsh
but walking the streets you can quickly see he may have a valid point
a few doors from his apartment building there's the entrance to the local revolutionary defense committee a neighborhood group set up to promote the values of the revolution
on the door a black and white photo of a young fidel castro
diagonally opposite is a small store with welded bars at the window
the only thing inside a huge vat of white rum
a half measure sells for forty cents and a full seven hundred and fifty ml goes for eighty cents
it was only mid morning but a man rooted through the trash outside pulled out a small plastic bottle and with trembling hands asked for a fill up
that surely can not be what castro enshrined in the poster across the street had in mind
a land where tourists drink mint filled mojitos while a few blocks away an alcoholic worker knocks back a huge slug of train sparks the name cubans colloquially give to cheap industrial strength rum
this neighborhood always was on the margins of all the talk of revolutionary ideals
maybe in the seventies and eighties when there was some kind of revolutionary pride it was a little different
but generally people stayed on the sidelines gutierrez told me
while his works are bitingly critical of the decades long social breakdown in his neighborhood his overall outlook on life and the cuban system is more nuanced
when castro and his rebels seized power in one thousand nine hundred and fifty nine gutierrez was seven years old selling ice cream on havana's streets
he recalls the brutality of the outgoing dictatorship of general fulgencio batista and the celebrations and hopes for newfound freedom ushered in by the rebel forces
there was a lot of joy in the first few days
it was like freedom had arrived he said
despite the experiences of the decades since then gutierrez says he still considers himself a romantic leftist
he rejects suggestions that he has anything in common with cuba's right wing dissident movement
i think is trying to save the good things of socialism and the revolution like education health and national pride
we still have to advance a great deal in human rights and personal freedoms he added
for some of gutierrez's neighbors change can not come fast enough
it's past midnight in a dive bar on galliano street
a washed up boxer agustin croons along to a salsa tune on the tv then asks for a double strength rum and coke
he says he was a bantamweight olympic and pan american games champion
when it comes to boxers cuba has proved itself to be in a sporting class of its own
but now fifty agustin has little left to show for his glory years except for a nose like a lump of rubber broken so many times he has no cartilage left
in a hotel bar a few doors down on havana's malecon waterfront a thirty three year old woman clad in leopard print hot pants sips on a cristal beer and strikes up a conversation
she says police once gave her a ticket for harassing tourists official speak for prostitution
she says her day job is a physical education teacher for primary school children
she earns just ten dollar a month with her state salary and spends that in the bat of one of her false eyelashes
but she says the job provides her with a vital cover story
having legitimate employment she says keeps her out of trouble with the law when she turns tricks at night
she charges her foreign clients one hundred dollar a night if they don't bargain her down she says
like many others she has high hopes that she will be able to cash in on the potential influx of american tourists after president barack obama's announcement of more stable u.s. cuba relations
but back up the street gutierrez is not convinced there will be a quick fix to those relations
the problem he says are elderly cubans on both sides of the florida straits
for more than half a century there's been a lot of hatred between cubans in the u.s. and those on the island
there's been a lot of thirst for revenge
we have to wait for the years to pass and the old men to die he says
only then can we resolve things in a civilized way



cuban author pedro juan gutierrez has spent three decades watching and writing about the streets of what he calls central havana's dirty reality


the aircraft's cockpit voice recorder which captures all noises on the flight deck was recovered last week from the depths of the java sea along with the other so called black box the flight data recorder
the voice from the cockpit does not show any sign of a terrorist attack
it is only the pilot sounding very busy andreas hananto an investigator at indonesia's national transportation safety committee said in an interview with the news agency reuters
he said monday that investigators had heard no threats in the recordings
we didn't hear any voice of other persons other than the pilots nurcahyo utomo another investigator told reuters
but it remains a mystery what brought down the aircraft on december twenty eight as it flew from the indonesian city of surabaya toward singapore with one hundred and sixty two people on board
flight qz eight thousand five hundred and one was traveling through an area of heavy thunderstorms when it crashed
the pilot requested permission to turn and climb to a higher altitude because of the weather before contact was lost with air traffic control according to indonesian officials
was weather mechanical failure or human error to blame 
investigators have to be very careful before they make any definitive calls according to christopher voss a former fbi agent who investigated the crash of twa flight eight hundred off the coast of new york in one thousand nine hundred and ninety six
you want to make absolutely certain before you rule anything in for sure or rule anything out for sure he told cnn
investigators need to identify whether the crash was caused by a problem that could affect other flight crews or aircraft voss said
while transportation officials focus on figuring out what happened search teams are still looking for most of the bodies of the people who were on board the plane
more than three weeks after the crash the remains of fifty three people have been recovered some of them still strapped into seats
many of the rest could be in the wreckage of the fuselage which searchers located last week at the bottom of the sea
but their efforts to examine and get inside the wreckage have been hindered by high waves and strong currents
the divers couldn't even reach the bottom which hampered our operation supriyadi an operations coordinator for indonesia's search and rescue agency told reporters
they did managed to recover a few bits of debris from the area including passenger windows and seats airasia said in a statement
search officials have said they are considering using giant balloons to lift the roughly one hundred foot long fuselage from the seafloor to the surface as they did with the tail section of the aircraft earlier this month

the foreign ministry in beijing responded monday to the publication by german magazine der spiegel of new documents purportedly from nsa leaker edward snowden
the ministry's spokesperson hong lei told reporters monday that he wondered if his country's accusers could produce any evidence to support their claims
cyber attacks are hard to trace back and are usually committed across borders
this complexity means that it is extremely difficult to identify the source of the attacks
one document reveals that u.s. authorities believe china stole many terabytes of data related to its new state of the art f thirty five fighter jet including detailed engine schematics and radar design
cnn has not been able to independently confirm the authenticity of the document
the chinese are currently designing their own stealth fighter aircraft the fc thirty one which analysts have noted resembles the f thirty five
according to reuben f. johnson a correspondent for ihs jane's defence weekly the fc thirty one looks stealthy and its shape mimics that of the f thirty five in some respects but it's questionable whether it rivals its american counterpart from a performance and technological point of view
a data breach impacting defense contractor lockheed martin the maker of the f thirty five was originally reported in two thousand and nine
the company told cnn at the time that to its knowledge no highly classified information had been accessed
it declined to comment on the latest documents

the president has no control minister of information nadia sakkaf told cnn as clashes raged
president abdu rabu mansour hadi was thought to be in his private residence at the time not in the palace
there were reports of clashes near the residence
and the prime minister's residence was under attack from the street sakkaf said
the regime still controlled the city of aden and it closed the port of aden as well as roads leading into and out of sanaa according to yemeni state tv which is controlled by the government
the global stakes are high
yemen is home to al qaeda in the arabian peninsula or aqap the terror network linked to such attacks as the recent slaughter at french satirical publication charlie hebdo
aqap also tried to blow up a plane landing in detroit in two thousand and nine
the battle against aqap has helped make yemen's government a u.s. ally in the fight against al qaeda
a power vacuum often benefits terrorist groups
the yemeni government has been grappling with pressure not only from the sunni muslim aqap but also from houthi militants shiite muslims who have long felt marginalized in the majority sunni country
seven things to know about yemen
we are the victims of corruption and false promises houthi rebel leader abdul malik al houthi said in a televised address on a network controlled by houthis and based in beirut lebanon
the government did not respect the peace and partnership deal from september
we are trying to bring some legitimacy to the government
he complained of economic struggles and poverty
al houthi also said there is an international conspiracy to link yemen to the attacks in paris
yemeni people have two options to move against the foreign agendas or stand against them firmly since they seek to spread chaos in yemen
this is why we moved with the yemeni people though many powers inside and outside yemen are angered
but the yemeni people are with us and understand our goals he said
aqap claimed responsibility for the charlie hebdo attack and u.s. investigators have worked on the assumption that attacker said kouachi met the late american terrorist cleric anwar al awlaki at some point in yemen and received orders from aqap a u.s. official told cnn
tuesday's developments came a day after heavy fighting between government forces and houthis left nine people dead and sixty seven others injured yemen's health ministry said before the sides agreed to a ceasefire
gunfire could be heard sporadically across sanaa on tuesday
unknown assailants fired shots monday night at a u.s. embassy vehicle in sanaa the u.s. embassy said tuesday
the shooters fired first into the air and then turned the guns on the vehicle the embassy said
the vehicle carried u.s. diplomatic personnel and was at a checkpoint near the embassy at the time
no injuries were reported
the embassy is known to use suvs that are recognizable as u.s. government vehicles
two u.s. navy warships moved into new positions in the red sea late monday to be ready to evacuate americans from the embassy if needed a u.s. official with direct knowledge of the planning told cnn
u.n. secretary general ban ki moon called on all sides to immediately cease all hostilities exercise maximum restraint and take the necessary steps to restore full authority to the legitimate government institutions
members of the u.n. security council were briefed by the u.n. special adviser on yemen jamal benomar and later issued a statement expressing their concern about the crisis
they stressed that hadi is the country's legitimate authority
the members of the security council emphasized that all parties and political actors in yemen must stand with president hadi prime minister bahah and yemen's cabinet to keep the country on track to stability and security the statement read
houthis swept into the capital last year sparking battles that left more than three hundred dead in a month
in september they signed a ceasefire deal with the government and houthis have since installed themselves in key positions in the government and financial institutions
but tensions flared again last weekend as houthis said they abducted presidential chief of staff ahmed bin mubarak in sanaa on saturday
osama sari senior media adviser to the houthi movement in yemen said houthis detained bin mubarak because the president wanted to introduce a new constitution without the houthis approval

the children along with teachers and activists were demonstrating after the playground was walled off during the holidays said boniface mwangi who participated in the protest
the playground near the langata primary school had reportedly been confiscated for the construction of a parking lot
video showed students and activists pushing kicking and hitting the wall with planks of wood
children wearing their green school sweaters held signs calling the seizure of the playground terror against children and kenya the land of shameless grabbers
some of the students taking part were as young as six mwangi said
riot police responded to the demonstration by unleashing plumes of tear gas that sent the children fleeing in panic
as news of the police's actions spread thousands of people voiced anger on social media using the hashtag occupyplayground
children were promised laptops not canisters of tear gas tweeted former kenyan vice president kalonzo musyoka
someone must be held accountable
some children were treated in hospital after the incident mwangi said
at least one police officer was also hurt
kenyan media reported that the police officer in charge of the operation at the playground has been suspended
police didn't respond to cnn's request for comment
some people on social media blamed the adult activists for the chaotic scenes
what has occupyplayground achieved apart from crying terrorised children activists pushing agenda via kids 
wrote a twitter user on the handle snrmbatha
this is kids action he said
they want back their playground and they came back to get their playground
the children were set to go back to school tuesday
but not without the memory of what mwangi called a dark sad day for kenya

the else being that the pair will meet the same gruesome fate as other captives held by the terrorist group others who were shown in isis videos kneeling in orange jumpsuits in front of masked black clad men just like the japanese hostages identified as kenji goto jogo and haruna yukawa shortly before being beheaded
in the latest video a masked man gives the japanese government a choice to pay two hundred million dollar the same amount of money prime minister shinzo abe recently pledged for those contending with isis to free the japanese men
that deal holds for seventy two hours which would seem to mean sometime friday since the video appeared on social media tuesday
another move that theoretically could change things would be if japan's government halts its alliance with those fighting isis which calls itself the islamic state
tokyo hasn't participated in airstrikes aimed at the islamist extremist group though its leaders have supported those who have as well as the iraqi government
although you are more than eight thousand five hundred kilometers away from the islamic state you willingly volunteered to take part in this crusade the masked man on the video posted tuesday says addressing his comments to abe
but abe who is visiting the middle east didn't seem about to bargain tuesday
he stood by a pledge made in a speech at the weekend in cairo for funding to help build human capacities infrastructure and so on for those affected by isis armed campaign
the pledge aid is very important to the refugees in need and has nothing to do with the islamic communities or the radical militants the prime minister said

we will contribute to the peace and stability in cooperation with the global community
as to the isis threat against two of his nation's citizens abe called it unacceptable
i feel angry about it he said
i strongly urge them to immediately release the hostages without harming them
isis has asked for ransoms before and apparently has been paid them
but rarely are such demands made publicly
even rarer unprecedented in fact is when the militant group puts its captives on video and threatens them then lets them go
instead isis has made a public show out of its threatening and killings of western hostages starting with august's beheading of u.s. journalist james foley
others killings were similarly recorded and posted online including american journalist steven sotloff british aid worker david haines british taxi driver alan henning and u.s. aid worker peter kassig
while not participating in ground combat both the united states and great britain have taken an active role in the anti isis fight with airstrikes and training arming and otherwise supporting groups such as iraq's military kurdish fighters and moderate syrian opposition taking on the militants face to face
that's not the case for japan whose post world war ii constitution allows it to use its military only for self defense
but tokyo is a strong ally with western powers such as the united states that have been singled out by isis
in his remarks tuesday in jerusalem abe who dealt with another hostage crisis involving islamic militants in january two thousand and thirteen when ten japanese citizens were caught up in the terrorist seizure of a natural gas facility in algeria said he had ordered japanese officials to do the utmost to try to save the two men
at the same time the prime minister added terrorists should not be forgiven for any reason
i criticize emphatically
the aim is to safely bring home two men who were in the same war torn region for very different reasons
like foley and sotloff goto went there to help tell the story of what was happening in iraq and syria
in recent months isis militants have managed to take over vast swaths of both countries ruthlessly going after many in their way who don't share their extremist interpretation of islam
the isis video refers to him as kenji goto jogo but on his twitter handle and a photograph accredited to him he's just called kenji goto
the freelance journalist reported for various japanese news organizations about the situation in the northern syrian battleground city of kobani which for weeks has been under siege by isis and other areas
while it's not known when he was taken captive goto's last twitter post was on october twenty three
the man purportedly shown along with him yukawa is believed to have been captured in syria in august while traveling with rebel fighters according to the japanese news agency kyodo
the forty two year old claimed to have set up a company in tokyo providing armed security services and posted videos online of his activities in iraq and syria
but a report by the news agency reuters in august portrayed him as a lost soul who went to the middle east searching for a purpose after losing his wife his business and his home over the previous decade
kyodo reported previously that japanese officials in jordan had being trying to secure his release including talking to various groups with possible connections to his captors
abe spoke firmly tuesday against the terrorists and their two hundred million dollar ransom demand
what he did not do however is rule out the japanese government paying ransom or negotiating with its two citizens captors
like most countries japan has never advertised that it or japanese companies have paid ransom for hostages
in fact japanese government officials have at times denied such a practice and japan is a signatory to a two thousand and thirteen g eight communique that stated we unequivocally reject the payment of ransoms to terrorists and we call on countries and companies around the world to follow our lead to stamp this out
one reason for this policy is that isis and groups like it can use ransoms to fund their bloody campaigns
paying ransoms also may give them incentive to take more hostages thus putting more people at risk
and ransoms might not always work since isis and other hostage takers aren't usually seen as trustworthy
still ruling out ransoms also rules out one peaceful way to free goto and yukawa
it's possible someone else may intervene to negotiate their release whether out of goodwill or in exchange for something else
or troops from a japanese ally could launch a raid to get to them like the unsuccessful one this summer to free foley
either way others could play a role in this story before it's done hence abe's comment tuesday that the international community needs to deal with terrorists without giving in to them

i have just spoken with the national defense and security council secretary
ukrainian military intelligence confirm the fact military personnel and equipment have been transferred from russia to ukraine the prime minister is quoted as saying
he continued
tanks grad multiple rocket systems buk and smerch systems radio electronic intelligence systems are not sold at local donetsk street markets
only the russian army and defense ministry have them
the prime minister's spokeswoman olga lappo confirmed to cnn the quotes attributed to yatsenyuk are accurate
russian officials could not be immediately reached for a response
the report came a day after protesters gathered at kiev's independence square to march for peace
yatsenyuk and ukraine's president were among those who attended the rally which had as its slogan i am volnovakha in memory of the thirteen passengers who died near the city of volnovakha after their bus was hit by artillery fire on january thirteen
we will remember every ukrainian hero who gave for the sake of independence sovereignty and territorial integrity of ukraine president petro poroshenko said
we will not give up a single meter of our land
meanwhile fighting in the east continued
government forces and pro russia rebels have been battling for control of the eastern donetsk and luhansk regions since april after russia annexed ukraine's southeastern crimea region the previous month

muslim owned houses in a village in bihar state's muzaffarpur district were attacked and set on fire sunday after the body of a hindu man reported missing since january eleven was discovered in a field police spokesman gupteshwar pandey told cnn
the victim's father claimed his son was abducted for an apparent relationship with a muslim woman pandey said
at least fourteen arrests have been made so far pandey said
muslims make up almost thirteen percents of india's one point two billion mainly hindu population
but the two communities have a history of violent occasionally deadly clashes
in two thousand and two more than fifty people were killed in the western state of gujarat after a train carrying hindu pilgrims was set alight allegedly by local muslims
eleven people were sentenced to death and twenty others were jailed for life for their roles in the attack which sparked days of rioting across the region that left more than one thousand people dead
in september two thousand and thirteen more than sixty people most of them muslim died during sectarian rioting in the muzaffarnagar district of uttar pradesh state

his family and friends were stunned
one friend told the local newspaper sudinfo
he doesn't even speak arabic very well
on friday the day after belgian police killed two extremists during a raid in verviers a cnn crew met hagaoui's mother and sister at her home just a few hundred yards from the scene of the shoot out
at the time belgian media were suggesting he may have returned to verviers and been killed in the police raid
they were too upset to talk
at that moment they had no idea whether redouane was alive or dead
the imam of the local mosque franck hensch told cnn they had not seen redouane since two thousand and thirteen
he had been a serious but kind boy and had worked in a local restaurant the imam said
hensch and the president of the mosque m'hamed bouchlagham said that extremism was not common among muslims in verviers but that fewer young people were attending the mosque and instead were being influenced elsewhere
while the identities of the two men killed in the police raid have not been disclosed it now seems hagaoui is still alive and likely still in syria or iraq one of dozens of young belgian men and women who have left their dreary industrial towns to wage jihad in iraq and syria
a recent study by the brookings institution in washington estimated that at least two hundred and fifty individuals have left belgium fewer than the number from britain and france but the highest in europe when measured per capita
other sources put the number above three hundred
one of them posted a photograph of himself brandishing an automatic weapon and with an ammunition belt round his neck
calling himself fayssal oussaih he said he came from maaseik a small town on the dutch border
he was reportedly the fourth resident of maaseik to leave for syria
another belgian jihadist with a high profile is abdelhamid abaaoud a twenty seven year old belgian of moroccan descent from a suburb of brussels
an isis video posted in march last year shows him in a truck towing four dead bodies away in the aftermath of a massacre
abaaoud's thirteen year old brother also arrived in syria later to become reputedly the youngest foreign fighter there
belgian analyst and historian pieter van ostaeyen says jihadists help each other with travel advice through social media
one posted on facebook
everything you need is available here be it clothes or things for your home we have everything
and a tip
don't behave like a warrior
shave your beards behave like tourists and buy tickets back and forth
precise figures on the number of europeans who have gone to iraq and syria and which groups they have joined are hard to come by
the consensus among counter terrorism analysts is that more than three thousand have traveled of whom five hundred have returned including up to seventy who have come back to belgium
of those who have gone there appears to have been a sharp shift toward joining the islamic state in iraq and syria in the last year
van ostaeyen writes
if there is one important difference between those who left during the first wave and the second it would be their favor to fight for the islamic state
and isis has made it clear it plans to send fighters to europe once western forces are in its words defeated in iraq and syria
an outlawed group called sharia four belgium is suspected of arranging the travel of some would be jihadists
nearly fifty of its members are currently on trial in antwerp but almost all are being tried in absentia
guy van vlierden an investigative journalist with belgian newspaper het laatste nieuws who tracks jihadist networks told cnn that sharia four belgium had disbanded because of prosecutions and the flow of members to syria
as an informal network though i think it still exists
and from time to time people try some kind of relaunch van vlierden said
one of the group that went to fight is azeddine kbir bounekoub a belgian moroccan from antwerp in his twenties who is believed to be in raqqa isis's self declared capital and has a facebook page in the name of abu gastbijshaam
after the attack on a jewish museum in belgium by a gunman accused of allegiance to isis he wrote on facebook page
may allah raise up more young people who take the example of those who committed the attack in the jewish museum
analysts of islamist extremism in europe talk of a third generation muslim teenagers and men in their early twenties intensely alienated from the countries to which their parents and grandparents immigrated in hope of a better life
a significant minority among them feel marginalized within their own country and are enticed by isis's slick multilingual propaganda machine
some even see the kouachi brothers who attacked the offices of charlie hebdo in paris as heroes
there were a number of incidents in french schools when the minute's silence for the victims was interrupted
one college teacher in a suburb of paris with a high muslim population told cnn that since the paris attacks some muslim students had adopted the slogan jesuiskouachi as a riposte to jesuischarlie
few of them will ever pack their bags but they could easily be further radicalized at home
most of those who do make it to syria are raw recruits with few skills
but they learn fast and one worrying dimension of the conflict to western analysts is the coming together of this third generation with veteran jihadists men like abdelkader hakimi
now forty eight hakimi left prison in two thousand and eleven after serving a long terror sentence
he is thought to have trained in afghanistan and as a young man had been condemned to death in his native morocco for trying to overthrow the monarchy
on facebook last year he suggested he was in aleppo syria
his current whereabouts are unknown
while european intelligence agencies scramble to tackle the first wave of returnees some analysts offer a few crumbs of comfort
among the hundreds who have followed their dream of jihad some never imagine returning home
yilmaz a young dutchman and former soldier told a dutch television network that he did not expect to come home far less commit an attack in holland
others are killed or become suicide bombers
a few return home disillusioned with the violence
the brookings study says the threat posed by foreign fighters could be reduced by better co operation among european intelligence services
intelligence from the communications of foreign fighters shared open source monitoring and other information obtained by one service can prove crucial for discovering transnational networks it says
van vlierden says that given their modest resources the belgian security services have been pioneers in tracking fighters
i truly think for example that the jewish museum attack wouldn't have happened with a perpetrator from belgium itself he told cnn
four people were shot dead at the museum in brussels last year
the alleged assailant a french national named mehdi nemmouche was arrested in france highlighting the additional problem posed by europe's open borders
twenty six european states are part of the schengen agreement which abolished passport and immigration controls between signatories
in paris analysts and former officers in the security services have long been critical of the lack of collaboration between france's police and the domestic and foreign intelligence services in the wake of the paris attacks
that lack of communication became apparent after the toulouse shootings in two thousand and twelve when mohamed merah killed seven people across several days in toulouse
governments in northern europe now face threats on multiple fronts from loosely organized cells with ready access to weapons and in many cases the expertise to use them
last july chams eddine zaougui and peter van ostaeyen warned in the new york times that policy makers unrealistic obsession with foreign fighters could be a distraction from a more serious domestic terrorist threat
the unfortunate lesson to be drawn from recent events in paris and belgium is that policy makers now need to focus on both


the shenzhen evening news issued an apology on sunday on their official sina weibo account a widely used chinese social media site confirming the incident
we sincerely apologize for the disturbance and discomfort we have caused to yao's family fans and netizens the statement read
the newspaper admitted to taking photos of the thirty three year old's body during a cornea removal surgery in a operating room after her death on friday evening at a shenzhen hospital
she had agreed to donate her corneas after her death
according to the statement the photos were deleted immediately after family members objected
yao is a pop star known for singing the chinese version of let it go from disney's blockbusterfrozen
she first rose to fame in china's hit reality television singing competition the voice in two thousand and thirteen
allegations of the incident surfaced on social media a day after the news of the thirty three year old's death broke
a widely shared post on weibo under the user name entertainment whistleblower said that three journalists from the shenzhen evening news pretended to be medical staff assisting in the surgery and sneaked into the morgue to take photographs of the deceased singer's body
the statement from the newspaper did not say how many journalists were involved or detail exactly how the photos were obtained
cnn contacted the hospital about the allegations but they had no comment on the incident
the allegations unleashed a storm of criticism about media ethics on social media
where is your humanity 
commented one weibo user referring to the newspaper
a simple apology online and that's all you're going to do about an incident that seriously oversteps ethical borders 
said another



by showing students as young as six how robots can solve real world problems fundi bots founder solomon king benge wants young people to develop a creative skill set they can apply to solve issues specific to their lives
we have a team in northern uganda building an automated farming program explains thirty two year old king benge
the project includes an irrigation system for crops and also a temperature monitoring solution to make sure
cow feed doesn't overheat and go bad
the students are also working on an automatic seed dispenser to feed pigs
in a country where over ninety percents of primary school aged children are enrolled in classes according to world bank data fundi bots first focuses on extracurricular time slots in schools
as well as presentations and video based learning fundi bots also offers hands on robotics training and helps keen students form weekly robotics clubs
the initiative has taken off in fifteen schools spread across the capital kampala and gulu in the north where experienced mentors visit once or twice a month to offer ideas and encouragement
but tinkering with robotic parts and coming up with new ideas carries on after school too
during holiday camps students are taught robotic concepts and then given time to implement that learning by building a robot by the end of the camp
central to the fundi bots philosophy is that building robots does not require a fortune
students are encouraged to use recycled materials or components like laser pointers and microphones that were never originally designed to be a robotic building block
one group of thirteen and fourteen year olds is creating a small remote controlled vehicle with a temperature reader on the front that could be used in fire risk areas king benge explains
their idea uses a wireless transmitter which sends data back in real time but they managed to keep costs quite low at around one hundred and thirty dollar by using locally sourced materials like wheels from toy cars
while the physical components may not command high prices the skills students gain in the process could prove lucrative
according to eurobotics aisbl the global market for robotics amounted to twenty five point eight billion dollar in june two thousand and fourteen and is expected to grow to more than seventy billion dollar by two thousand and twenty
while the fundi bots program is showing initial signs of having an impact in uganda king benge says that's just the start
fundi bots is based in uganda but our five year mandate is to build a presence in five african countries by the end of two thousand and twenty explains king benge
the most promising country at the moment is rwanda because the government is very forward thinking and very keen to develop as the ict powerhouse in the region
fundi bots which held a workshop in rwanda last october might be the first robotics teaching program in uganda but it is not the only one of its kind in africa
the african robotics network was established in ghana in april two thousand and twelve to improve education around robotics
one way the group has worked on this goal is by organizing the week long ashesi robotics experience
it was during this set of workshops that a participant developed the lollybot a basic mini explorer robot which can navigate obstacles and learn about its surroundings
the robot which uses chupa chups lollipops in the design can be built from scratch for a total cost of just eight dollar point ninety six
the enthusiasm of the kids is incredible says ayorkor korsah assistant computer science professor at ashesi university college and co founder of the african robotics network
recognizing that a robot can be made from familiar items like a computer mouse or game controller really demystifies robotics and electronics for them
robots are also playing a more prominent role in kinshasa the capital of the democratic republic of congo
eight feet tall robotic traffic wardens designed and built by a team of local engineers have been recording and controlling traffic twenty four hours a day for just less than a year
as the ugandan students learn new ways to build robots king benge says there's no limit to what could emerge from the workshops and retreats
when i see the students coming up with innovative ideas i really see minds are being changed
students are being exposed to the creative process and i look forward to seeing them come up with bigger projects in five or ten years time

european union officials are scrambling to stop the spread of terrorism and threats with foreign ministers meeting monday in brussels belgium to tackle the issue
we start with obviously a discussion on how to counter terrorism not only in europe but also in other parts of the world said federica mogherini eu high representative for foreign affairs
she said she had just met with arab league secretary general nabil el araby as the threat is not only the one we faced in paris but also spreading in many other parts of the world starting from muslim countries
and we need to strengthen our way of cooperating together first of all with arab countries and then internally
with new developments sprouting up across europe here are the latest
the hunt is still on for the ringleader behind a terrorist cell targeted in raids last week belgium's justice minister said
the suspected leader and key link between senior isis operatives in syria and the belgian terrorist cell belgian moroccan isis fighter abelhamid abaaoud is still at large a senior belgian counterterrorism official said
abaaoud's last known location was believed to be greece the official said
an algerian national who may have links to abaaoud was arrested over the weekend in greece and is being extradited to belgium
the man detained by belgian police after last week's raid has been identified
his attorney says he isn't a terrorist
he was just delivering shoes to a friend when he was caught in the wrong place at the wrong time
but investigators believe the man played a key role in the terrorist cell's plot the belgian counterterrorism official said
investigators are looking for a man whose dna was found on a gun magazine used by amedy coulibaly who killed four hostages at a kosher supermarket in paris
sales of counterfeit goods by charlie hebdo attacker cherif kouachi helped fund the purchase of weapons a source familiar with the ongoing investigation in france told cnn
five belgian nationals have been charged with participation in a terrorist organization in connection with last week's raid in verviers federal prosecutor eric van der sypt said
the terror cell planned to target police officers he said
belgian counterterrorism agencies think the suspected ringleader of the cell is likely abaaoud the senior belgian counterterrorism official said
according to guy van vlierden a reporter at the belgian newspaper hln who tracks belgian foreign fighters in syria for the blog emmejihad abaaoud is a twenty seven year old from the molenbeek district of brussels who traveled to syria in january two thousand and fourteen and joined isis soon afterward
the two gunmen killed in the verviers raid belgians of north african descent from the same brussels district were in phone contact with an isis ringleader in greece who belgian authorities believe was likely abaaoud
but belgian authorities have not ruled out the possibility that an algerian suspect arrested in greece over the weekend was the key link between the terror cell and isis
that thirty three year old suspect was wanted in belgium on charges of terrorist activity greek police said monday
belgium is requesting an extradition
and greece isn't done yet
police there say they have made multiple arrests and are looking for more suspects
other countries are also helping belgium nab suspected jihadists
french authorities captured two suspects as they were trying to cross from france into italy van der sypt said
four days after police raided a suspected terror cell in verviers belgium killing two people who authorities said were part of a terrorist cell on the brink of a major attack we now know the name of the surviving suspect
marouane el bali was taken into custody and faces charges of participation in a terrorist organization and possession of explosives with intent to commit a criminal attack among other charges said his attorney didier de quvy
but de quvy said his client was not involved in any terrorism
he went to verviers to see his fiance and was dropping off a pair of sneakers de quvy said
he did not know that these guys were connected to international terrorism
he arrived he sat down and the moment he sat down the policemen starting shooting
he managed to escape by jumping out the window
the other two however took their guns and responded and got killed
authorities say it wasn't just a case of being in the wrong place at the wrong time
investigators believe el bali played a key role in the terrorist cell's plot and was a key intermediary between two dead gunmen and a wider network in brussels the senior belgian counterterrorism official said
el bali is also believed to have fought with isis in syria at some point
there are still concerns that part of the terror cell remains at large in belgium and could take revenge for the death of their comrades the senior counterterrorism official said
belgian security services suspect around ten people were involved in the cell but they don't know the number for sure and that worries them
belgian counterterrorism officials believe the cell had ambitious attack plans beyond attacking police given bomb making chemicals found in their safe house in verviers and police uniforms
they also suspect terrorists were plotting multiple attacks
the belief is that the cell has now been disrupted and will take some time to get back on its feet
the wider cell was being monitored for less than two months
over the last several weeks belgian security services started monitoring the verviers group twenty four seven
why did police move in last week 
one reason the official said is that the cell obtained weapons and belgian police could not continue round the clock surveillance indefinitely
investigators say dna found in a car used to transport jewish market attack gunman coulibaly has been traced to a man who is already in custody in connection with the attacks according to a source familiar with the ongoing investigation
investigators are still looking for a person whose dna was found on a magazine for coulibaly's gun
coulibaly is the gunman who killed four hostages on january nine at a kosher grocery store in paris before police killed him
before the siege he had proclaimed his allegiance to the islamic state in iraq and syria or isis
the assault happened during three days of terror in france that began with the attack on offices of the charlie hebdo satirical newspaper in paris
in all twelve people died in the charlie hebdo attack on january seven
al qaeda in the arabian peninsula al qaeda's yemen affiliate claimed responsibility for the charlie hebdo shootings
on monday cnn affiliate bfmtv reported charlie hebdo cartoonist laurent sourisseau will succeed editor stephane charbonnier who died in the attack
although french officials said they thought cherif kouachi had given up terror related activities and moved to end surveillance on him after he began selling counterfeit goods it turns out the proceeds from those sales were being used to buy weapons a source familiar with the ongoing investigation in france told cnn
that's just one of several missteps by intelligence agencies in france being revealed by the investigation into the attacks the source said
other failings include a lack of communication and delays in circulating information according to the source
in one case a french surveillance agency received an alert about one of the kouachi brothers phones in february two thousand and fourteen but it took four months for information to be passed on to the country's main domestic spy agency the source said
by then neither brother was under surveillance the source said
the surveillance on cherif kouachi ended in november two thousand and thirteen. the surveillance on said kouachi the older brother ended in june sources have told cnn
also authorities now say they think both said and cherif kouachi traveled to yemen in two thousand and eleven via oman even though cherif's passport had been confiscated in two thousand and ten
however investigators have been unable to find either brother's name in travel databases according to the source

on sunday hours before he was set to testify before the national congress about his allegation he was found dead in his apartment the country's ministry of security said monday
nisman fifty one who had been investigating the jewish community center bombing that occurred more than twenty years ago was found in his bathroom with a twenty two caliber gun and shell casing nearby the ministry said
no cause of death has been released but according to the buenos aires herald security secretary sergio berni and anibal fernndez secretary general to the presidency said there are signs that nisman's death was a suicide
the forensic investigation is crucial
in forensic science when you have a body a cartridge and a weapon everything leads to one place berni said according to the newspaper
we have to wait for the judicial to confirm
buenos aires police will conduct tests on nisman's hands to see if there is gunpowder on them the state run telam news agency reported
such a test would be necessary to determine whether he committed suicide
as the days go by and we have the results from the autopsy we will be able to determine the cause of death
i can't venture a hypothesis
that wouldn't be prudent viviana fein the federal prosecutor leading the investigation into nisman's death told reporters in buenos aires
i can confirm that there was a gun a twenty two caliber gun
i can confirm that he died due to a gunshot
i can not confirm further details
i will find those out in the coming days
the prosecutor had been under the protection of a ten man security detail members of which belonged to the federal police
the detail called his secretary sunday afternoon to say he wasn't answering his phone telam reported
when he didn't answer his doorbell and his sunday newspaper was found on his doorstep the security detail reached out to his family
the detail took nisman's mother to his apartment in le parc tower a high rise in the puerto madero neighborhood of buenos aires and upon finding the door locked from the inside with the key still in the lock nisman's relatives reached out to a locksmith the agency reported
nisman's mother and a guard later found the prosecutor's body blocking a bathroom door inside his room telam said
nisman was set to testify to lawmakers behind closed doors on a report alleging that president cristina fernndez de kirchner foreign minister hctor timerman and other officials had covered up iran's involvement in the bombing of the argentine israelite mutual association building
the attack killed eighty five people and wounded more than three hundred
fernndez de kirchner and timerman wanted to cover up iran's involvement in order to boost trade specifically oil imports and grain exports with the islamic republic nisman alleged last week according to the herald
chief of the cabinet of ministers jorge capitanich told cnn and other media outlets that nisman's allegation is crazy absurd illogical irrational ridiculous unconstitutional
timerman also formally rejected the accusations last week
appointed in two thousand and four by fernndez de kirchner's late husband then president nstor kirchner nisman told members of the argentine opposition that he had documents to back his allegations the herald reported
he was also expected to divulge sources for his research
congresswoman patricia bullrich who represents buenos aires in the national congress lower house and who organized the hearing said she spoke with nisman on saturday
he said he was very threatened and he knew that this was a very heavy topic she said
i am very dismayed
argentine prosecutors have long accused iran of involvement in the bombing and requested the arrest of iranian citizens in connection with it among them former defense minister ahmad vahidi former iranian president ali akbar hashemi rafsanjani and mohsen rezaie head of iran's revolutionary guard at the time of the attack
in two thousand and thirteen argentine lawmakers approved the creation of a truth commission designed to investigate the bombing in conjunction with iran
the national criminal court is investigating nisman's death the security ministry said
his body has been sent to a morgue for autopsy capitanich told cnn
israel's foreign ministry in a statement to media outlets called nisman a brave and prominent jurist who fought ceaselessly for justice as he worked to expose those behind the one thousand nine hundred and ninety four attack
the state of israel voices hope that argentine authorities will continue with nisman's activities and make every effort to exact justice on those responsible for the terrorist attacks in argentina the statement said
the anti defamation league called for a full and transparent investigation into nisman's death which it labeled another tragic episode that will extend the decades long delays in bringing the iranian masterminds and perpetrators to justice
the timing and circumstances of mr. nisman's death coming just days after he released detailed allegations of high level government attempts to evade his investigation and hours before he was scheduled to present additional details to members of the argentine congress raise serious questions about whether mr. nisman's death was related to his work on the amia bombing adl national director abraham foxman said in a statement




so says a new report which estimates that the richest one percents will have as much wealth as the other ninety nine percents combined by next year
the richest one percents have seen their share of global wealth increase from forty four percents in two thousand and nine to forty eight percents in two thousand and fourteen oxfam says in a report monday
at that rate the wealthiest will own more than fifty percents by next year according to the report
do we really want to live in a world where the one percents own more than the rest of us combined 
asked winnie byanyima executive director of the international aid agency
byanyima will co chair the annual world economic forum in davos this week
she plans to use the platform at davos to call for urgent action on the rising inequality
the eighty richest people on the planet have the same wealth as the poorest three point five billion people the report says
the scale of global inequality is quite simply staggering
and despite the issues shooting up the global agenda the gap between the richest and the rest is widening fast she said
it is time our leaders took on the powerful vested interests that stand in the way of a fairer and more prosperous world
while one percents of the population owns forty eight percents of the world's wealth a majority of the remainder follows the same trend
of the remaining fifty two percents of global wealth forty six percents is owned by the rest of the richest fifth of the world's population the report says
the remainder of the population only possesses five point five percents of global wealth
their wealth last year 
an average three thousand eight hundred and fifty one dollar per adult the report says
meanwhile the global elite members had an average wealth of two point seven million dollar each last year it says
the report comes a day before president barack obama is expected to unveil proposals that close tax breaks on the wealthy
obama will discuss his plans to help the middle class during his state of the union address on tuesday

millions of people demonstrated in condemnation of the atrocities amplified by a chorus of horror under the banner i am charlie
there were eloquent pronouncements of outrage captured well by the head of israel's labor party and the main challenger for the upcoming elections isaac herzog who declared that terrorism is terrorism
there's no two ways about it and that all the nations that seek peace and freedom face an enormous challenge from brutal violence
the crimes also elicited a flood of commentary inquiring into the roots of these shocking assaults in islamic culture and exploring ways to counter the murderous wave of islamic terrorism without sacrificing our values
the new york times described the assault as a clash of civilizations but was corrected by times columnist anand giridharadas who tweeted that it was not and never a war of civilizations or between them
but a war for civilization against groups on the other side of that line
charliehebdo
the scene in paris was described vividly in the new york times by veteran europe correspondent steven erlanger
a day of sirens helicopters in the air frantic news bulletins
of police cordons and anxious crowds
of young children led away from schools to safety
it was a day like the previous two of blood and horror in and around paris
erlanger also quoted a surviving journalist who said that everything crashed
there was no way out
there was smoke everywhere
it was terrible
people were screaming
it was like a nightmare
another reported a huge detonation and everything went completely dark
the scene erlanger reported was an increasingly familiar one of smashed glass broken walls twisted timbers scorched paint and emotional devastation
these last quotes however as independent journalist david peterson reminds us are not from january two thousand and fifteen
rather they are from a report by erlanger on april twenty four one thousand nine hundred and ninety nine which received far less attention
erlanger was reporting on the nato missile attack on serbian state television headquarters that knocked radio television serbia off the air killing sixteen journalists
nato and american officials defended the attack erlanger reported as an effort to undermine the regime of president slobodan milosevic of yugoslavia
pentagon spokesman kenneth bacon told a briefing in washington that serb tv is as much a part of milosevic's murder machine as his military is hence a legitimate target of attack
there were no demonstrations or cries of outrage no chants of we are rtv no inquiries into the roots of the attack in christian culture and history
on the contrary the attack on the press was lauded
the highly regarded u.s. diplomat richard holbrooke then envoy to yugoslavia described the successful attack on rtv as an enormously important and i think positive development a sentiment echoed by others
there are many other events that call for no inquiry into western culture and history for example the worst single terrorist atrocity in europe in recent years in july two thousand and eleven when anders breivik a christian ultra zionist extremist and islamophobe slaughtered seventy seven people mostly teenagers
also ignored in the war against terrorism is the most extreme terrorist campaign of modern times barack obama's global assassination campaign targeting people suspected of perhaps intending to harm us some day and any unfortunates who happen to be nearby
other unfortunates are also not lacking such as the fifty civilians reportedly killed in a u.s. led bombing raid in syria in december which was barely reported
one person was indeed punished in connection with the nato attack on rtv dragoljub milanovi the general manager of the station who was sentenced by the european court of human rights to ten years in prison for failing to evacuate the building according to the committee to protect journalists
the international criminal tribunal for yugoslavia considered the nato attack concluding that it was not a crime and although civilian casualties were unfortunately high they do not appear to be clearly disproportionate
the comparison between these cases helps us understand the condemnation of the new york times by civil rights lawyer floyd abrams famous for his forceful defense of freedom of expression
there are times for self restraint abrams wrote but in the immediate wake of the most threatening assault on journalism in living memory the times editors would have served the cause of free expression best by engaging in it by publishing the charlie hebdo cartoons ridiculing mohammed that elicited the assault
abrams is right in describing the charlie hebdo attack as the most threatening assault on journalism in living memory
the reason has to do with the concept living memory a category carefully constructed to include their crimes against us while scrupulously excluding our crimes against them the latter not crimes but noble defense of the highest values sometimes inadvertently flawed
this is not the place to inquire into just what was being defended when rtv was attacked but such an inquiry is quite informative
there are many other illustrations of the interesting category living memory
one is provided by the marine assault against fallujah in november two thousand and four one of the worst crimes of the u.s. uk invasion of iraq
the assault opened with occupation of fallujah general hospital a major war crime quite apart from how it was carried out
the crime was reported prominently on the front page of the new york times accompanied with a photograph depicting how patients and hospital employees were rushed out of rooms by armed soldiers and ordered to sit or lie on the floor while troops tied their hands behind their backs
the occupation of the hospital was considered meritorious and justified
it shut down what officers said was a propaganda weapon for the militants
fallujah general hospital with its stream of reports of civilian casualties
evidently this is no assault on free expression and does not qualify for entry into living memory
there are other questions
one would naturally ask how france upholds freedom of expression and the sacred principles of fraternity freedom solidarity
for example is it through the gayssot law repeatedly implemented which effectively grants the state the right to determine historical truth and punish deviation from its edicts 
by expelling miserable descendants of holocaust survivors to bitter persecution in eastern europe 
by the deplorable treatment of north african immigrants in the banlieues of paris where the charlie hebdo terrorists became jihadis 
when the courageous journal charlie hebdo fired the cartoonist sin on grounds that a comment of his was deemed to have anti semitic connotations 
many more questions quickly arise
anyone with eyes open will quickly notice other rather striking omissions
thus prominent among those who face an enormous challenge from brutal violence are palestinians once again during israel's vicious assault on gaza in the summer of two thousand and fourteen in which many journalists were murdered sometimes in well marked press cars along with thousands of others while the israeli run outdoor prison was again reduced to rubble on pretexts that collapse instantly on examination
also ignored was the assassination of three more journalists in latin america in december bringing the number for the year to thirty one
there have been more than a dozen journalists killed in honduras alone since the military coup of two thousand and nine that was effectively recognized by the u.s. probably according post coup honduras the per capita championship for murder of journalists
but again not an assault on freedom of press within living memory
it is not difficult to elaborate
these few examples illustrate a very general principle that is observed with impressive dedication and consistency
the more we can blame some crimes on enemies the greater the outrage
the greater our responsibility for crimes and hence the more we can do to end them the less the concern tending to oblivion or even denial
contrary to the eloquent pronouncements it is not the case that terrorism is terrorism
there's no two ways about it
there definitely are two ways about it
theirs versus ours
and not just terrorism

the airbus a three hundred six hundred st popularly known as the beluga because of its resemblance to the white arctic whale is the european plane manufacturer's super sized transporter jet
five of these enormous planes make more than sixty flights each week carrying parts for all of airbus planes from manufacturing sites wings in the uk tails in spain for example to the final assembly facilities in either toulouse hamburg or tianjin
the planes have been in service since one thousand nine hundred and ninety four but are in need of reinforcements
since the plane's inaugural flight airbus's production rates have increased five fold so a new fleet is planned to keep up with demand especially with the new a three hundred and fifty xwb plane now entering service
the need for the new beluga comes with the increase in production rates and to get extra capacity on top of this fleet of five aircrafts says stephane gosselin head of airbus transport international
so initially there will be a mixed fleet use of both new beluga and old beluga
and then the second need was as well to anticipate replacement of an aging fleet
a crew of three operates the beluga
two pilots and a loadmaster
because of its size the plane reacts differently to other large jets in turbulence
moving sideways more than up and down
the five belugas currently in operation are actually airbus a three hundred six hundred jets that have been modified to carry large cargo
the top section of the aircraft was cut and an additional wider fuselage section resembling a bubble was added to the airframe giving it its characteristic hump
the cockpit was lowered making it possible for the cargo hold to be loaded and unloaded through the front of the aircraft
the result is an incredibly spacious cargo hold of one thousand four hundred cubic meters
that's the equivalent to six hundred and seventy one people thirty six cars or seven elephants
the perception you have is of a huge volume like a cathedral says gosselin
although the beluga's maximum payload of forty seven tons is surpassed by a handful of other cargo aircraft its voluminous hold makes it suitable for transporting oversized but not particularly heavy cargo like aircraft parts

superjumbo on streets of tiny village
the beluga can carry the wings of an a three hundred and forty airliner or a fuselage section for airbus newest wide body aircraft the a three hundred and fifty
but it's not large enough to transport many a three hundred and eighty super jumbo parts
those need to travel by boat barge and road
with the a three hundred now out of service the new belugas will be based on the airbus a three hundred and thirty and be bigger than the existing fleet
while the current planes can only carry one wing for the new a three hundred and fifty at a time the new jet will be able to take on board both on the same flight
and for plane spotters who love the unique shape of the existing beluga that will remain much the same
it will be the same look says gosselin because we will operate both fleets in parallel for a number of years and it will also be compatible with existing loading means
the first of the new fleet will enter service in two thousand and twenty

in foggy conditions and on soft snow in the women's downhill at cortina d'ampezzo italy vonn recorded a time of one minute thirty nine point six one seconds beating austria's elisabeth goergl by zero point three two seconds
the victory tied vonn with austria's annemarie moser proell's who set the benchmark between one thousand nine hundred and seventy and one thousand nine hundred and eighty
i was a little bit nervous in the start the thirty year old said in an interview with the international ski federation website
i thought i skied really well on friday but it was tough conditions and i wasn't able to be on top of the podium
today was kind of the same the snow was soft but at least it was sunny
i just tried to keep my feet underneath me and not to push the skis against the snow too much and it worked out
the victory marks an incredible comeback for vonn who had been out with a serious knee injury for eighteen months
in a desperate attempt to get fit for the two thousand and fourteen sochi winter olympics vonn aggravated her knee and needed a second operation
much of the talk since her comeback has concerned the world cup record which has proved something of a distraction
every time i'm in the starting gate i'm trying to win whether it's sixty sixty one sixty two or whatever it is i just try to ski my best she said
so it was more frustrating just talking about this record in the media
but for me mentally it was the same as any other race
now i'm happy we can stop talking about it
although few will actually stop talking about it
vonn now has the chance to hold the record outright with sixty three wins in monday's super g
i've surprised myself how far i come vonn told cnn after her victory
i'm really excited for another race tomorrow
hopefully i can break the record tomorrow
i love what i do
i want to win as many races as possible
i have a lot more to give the sport
the was one last question to ask
had she spoken to her boyfriend tiger woods 
yeah i talked to him and he said he's really proud of me she confirmed
he was watching with his daughter early in the morning
i was sad he wasn't here but he's training
he's a professional athlete too
tina maze the overall leader took fifth place and increased her lead in the standings

there are many children neglected by their own parents glyzelle said sunday at a ceremony at a four hundred year old catholic university in manila
there are also many who became victims and many terrible things happened to them like drugs or prostitution
why is god allowing such things to happen even if it is not the fault of the children 
she asked the pope breaking down into tears as she spoke
another former street child jun chura told pope francis about his struggle to survive without a home
i was feeding myself with what i can find in the garbage said jun fourteen
i did not know where to go and i was sleeping on the sidewalk
when i was in the street i witness also things i don't like terrible things that happened to my companions in the street jun said
i saw that they were taught how to steal to kill also and they have no respect anymore for the adults
pope francis responded to glyzelle's question and jun's testimony by giving the two children a big hug
she is the only one who has put a question for which there is no answer and she wasn't even able to express it in words but in tears the seventy eight year old pope told the crowd
glyzelle and jun are both in the care of tulay ng kabataan foundation a non governmental organization that looks after manila's street children
the foundation came across glyzelle and her older sister a few years ago said alexandra chapeleau the group's communication manager
the girls had left home where their impoverished parents were unable to support them or get them an education and were fending for themselves on the street she said
they first attended one of the foundation's drop in centers before moving into a residential facility and starting to attend school
in november their younger brother joined them at the foundation
glyzelle is still in touch with her mother and goes home to see her at christmas chapeleau said
the foundation's center where glyzelle lives is home to about forty other former street children
most of them are victims of the terrible things that can happen in the street including physical and sexual abuse chapeleau said
but glyzelle's tears in front of the pope on sunday were apparently prompted by the intensity of the moment not because of her own experiences
she asked the question on behalf of all the children we take care of not because of something personal regarding her own story chapeleau said
the pope touched on the street children theme again later sunday when he celebrated mass in a manila park with millions of people despite the soaking rain
we need to see each child as a gift to be welcomed cherished and protected he told the enormous crowd
and we need to care for our young not allowing them to be condemned to a life on the streets
the pope had visited the center where glyzelle and others live on friday after celebrating mass at manila cathedral and reportedly said he was very moved by what he saw
there are estimated to be more than one point five million street children in the philippines about seventy thousand of them in the manila metropolitan area according to the he cares foundation another group that cares for them
in his account jun described seeing some of his friends sniffing glue and taking other drugs
he said he learned to be wary of adults offering money or help because it was often a trap to exploit the children
he initially declined an offer of support from tulay ng kabataan foundation but later found out that the organization was genuinely trying to help him
i realized that not all people have no heart he said
the pope left the philippines on monday waving as he boarded his plane at the end of an asia trip that also included time in sri lanka
in the first visit by a pope to the predominantly catholic philippines in twenty years francis paid a visit to tacloban the city ravaged by super typhoon haiyan in november two thousand and thirteen
francis had to cut short his time there at the weekend because of the approach of another typhoon
but it didn't stop him from donning a slicker to celebrate mass in tacloban on saturday for hundreds of thousands who gathered despite the stormy weather

that news came after fighting around the presidential palace and came after yemen's prime minister went into hiding when attackers shot at him
nine people were killed and sixty seven others injured iin the clashes yemen's health ministry said
the yemeni government a u.s. ally in the battle against al qaeda described the fighting as a power grab by rebels known as houthis shiite muslims who have long felt marginalized in the majority sunni country
turmoil between the two sides is worrisome to the west because a power vacuum in yemen could benefit al qaeda in the arabian peninsula a terrorist organization based in yemen that took credit for the attack on the offices of charlie hebdo in paris
it also tried to blow up a plane landing in detroit in two thousand and nine
a houthi delegate ali daghshan told cnn that the presidential committee had agreed to a deal after hours of negotiations
interior minister jalal al rowaishan also confirmed the ceasefire had been reached
there are conflicting accounts of the cause of the clashes
government officials characterize it as a power grab by the houthis
houthis say yemen's military attacked people demanding that authorities lift road closures introduced as a security measure after the presidential chief of staff was abducted in sanaa a few days ago
a western diplomat in sanaa told cnn the situation was complex
today's events appear to be the next stage in houthi plans to extend their control in yemen
but there are many players with many agendas
so this hasn't finished playing out the diplomat said
it is unclear who fired first near the presidential palace monday
control of the palace is seen as key to the control of the country
there were reports of government buildings a hospital and residential buildings being hit
the presidential palace is controlled by the government and mountaintops surrounding the palace are held by rebels known as houthis a senior interior ministry official told cnn late monday
both sides will remain where they are until a deal is signed which is expected to happen tuesday said the official
the yemeni information minister told cnn's christiane amanpour that government control is almost nonexistent
when asked to described the situation on the ground nadia al sakkaf said
this is almost a replica of what happened in september on the twenty one st of september when the houthis came into the city and took over everything and then there was the peace and partnership agreement where they pulled back a little bit and allowed a government to be created
now since then the houthis have not really left the capital
they've been around with their arms and what happened is that they've been interfering in the government's work but we were trying to get this country going the minister said
the u.n. security council will hold a special meeting to discuss yemen on tuesday
prime minister khaled bahah was fired upon when he left a meeting with president abd rabbuh mansur hadi and the houthi political group ansarallah al sakkaf said
bahah was unharmed and is now in hiding she said
he is at his place but currently he has been surrounded by houthi militias around his place and they have stationed themselves at rooftops of neighboring buildings
he is worried that the situation might escalate said the minister
the senior interior ministry official said the prime minister was inside the republican palace some seven miles from the presidential palace
the gunfire came from a houthi checkpoint near the meeting place and the attempt to kill the prime minister was a breach on an earlier ceasefire al sakkaf said
but a senior houthi official condemned the attack and denied the group had anything to do with it blaming the attempt on an unnamed third party
houthis said their convoy had also been fired upon after leaving the talks
adding to the disputes the information minister said yemeni state tv and the state run saba news agency are now under the control of the houthi political movement
but senior houthi official ali alshami denied the movement controlled either news outlet
there are concerns that as yemen spirals into greater sectarian violence al qaeda a predominantly sunni group will gain an even greater foothold there with more recruits and a base from which to attack other targets
this morning it was so chaotic
they said that nobody knew what was going on and who was in charge and these are situations where al qaeda can easily infiltrate and create al sakkaf told cnn
al qaeda in the arabian peninsula has its home in yemen where in recent months it has come under pressure from houthi rebels and government forces
but the charlie hebdo attack may show the group's apparent ability to direct operations beyond yemen's borders
it is thought likely that one or both of the brothers behind the attack in paris visited yemen and received weapons training from aqap and that one may have met with the group's former leader
a u.s. official said the united states was monitoring the violence monday and had sufficient military power nearby to evacuate its embassy on short notice if needed
al sakkaf said gunmen linked to the houthi political movement attacked the presidential palace in a bid to take control of the symbol of power
hadi the president was not in the building and is safe al sakkaf said but government officials were among an unknown number of casualties
houthi rebels claimed responsibility saturday for the abduction of presidential chief of staff ahmed bin mubarak
al sakkaf said monday's dispute began when the government tried to implement a security plan as it feared more abductions of key staff
but a top houthi official said houthis tried to mediate with the army and asked for roads to be opened for citizens which led to their people getting attacked
he said they then had to defend themselves
hadi appointed bin mubarak as premier in october but the rebels rejected the nomination
osama sari senior media adviser to the houthi movement in yemen said the houthis had detained bin mubarak as a message to the president
it was because the president wanted to introduce a new constitution without the approval of the houthis sari said
the abduction came amid increased tensions in the arabian peninsula country after the rise of shiite houthi rebels
houthis swept into the capital last year sparking battles that left more than three hundred dead in a month
in september houthis signed a ceasefire deal with the government
since then its members have installed themselves in key positions in the government and financial institutions
hadi was elected president in february two thousand and twelve
he was the only candidate on the ballot

a day earlier the pope cut short his trip to tacloban as an approaching typhoon with blistering winds threatened the philippine city about six hundred kilometers southeast of manila
tacloban is still recovering from the two thousand and thirteen disaster of super typhoon haiyan described as one of the strongest storms ever recorded with one hundred and ninety five mph sustained winds

he plans to leave manila for rome on monday

these are all the hot topics around the inside politics table this week
president obama says he's on the offensive and he has certainly unveiled an ambitious list of proposals in the weeks leading up to the state of the union speech tuesday night
but julie pace of the associated press notes that his schedule contradicts his rhetoric as he crosses into one of the indisputable stages of a lame duck presidency
nonessential foreign travel
he's going to india basically for a parade and a visit to the taj mahal said pace
think about the timing of this
the president is going to india three days after his state of the union address
a period of time when he normally would be out trying to rally congress and the public behind his agenda
i think this says all you need to know about the likelihood that anything he announces on tuesday actually gets done
what will obama say about race and policing in the sotu 
nia malika henderson of the washington post points out the issue has receded from the national conversation even as attorney general eric holder has been taking the white house's message on increasing trust between law enforcement and communities around the country
and members of the congressional black caucus while celebrating martin luther king jr.'s legacy in ferguson this weekend are also pressing the president to include funding for body cameras in his annual budget
a lot of people waiting to see what the president will say if anything about race and policing on tuesday henderson said
on friday former massachusetts gov
mitt romney said he's seriously considering a two thousand and sixteen presidential run but didn't reveal any more details about his plans
but the washington post's robert costa says romney watchers might be getting additional information on monday when he is scheduled to give a paid speech with a qanda scheduled to a corporate audience
this is his first public appearance since he spoke at the republican national committee on friday said costa
and we're really going to have to see how much farther is romney going to move 
is he going to send some more signals about his message and his pitch should he run for president

chris christie might be telling republicans to relax about the race for the white house but sen. lindsey graham wants the gop to get serious about his candidacy
cnn's peter hamby reports that graham had a meeting with some of his top donors about a week ago in south carolina and told them
in the first quarter of this year i'm going to raise half a million dollars go to early states and see if there's a space for me in this field
while graham's candidacy might end up being more of an issue driven campaign rather than a serious bid for the nation's top office his run might cause some trouble for other candidates in an important early contest
if he does run remember south carolina is an early primary state and that would put a lot of his top donors and operatives in a pickle because usually they have their choice of candidates to support said hamby
but if their hometown guy runs for president they're going to have a choice to make
it has been more than a month now since hillary clinton held a public event but that doesn't mean she is taking a break from politics
to the contrary
as has been widely reported the former secretary of state is building a two thousand and sixteen campaign team that looks very different from her two thousand and eight high command
her husband's former chief of staff john podesta is leaving the obama white house to lead team hillary
and two veterans of the two thousand and eight and two thousand and twelve obama campaigns will serve as clinton's top strategist and chief media adviser
the biggest question is whether clinton has been using this down time to hone her campaign rationale to answer liberal critics who say she is too cozy with wall street or republican critics who label her more about the past than the future
but while awaiting her return to the public stage on wednesday even senior republicans and those democrats pushing to draft elizabeth warren concede her two thousand and sixteen staff recruits are top notch

the recent spate of terror attacks and threats in europe has many wondering what the next target might be and how the danger can be mitigated
here are the latest developments
five belgian nationals have been charged with participation in a terrorist organization after police raided a suspect terror cell in verviers the country's federal prosecutor said
three are in custody and two have been released under strict conditions erik van der sypt said
and two additional suspects are in french custody after they were detained while trying to cross from france into italy through the frejus tunnel the prosecutor said
the suspected terror cell in verviers which included people returning from syria planned to target police officers van der sypt said
police said they recovered weapons bomb making materials and police uniforms
two suspects were killed in the police raid thursday and a third was injured and taken into custody
authorities have not released their identities
heavily armed guards filtered through the streets of brussels and antwerp on saturday a sight the country hasn't seen in thirty five years
why is belgium particularly vulnerable 
the small country is believed to have more suspected jihadists per capita than any other country in western europe
greek authorities say they are cooperating with belgian authorities on an investigation and on sunday belgium requested the extradition of one of the suspects arrested in greece
greek police confirmed that there have been some arrests and are looking for other individuals but said that none so far were linked to the belgian plot
belgian federal prosecutor van der sypt however said the belgian investigation gave us enough reason to ask for the extradition of one of the persons that were arrested yesterday by the greek authorities
the investigation revealed that one of the people arrested in greece could be involved in the plot that was stopped in belgium van der sypt said
european counterterrorism agencies are scrambling to assess the potential terrorism threat from people with suspected links to islamic extremists
as many as twenty sleeper cells of between one hundred and twenty and one hundred and eighty people could be ready to strike in france germany belgium and the netherlands a western intelligence source told cnn
european union and middle east intelligence agencies identified an imminent threat to belgium and possibly to the netherlands the source told cnn
there is a tremendous amount of concern over sleeper cells in europe said a western official with direct knowledge of the situation
but while there is a realistic threat to the netherlands government spokesman edmond messchaert said there is no concrete or specific information of an attack in the netherlands
two additional people whose dna was found on the belongings of jihadist amedy coulibaly are being sought by authorities according to a source in paris with knowledge of the investigation into this month's attacks in the french capital
the dna of one was found on a charger belonging to coulibaly the source told cnn
coulibaly is accused of killing four people in a siege at a kosher market and gunning down a police officer
meanwhile three women detained in connection with the paris terror attacks were released from custody sunday the public prosecutor's office told cnn
nine other people will remain in custody for at least forty eight hours while the investigation continues
the detainees were held after a series of terror attacks this month that left seventeen people dead including twelve people in an attack at the offices of the charlie hebdo satirical newspaper
al qaeda in the arabian peninsula al qaeda's yemen affiliate claimed responsibility for the charlie hebdo shooting
the publisher of charlie hebdo says the newspaper will increase the press run of the latest issue which features a depiction of the prophet mohammed to seven million
isis the extremist islamist group that controls swaths of iraq and syria runs large training facilities in syria and has access to thousands of potential european recruits
officials are monitoring groups of men who have returned to europe from fighting in syria
it is believed isis directed operatives to return to europe to launch attacks in retaliation for airstrikes against the terror group in syria and iraq according to the official
several european nations including the united kingdom france belgium and the netherlands are participating in the air campaign against isis in iraq


the attacks happened in the villages of mabass and makxy in the mayo tsanaga division of the far north region of cameroon on sunday morning saiid abdulkarim a journalist for the state broadcaster told cnn
three of those kidnapped were found dead abdulkarim said
the cameroonian government did not immediately comment
meanwhile thousands of chadian troops arrived in cameroon to join that country's soldiers in the fight against boko haram
the governor of cameroon's far north region mijiyawa bakary told cnn that the first contingent of chadian troops arrived in a convoy of more than four hundred vehicles and a second wave of soldiers were expected to arrive soon
the chadian soldiers are coming in with dozens of tanks armored vehicles and other military equipment cameroon defense ministry spokesman col. didier badjeck said
the chadian parliament unanimously voted friday to send troops to cameroon and nigeria to join in the fight against boko haram
the move comes after cameroon's president paul biya made a strong call for international cooperation in the fight against boko haram
biya told diplomats recently that boko haram was a global threat that calls for a global response
such should be the response of the international community including the african union and our regional organizations he said
chadian officials concluded that boko haram also poses a danger to chad
chadian president idriss deby said attacks on cameroon by the terrorist group could destroy chad's economy
we can't remain indifferent to what is happening to our neighbors deby said
cameroon is the entry and exit point for chad economically
much of what is imported to chad comes through the cameroonian seaport of douala and chad's crude oil is transported through a pipeline that runs from southern chad to a floating facility eleven kilometers off the cameroon coast
the presence of chadian troops on the front could be key to reversing the gains so far made by the terrorist group
trained in desert combat chadian forces played a critical role in fighting jihadists in northern mali where they became major allies to french troops in the fight against terrorists there
in fact they were instrumental in the killing of some high profile jihadists
the involvement of chadian troops marks a major shift in cameroon chad anti terrorism cooperation
in the past year it focused mostly on securing individual borders
while chad is the first country to put boots on the ground in cameroon the international community and regional bodies are also expressing concern
on friday the russian ambassador to cameroon nicolay ratsiborinski said his country will supply cameroon with modern and sophisticated military weapons
he said the equipment will include heavy artillery armored cars and missiles
michael stephen hoza u.s. ambassador to cameroon also said his country would help train cameroon soldiers and offer equipment for the fight
boko haram has been staging cross border raids on cameroon the latest being the attempt by the insurgents to take over a cameroon military base in kolofata
cameroonian troops killed one hundred and forty three of them and lost one soldier
on january three boko haram fighters briefly took over control of a military base in achigashia forcing cameroonian soldiers to retreat and then for the first time use airstrikes against the insurgents
attacks on military installations mark a big shift in boko haram operations in cameroon
initiallythey would cross the border and either attack to steal food or kidnap nationals and expatriates in exchange for ransoms
cameroon has already deployed about seven thousand troops across the far north where boko haram has scaled up attacks over the past six months

an american in abu dhabi he found himself frightened even though the other prisoners were sleeping
movie scenes from midnight express and brubaker swirled through his head
he sat at a table in the common area waiting for the others to wake not knowing what the reaction would be to his presence
black who has a degree in architecture three master's degrees and a doctorate in educational psychology was in abu dhabi the capital of united arab emirates for october's creative thinkers conference
he was to present a workshop and emcee the event
on a tuesday morning the seventy year old got up early to take a walk in the neighborhoods near his hotel
an avid photographer black took his camera to snap photos of houses and a couple of the mosques he passed
when he left the second mosque he was approached by a man in uniform
he motioned black to get into a camouflaged truck
i had no idea what he wanted black said but never felt threatened so i got in
he was driven a short distance to a building with a sign out front that read reception
he waited about an hour before he was guided back outside and told do not photograph security areas
black asked for clarification but he was waved away with no further explanation he said
he decided to continue his walk
a few blocks away he came upon a sign on a lamppost that said in english photography forbidden
thinking a photo of the sign would make for a novel facebook post he snapped an image
after crossing the road he was approached by two other uniformed men in a second camouflaged truck and waved into the backseat
he was driven back to reception which black believes was a police station where his passport camera and cell phone were seized
black tried to keep his composure
he was questioned and moved to different rooms waiting for hours at a time but the process was civil he said
no one harmed him in any way
after eight or nine hours at the police station a man came in and asked him to stand
his hands and feet were shackled and a hood was put over his head
he was escorted to an suv where his wrists were chained to the floor
after hours more of interrogation he was driven to the khalifa jail
when the sun rose that morning black was relieved to be greeted with smiles from the other inmates
a few prisoners from the philippines spoke english
their conversation revolved around why black was there and the daily routine at the jail
later in the day police took him back to his hotel and allowed him to retrieve his belongings and check out of the hotel
concerned friends and family called the hotel but couldn't obtain any information on his whereabouts
after black spent about a week in jail a translator for the prosecutor's office felt bad about his plight and googled his name black later learned
the translator contacted some of his associates which is how friends and family members learned what had happened to him
he was quickly transferred to al wathba prison where he met a syrian in his mid thirty s named kousai
all of those who could speak any english were very supportive and helpful in both the prison and the jail black recalled but kousai made the most concerted effort
well educated he had a master's degree in business administration from florida state university and spoke fluent english
black called him the cell blocks's den mother
he was always trying to help and facilitate the needs of the prisoners who came from countries such as oman yemen nigeria and egypt all of them foreign workers
kousai himself had been in prison for six months on an immigration violation
when black first walked in kousai and his roommate a massive man everyone called the foreman offered him an orange drink and crackers
the foreman didn't speak much english black said but seemed to be in charge of the cell block
kousai helped black settle into the facility making sure he had snacks and arranging for black to have his prison clothes laundered
in one act of kindness kousai was chatting with his wife on the prison phone and asked black if there was anyone he wanted to contact
kousai's wife called black's daughter on her cell phone and connected the two on the same phone line
it was the first time that black had been able to talk to someone outside of the prison or jail
his family finally knew first hand where he was and what had happened to him
as the weeks dragged on black became immersed in prison life
he walked the cell block halls to pass time often recalling humorous episodes of m a s h and frasier to buoy his spirits
he and the other prisoners told jokes or talked about funny movies to help inject humor in their otherwise serious world
when he got down about his situation many of the prisoners would ask him to join their conversations share cookies and boxed drinks they had bought from the canteen or offer food they had cooked in their cells
if the prisoner didn't speak english a simple smile or thumbs up was offered
black was grateful for the acts of friendship and he made an effort to reciprocate he said
meanwhile black's family friends and colleagues were raising money to hire an abu dhabi attorney and working official channels to get black released
they called themselves fab friends of alan black
the u.s. embassy sent representatives to meet with black several times while he was at al wathba
many of the prisoners and guards told him he would be out soon but the days dragged on
he continued to endure the daily routines of incarceration while waiting for his case to go before a judge
black was the only westerner in his cell block though he believes he saw a few others in the prison he said
besides a nigerian man he was the only christian
the rest if they had religious beliefs were muslim
five times a day the devout would roll out their prayer mats
black never spoke much about religion with the other inmates he said and he never felt any animosity aimed toward him for being a christian
he had no biases against muslims and they had no predispositions about him
in fact many of the inmates told black they prayed he would be released soon he said
on november seventeen almost a month after his arrest a lawyer pleaded black's case before the superior court's three judge panel
he was very passionate and forceful black said
he told the judges that he thought the case was an embarrassment and that i should have been fined and released the first day
the judges agreed and ruled black not guilty no intent to do harm
he was fined five hundred dirham around one hundred and thirty five dollar dollars the minimum fine allowed by the court system
it was later waived because of time served
it took about twenty eight hours to get fully processed and black immediately made his way to the airport and flew back home to athens georgia
black was grateful about how quickly his case was ultimately resolved he said
some of the prisoners he met had been in prison for years and many still hadn't seen their case presented in court
the support of his family and friends was important black said but he considered prisoners such as kousai his angels
it was their generosity of spirit humor and kindness that made a bad situation tolerable
the episode reinforced black's belief that while differences exist among cultures in the end we are all human beings
sometimes it takes something like this to show you people will reach out when you need it he said
it's important to be open to your emotions and know people care
black plans to keep in touch with some of the men he met in prison he said and has already skyped with kousai who was recently released and is back in damascus

the picture appeared on matalon's instagram feed on january eleven
it shows matalon smiling with greige miss slovenia and miss japan in miami where the miss universe pageant will take place on sunday
good morning from us
reads the caption
the image ignited a wide ranging debate in the comments of the picture about the ongoing conflict between israel and much of the arab world
officially israel and lebanon are still at war even though there have been no large scale hostilities on the border since two thousand and six
travel between them by citizens of the two countries is prohibited
the miss universe organization defended the picture saying it was unfortunate that the picture has been perceived in a negative light
at an event with one of our charitable partners miss universe lebanon and miss universe israel innocently ended up in an impromptu photo together which was then posted on instagram the organization said in a statement to cnn
it is unfortunate to know a photo of four smiling women from different parts of the world working together at an event could be misconstrued as anything other than what it is a celebration of universal friendship which the miss universe pageant is all about
greige addressed the controversy on saturday on social media sharing what she called the truth behind the photo
she also posted the same photo on her instagram account with miss israel cropped out
from the start of pageant preparations greige said she was very cautious to avoid being in any photo or communication with miss israel
as she explains it she was posing for a photo with miss japan and miss slovenia when suddenly miss israel jumped in took a selfie and put it on her social media she said
matalon weighed in sunday after a website posted an article with the headline miss lebanon in trouble
she took a screenshot of the article and captioned it it doesn't surprise me but it still makes me sad and posted it on her social media accounts
too bad you can not put the hostility out of the game only for three weeks of an experience of a lifetime that we can meet girls from around the world and also from the neighboring country
comments on her original photo echoed the sentiment
as a lebanese i really don't see anything wrong with this picture
it's time we promote peace over violence as the latter has gotten us no where
and if you really wan na discuss politics it surely shouldn't be under the picture of four beautiful ladies who have nothing to do with your b t. good luck ladies
it's not the first time beauty pageants have been caught up in political controversy
according to multiple news reports former miss lebanon christina sawaya pulled out of miss universe two thousand and two because she did not want to share the stage with miss israel amid tensions in the middle east
the miss universe pageant has always been a celebration of different cultures welcoming women from all around the globe
it provides an opportunity for the participants to see just how much they have in common the organization said
with eighty eight women from around the world coming together for the miss universe pageant new friendships are forged and we hope that these relationships can make inroads for change in the future

but that's not the way cubans see things
they regard many facets of daily life as falling into a gray area open to their own selective interpretation at least until the authorities catch up with them
that was the case when i decided to join ninety three year old tono torrente on a trip to the outskirts of havana to a cockfighting arena
on paper this was a privately operated underground venue unsanctioned and unregulated by the cuban state
for a semi clandestine event it was clear plenty of people seemed to know about it
as i picked my way down a short dirt track and past a couple of tethered oxen i heard voices shouting and what sounded like scores of roosters crowing
in front of a metal gate two men barred my way
there's a problem they said
i assumed they were referring to the camera gear in my hands or the fact i was a foreigner
entrance fee will cost you seventy five pesos they said
that's the equivalent of about three u.s. dollars more than half a week's salary for a cuban state worker
but for me it was the price of passage into the twilight world of many ordinary cubans where rules are never quite what they seem
on the other side of the gate one of the first people i ran into was the event organizer
not allowed but not really forbidden
well this definitely isn't permitted but i don't really think it's forbidden he said laughing and explaining he'd been staging cockfights every saturday for the last fourteen years
many fans of the bloodsport had told me stories of how they had been at fights that had been raided by the police and were forced to run away to avoid arrest
when i asked this organizer how he had managed to sidestep sanctions for so long he winked and placed two fingers on his shoulder a hint he was bribing a contact in the security services to turn a blind eye
talking about official corruption however is highly frowned upon as well as bad for his business so i made my way ringside without further questions
the cockpit and small terraced stands were made of welded scraps of rusty metal
not elegant but highly effective
about two hundred men and a handful of women and children were clinging to the bars cheering on their favored rooster as it flapped and scrapped in a sawdust circle
my guide for the day tono torrente who lives miles away in ornate old havana quickly filled me in on tactics
it's part technique and part luck he said
in fact it's mostly luck
it's a bit like life itself
if you were born to win then you'll win
but if you were born to lose it doesn't matter how good you are you'll end up like this he said flapping his arm and simulating the death of a rooster
i'd met torrente a few days earlier as i searched for a barber's shop
the salon was closed but torrente sat nearby clipping the belly feathers off one of the four fighting cocks he is currently rearing
his birds are still too young and too underweight
he's feeding them corn and putting them on a strict training routine
but on the saturday afternoon i joined him he had no direct stake in the fights
cockfighting itself may be somewhat a gray area the letter of the law appears to permit a handful state run events at venues where health and safety measures are enforced but bans private events like the one i was at
but cuban law seems unequivocal in declaring gambling illegal
prior to fidel castro's one thousand nine hundred and fifty nine revolution the u.s. mafia controlled casinos and prostitution in cuba
thanks to the income from those rackets the capos also had a say in how government was run
the revolution's law book somehow seemed to have been misplaced here on the outskirts of havana
gamblers shouted across the arena and flicked hand signs at one another offering odds to any takers
when one rooster collapsed in a bloodied heap and the other was hoisted victorious small wads of banknotes changed hands
on the sidelines of the cockfight a man running a dice game on a green baize table invited me take to a photo
he quickly rescinded the offer when i reminded him dice games and gambling were illegal
you can't get rid of cockfighting it's part of cuban culture
it's the sport of the common people one prize cock owner who gave him name as noel told me
beyond the question of legality it's clear cockfighting is a passion for some in cuba like in other parts of latin america
torrente told me he grew up in western cuba alongside a cockpit
ever since i was born there was a cockfighting arena near my house
the peasants would come on their horse to the fights
i used to love that he said
torrente's father died when he was just a boy
his uncle antonio paid for his upbringing
his uncle left cuba in the early one thousand nine hundred and twenty s for new york and worked as a traveling pharmaceutical salesman
uncle antonio used to send a check back to torrente's mother every month
and when torrente was twelve in the early one thousand nine hundred and thirty s his uncle sent for him and put him into school in new york
by his own admission torrente learned nothing and was an appalling student
he remembers swimming in the hudson river when he should have been in class
his uncle sent him back to havana after a year
they told my uncle not to waste any more of his money on my education
it wasn't worth it torrente explained
by the time the cuban revolution came torrente says his uncle had purchased six or seven buildings in havana as an investment
he had also gifted a barber's shop to torrente who took up the trade
but castro and his rebels stripped wealthy absentee landowners like torrente's uncle antonio of his property and redistributed some of it among society's poorest
torrente was left with a single apartment where he's lived for the last sixty years
three of his own children decided to leave cuba and head to the united states
but torrente says he refused to go for a very simple reason
cockfighting was illegal in the united states
i didn't want to go he said
when it boils down to it i think life revolves around just three things
women cockfighting and boxing he said
in cuba he had all three
torrente is clearly no fan of cuba's socialist system
it seemed that when the revolution took place everything was going to change and get better
but for me and many others it didn't
they took away my barber's shop
they took my uncle's buildings
now i get just nine dollar pension a month he said
then he gently placed his index finger on the tip of his tongue
but you can't speak too much about that he said reflecting the reticence of an older generations of cubans not to openly voice criticism of the government to strangers
with u.s. president barack obama's december announcement to work towards normalization of ties with an old cold war foe torrente is hopeful
he says he doubts he will live to see the cuban government returning the property it expropriated from his uncle
but the easing of trade and travel restrictions will make it easier for his three children and grandchildren to come back and forth to visit from florida
the changes will also allow his relatives if they can afford it to send higher value remittances to fund him in his retirement
funding his retirement of course means funding his undying passion for fighting cocks
on sunny days torrente places his four raucous roosters in separate small cages outside on the sidewalk
and while he is surely hoping for a thaw in u.s. cuba relations he's reserving his biggest hope for a young rooster he calls painted indian
torrente sets him on a rusty kitchen scale holds up three fingers and says
he weighs three pounds
maybe in six months he'll be ready
i think he's going to be a great fighter

gen. mohammed ali allahdadi was killed in the same sunday airstrike that killed six others during a field inspection in quneitra a hezbollah statement said
the israel defense forces declined to comment on the strike
the son of a late hezbollah commander was also killed in the airstrike hezbollah said
jihad mughniyeh the son of imad mughniyeh was born in one thousand nine hundred and eighty nine
his father was assassinated in syria in two thousand and eight
according to a statement from the lebanon based militant group a group was doing a field inspection in quneitra when a helicopter opened fire

most of those released saturday were children and the elderly said saman jabari the kurdistan democratic party leader
once they were freed they walked up to a peshmerga checkpoint southwest of the city of kirkuk according to jabari
they are now under the care of kurdish authorities
yazidis are among iraq's smallest minorities
they are of kurdish descent and their religion is considered a pre islamic sect that draws from christianity judaism and zoroastrianism
one of the oldest religious communities in the world they have long suffered persecution with many muslims referring to them as devil worshippers
the militant group isis which calls itself the islamic state steamrolled into iraq's north last year forcing hundreds of thousands of minorities from their homes
the u.s. state department estimates that five hundred thousand yazidis live in northern iraq accounting for less than one percents of the country's population

that means average land and sea temperatures worldwide have never been hotter in modern times according to the national oceanic and atmospheric administration and the national aeronautics and space administration
this isn't about whether we believe in science
it's about whether we believe the thermometer
in fact the sixteen hottest years on record have all occurred since one thousand nine hundred and ninety seven the new data confirm contributing to widening deserts rising seas withering drought ravaging storms blistering heat and other climate change impacts reaching from the tiniest african village to our own backyards
here in the united states arizona nevada alaska and california all wrapped up their hottest years on record
california remains mired in the grip of a three year drought its worst in centuries
the northeast is still rebuilding from hurricane sandy
and that was just one of the climate related disasters that cost this country an estimated one hundred and thirty nine billion dollar in damages in two thousand and twelve alone
above and beyond the economic costs climate change has created a widening humanitarian crisis noted by spiritual leaders around the world
for example pope francis is expected to publish an encyclical on the state of the world's environment singling out climate change as an urgent challenge to global stewardship
it's reported that he'll call on people of all faiths to embrace our obligation to protect future generations from this grave and gathering scourge
president obama has embarked on the single greatest u.s. effort yet to combat this growing menace by reducing the dangerous carbon pollution that's driving climate chaos
he has directed the environmental protection agency to put in place the first limits on carbon pollution from the power plants that account for about forty percents of the u.s. carbon footprint
under the president's clean power plan we'll cut carbon emissions from our power plants twenty six percents by two thousand and twenty and thirty percents by two thousand and thirty
we can do better than that and we should
the president's plan puts us on the right track
since last summer epa officials have been hard at work coordinating with their state counterparts public service commissions power companies and other vested stakeholders to come up with tailor made plans to hit the targets in the most cost effective way
some power companies are already well on their way investing in efficiency so we can do more with less waste getting more power from the wind and sun cleaning up dirty power plants or some combination of the three
even as we as a nation begin to make progress though some coal gas and oil companies and their allies on capitol hill want to turn us back around
republican leaders in the congress have pledged to lead legislative efforts meant to keep the epa from cutting carbon pollution
the republican leaders aren't offering answers of their own mind you
they just want to block any action that could help us address the problem of climate change
it's part of the big polluter agenda they've vowed to press putting fossil fuel profits first and putting the rest of us at risk
we have a responsibility in this country to stand up and speak out for what matters most
that's the essence of american democracy
it's part of what makes us exceptional
it's part of what makes us great
we just finished worldwide the hottest year on record
those are facts no amount of climate change denial can alter
we have a choice in this country
we can continue to feed climate disaster by anchoring our future in the fossil fuels of the past or we can protect future generations from the ravages of climate change by investing in the clean energy solutions of tomorrow

conflicting accounts from the southeast african nation put the number killed at anywhere from dozens to more than one hundred and seventy
gift of the givers an african nongovernmental organization specializing in disaster response said malawi was facing probably the greatest flood disaster in the history of its existence
in a facebook post saturday the organization said one hundred and seventy three people were confirmed killed and warned of worse news to come
the death toll is expected to rise as it is believed that one hundred and eighty three people have been swept away from one village alone the group said
massive destruction to agriculture roads bridges and general infrastructure including power facilities has complicated the situation due to prolonged power outages
malawi president peter mutharika on wednesday put the number of dead at forty eight
declaring a state of emergency in the areas affected he said an estimated seventy thousand people had been forced from their homes
he appealed for international assistance saying
tents and food are urgently required
rescue operations are also a priority
gift of the givers said that two hundred thousand people had been displaced and eleven thousand homes damaged
a day earlier the u.n. humanitarian affairs agency ocha put the number displaced at about one hundred thousand
medecins san frontiers also known as doctors without borders said friday that around twenty thousand people in the country's southern tip remain cut off from the rest of the country without food health care and ways to prevent possible outbreaks
the current flooding is due to weeks of heavy rain exacerbated by tropical cyclone bansi gift of the givers said
however another storm due to arrive sunday tropical cyclone chedza could present even more of a threat
chedza is expected to be far more destructive than cyclone bansi bringing more heavy rains and greater flooding gift of the givers said
flood rescue and medical teams have been put on standby in case of the worst it said
the organization said malawi's military had already rescued more than four thousand people with the fear that many more are trapped in inaccessible areas
floodwaters up to six feet deep have submerged homes and bridges making access to some areas possible only by helicopter msf said
humanitarian relief is slowly arriving in the district of chikwawa where the waters have started to recede msf said
but other communities downstream in the nsanje district are still in trouble
the floods are behaving like a slow tsunami with the river swelling progressively downstream towards the south and mozambique says amaury gregoire msf's head of mission in malawi
most of nsanje and east bank are submerged under two to three meters of water which has transformed these vast plains into a giant lake engulfing houses and bridges
even though these areas are prone to floods old people i talked to could not remember events of this magnitude
the floods have destroyed crops that many people rely on and swept away their meager possessions raising fears for the future once the waters recede
there's also the risk of outbreaks of disease msf said as those who have fled the floods seek refuge with friends or relatives as well as in camps
msf has been distributing mosquito nets and water treatment kits and building latrines to try to limit the spread of disease
the little mud houses are very crowded and with most wells and boreholes contaminated by the floods people are living in precarious unsanitary conditions said gregoire
gift of the givers warned of the danger of a cholera outbreak as well as other waterborne diseases thanks to the lack of clean drinking water and contamination with sewerage
the u.n. world food programme said friday it was preparing to move stocks of food to the affected areas
this will include more than one hundred metric tons of high energy biscuits enough to meet the immediate food needs of some seventy seven thousand people said elisabeth byrs of the wfp
malawi with a population of thirteen million is one of the poorest countries in the world
more than forty percents of children have low growth for their age as a result of under nutrition byrs said

three passengers all chinese citizens have been rescued and the search operation continues an official from the search and rescue office of the jiangsu maritime administration told cnn
those rescued included an interpreter and the suppliers of some of the equipment on board
the boat which had twenty five people aboard was testing water in the hubei channel china's xinhua state news agency said
among the twenty five on board were eight foreign nationals the china news service reported
rescuers said their efforts were hampered by strong currents and cold water xinhua said
as many as twenty three vessels were involved in search and rescue operations including a crane that is being used to lift the boat which turned over as it sank out of the water
rescuers believe that there are several people trapped in the boat's cabin
one of the rescued passengers identified as translator wang chenkai told xinhua that he tried to hold onto one of the japanese engineers but the current broke his grip
only the two of us were in the cockpit he said
we have just finished the host load test of the main engine of the boat when the vessel suddenly slid over
water immediately filled in
xinhua reported that the owner of the boat had not followed procedure for the water testing operation and had not filed a route

ahmed bin mubarak top aide to president abd rabbuh mansur hadi was abducted by gunmen saturday morning security officials said
houthi rebels were forced to seize mubarak and this was an important step to cut the way of any coup attempt on the peace and transition deal said a statement by the rebels political faction ansarullah
hadi appointed bin mubarak premier back in october but the rebels rejected the nomination
a senior media adviser to the houthi movement in yemen osama sari told cnn that the presidential chief of staff had been detained by the houthis as a message to the president
sari added this was because the president wanted to introduce a new constitution without the approval of the houthis
a yemeni official close to the presidential administration also told cnn that the presidential chief of staff had been detained by armed men linked to the houthi tribe
the official said they believed the detention was linked to disagreement over the constitution
this is force for political gain a ridiculous show of muscle flexing the official said
the abduction comes amid rising tensions in the arabian peninsula country following the rise of shiite houthi rebels
houthis swept into the capital last year sparking battles that left more than three hundred dead in a month
in september houthis signed a ceasefire deal with the government
since then its members have installed themselves in key positions in the government and financial institutions
adding to yemen's turmoil is al qaeda in the arabian peninsula a terror group that has been exploiting and stoking the instability
on saturday the houthi media outlet al maseerah repeated the group's claim of responsibility
the rebels further elaborated on their motives for the abduction in their statement
surely there are series of steps the resistance forces will conduct to stop those powers from negligence and to stop their criminal activities against the people today and in the future the rebels statement said posted on facebook
president hadi must understand the sensitivity of the current situation and not be an umbrella for corrupt and criminal powers the statement added
the uk ambassador to yemen and the u.s. embassy in sanaa called for bin mubarak's immediate release
very concerned about the kidnapping of dr ahmed bin mubarak
few have done more to support the two thousand and eleven revolution and ideals jane marriott the british ambassador to yemen said on twitter
the revolution refers to months of demonstrations and crackdowns that led to civilian deaths in two thousand and eleven
toward the end of that year then president ali abdullah saleh resigned and powers were transferred to then vice president hadi
hadi was elected president in february two thousand and twelve
he was the only candidate on the ballot

the eleven year old mystery of what happened to the uk sponsored beagle two mars lander on its trip to the red planet's surface appeared to be mostly solved friday with the announcement the craft had been spotted in high resolution nasa images taken from orbit
the lander crammed with devices to look for signs of life on mars never radioed home after hitching a ride aboard the european space agency's mars express orbiter and dropping into the atmosphere on december twenty five two thousand and three
the images appear to show that the lander's solar panels didn't fully open after landing preventing the craft from getting power and exposing the antenna it would have used to communicate with controllers on earth according to the space agency
while the reasons for that failure remain unknown the discovery of the lander helps solve one of the most enduring mysteries in martian exploration said mark sims a beagle two team member from the university of leicester
every christmas day since two thousand and three i have wondered what happened to beagle two he said adding that he'd almost given up hope of ever knowing what had come of the lander
the highly complex entry descent and landing sequence seems to have worked perfectly and only during the final phases of deployment did beagle two unfortunately run into problems he said
the lander which is less than two meters across when fully deployed was first spotted in the nasa images by michael croon of trier germany a former member of the european space agency's mars express operations team the uk space agency said
croon is among a group of beagle two team members who have spent years combing through images from nasa's hirise camera which is on the agency's mars reconnaissance orbiter looking for signs of the missing craft the agency said
he found it in an area near the planned landing zone an impact basin called isidis planitia close to the martian equator
the grainy images appear to show the lander resting on the surface its solar panels only partially deployed
the craft's rear cover and parachutes are nearby
had the lander deployed properly a suite of onboard tools would have been used to analyze rocks soil and atmosphere for signs of life
the lander the first european craft sent to the martian surface was named after the hms beagle the ship that carried charles darwin on a groundbreaking five year scientific survey
while its namesake resulted in no such breakthroughs david parker chief executive of the uk space agency said the discovery proves the beagle two had its successes
the history of space exploration is marked by both success and failure he said
this finding makes the case that beagle two was more of a success than we previously knew and undoubtedly an important step in europe's continuing exploration of mars

in a statement friday the court's top prosecutor said the decision follows the palestinians signing of the rome statute
in doing so they officially become icc members on april one giving the court jurisdiction over alleged crimes in palestinian territories
while a preliminary examination is not a formal investigation it allows the court to review evidence and determine whether to investigate suspects on both sides
there are no timelines provided in the rome statute for a decision on a preliminary examination the icc said in a statement
israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu described the inquiry as an outrage saying the court is overstepping its boundaries
the palestinian authority is not a country and therefore it is not the court's place also according to its own rules to carry out an examination like this netanyahu told the jerusalem post
the united states also said it strongly disagreed with the court's decision
as we have said repeatedly we do not believe that palestine is a state and therefore we do not believe that it is eligible to join the icc the state department said in a statement
it urged the warring sides to resolve their differences through direct negotiations
we will continue to oppose actions against israel at the icc as counterproductive to the cause of peace it said
but the icc begs to differ with the definition of a state for its purposes and refers to the territories as palestine
the office considers that since palestine was granted observer state status in the un by the unga it must be considered a state for the purposes of accession to the rome statute it said in a statement
prosecutor fatou bensouda said her office will conduct its analysis in full independence and impartiality
the latest war between israel and hamas militants in gaza left more than two thousand people dead last summer
the inquiry will include alleged war crimes committed since june
the international criminal court was set up in two thousand and two to prosecute genocide crimes against humanity and war crimes
as members of the court palestinians may be subjected to counter charges as well

raif badawi convicted on charges that included insulting islam had been scheduled to receive the second of twenty sentenced floggings after friday prayers in jeddah
he received the first flogging on january nine
a doctor who examined him before the scheduled flogging determined that his wounds had not yet healed and that the flogging should be delayed human rights group amnesty international said
the doctor concluded that the wounds had not yet healed properly and that he would not be able to withstand another round of lashes at this time amnesty international said in a statement
badawi's wife ensaf haida said from her home in canada that she expects the floggings to resume next friday
one of his friends ali rizvi said from toronto that the delay is definitely encouraging
none of us are completely satisfied he told cnn's new day
this is the saudi regime he said
we don't know what's going to happen from here onwards but it's definitely a step in the right direction
rights groups and others including the u.s. state department have called for saudi arabia to call off the floggings the first of which appeared to be captured on unverified cell phone video uploaded to youtube
not only does this postponement on health grounds expose the utter brutality of this punishment it underlines its outrageous inhumanity said said boumedouha amnesty international's deputy middle east and north africa program director
badawi was convicted in two thousand and fourteen and sentenced to ten years in prison and one thousand lashes after creating an online forum in two thousand and eight that his wife says was meant to encourage discussion about faith


when more than two hundred girls were in april two thousand and fourteen kidnapped by boko haram terrorists from their school in chibok the international community rallied around nigeria
from michelle obama to alicia keys to malala yousafzai personalities from across the globe lent their voices to the bringbackourgirls social media campaign
this response contrasted greatly to the relative apathy which followed what has been described by amnesty international as boko haram's deadliest attack the massacre of up to two thousand mostly women and children in baga town of northeast nigeria last week
at about the same time that the baga bloodbath was making headlines around the world the international community was rallying around france in support against the terrorist attacks on the charlie hebdo newspaper offices in paris giving rise to the jesuischarlie social media campaign
a simultaneous iambaga social media campaign has failed to gain much steam
the igbo proverb points out that a man can not expect you to both marry a wife for him and then buy the new couple a bed on which to sleep
similarly a country is expected to take responsibility and set sail with the winds of global support
france's president francois hollande was addressing the world's media and showing leadership within minutes of the attack
his government's efforts to hunt down the terrorists were broadcast for all the world to see
nigeria's president jonathan on the other hand waited two weeks before even offering a word on the chibok kidnappings
so far he has said nothing about baga
however president jonathan has issued a statement condemning the paris attacks
perhaps it is not that the nigerian government does not care about its own people
perhaps they simply want to spare us the repetitiveness of their public statements and condemnations
the perpetrators of this dastardly act shall be brought to book
no stone shall be left unturned
god will punish them and their families
but who cares about words and worn out clichs 
action is what the nigerian people need
one year on the fact remains that despite predictions that they would be released imminently the more than two hundred missing girls have still not been found
the boko haram perpetrators rather than cowering under the fire of the nigerian armed forces have become bolder
more women and girls have been kidnapped
boys have been kidnapped
communities in the northeast of nigeria are being raided and razed on an almost weekly basis
it is also possible that the nigerian government's incertitude is being misconstrued as sluggishness or inaction
maybe they do not believe that things are as bad as is being widely reported by the international media
last year president jonathan's wife patience openly queried the veracity of the missing girls report
this week the nigerian defense ministry insisted that fewer than one hundred and fifty lives were lost in the baga attack as opposed to amnesty international's quoted two thousand
some nigerians i've listened to have also expressed their doubts about the two thousand figure
they believe that similar to the world bank's assertion that more than sixty seven percents of nigerians are living in poverty the baga reports are all part of the international community's grand conspiracy to taint nigeria to make our country look bad
they insist that the international media in their quest to excavate bad news from africa have simply latched on to an unverified casualty figure
unfortunately the nigerian media presumably not part of this grand international conspiracy are unable to provide us with enough alternative information
they are too busy covering the preparations for the forthcoming elections scheduled to take place in february
political rallies are beamed live on local tv and radio stations for hours every day
photographs of grinning politicians are splashed on newspaper front pages every morning their latest pronouncements and promises stealing all the headlines
current affairs programs and opinion pages are consumed with the adulation or derogation of either president jonathan or his main contender at the polls general muhammadu buhari
baga and other such will clearly have to take a back seat until after the elections
nevertheless the ongoing carnage in nigeria's northeast will definitely be a determining factor in the outcome of the february elections
a recent snap poll by nigeria's noipolls identified security as one of the key issues that nigerians want their president to focus on in two thousand and fifteen
i suspect that those nigerians who believe the relatively popular theory in certain ethnic circles that the rise in boko haram attacks are being orchestrated by unknown forces who want president jonathan out by all means will vote to keep him in just to prove a point to his enemies that their vicious efforts did not work
others who feel that jonathan is simply insensitive and incapable of handling the crisis will probably vote buhari
whatever happens at the polls nigeria has to at some point face the boko haram issue squarely even after the international media frenzy around the group's latest attacks has died down as it surely will

according to a recent study shipping accounts for around three percents of global co two emissions
not surprising when you consider that the engines of the world's estimated ninety thousand cargo ships are in use twenty four hours a day while traveling
futuristic concepts for container ships powered by alternative energy range from windmill powered propellers to banks of vertical metal sails
even though most are still on the drawing board one concept is starting to be viewed seriously by the shipping industry
called the vindskip the norwegian design uses the high sides of its container ships as sails turning the whole vessel into a wind assisted airfoil
designed by lade as the oslo based company says the hybrid merchant ship which would still have a liquefied natural gas powered engine could achieve fuel savings of sixty percents and reduce emissions by eighty percents
it's the brainchild of terje lade who used his skills as a speed sailor to develop his aerodynamic design
he says the futuristic container ship works more like an airplane than a conventional sailing ship
he said
in the era of christopher columbus for example he would have used what became known as trade winds but his ship was quite different from the vindskip because he would have been sailing with the wind he couldn't sail into the wind
vindskip can almost sail into the wind
in this way it's more like an airplane
it uses apparent wind or the sail wind to generate pull in much the same way that an airplane will take off when it reaches a certain speed
the ship would be able to point as high as eighteen degrees into the wind the vacuum created on the lee side of the vessel enough to propel the ship forward
critical to the design is computer software being developed by germany's fraunhofer center for maritime logistics and services which calculates the optimal sailing route based on the weather and prevailing winds
with this software you input when you want to leave and when you want to arrive the weather forecast is loaded into the program and then it calculates the best route lade said
this would be dynamically updated every day
at each waypoint it would check with the time arrival and tell the crew whether to speed up using the engines or slow down
it makes it very easy for the crew
the algorithms in the software also calculate the best angle to the wind to gain the maximum performance from the design
with our weather routing module the best route can be calculated in order to consume as little fuel as possible
as a result costs are reduced
after all bunker expenses account for the largest part of the total costs in the shipping industry said laura walther researcher at cml in hamburg
changes to regulations in the sulfur content of marine heavy fuels are set to make the price of bunker fuel typically among the heaviest and dirtiest of fuels in the distillation process more expensive
shippers traditionally favored polluting residual bunker fuels because they were cheap with large ships having the space to transport the pre heaters necessary to make the fuel volatile
but all that is about to change
current international regulations cap sulfur content at three point five percents but this is expected to drop to zero point five percents by two thousand and twenty
this makes things quite dramatic said lade
there are not many good solutions to this
at the moment they can wash the exhaust with scrubbers but on big ships this is very complex and very expensive
this is where the vindskip comes in due to the low fuel consumption it can run on lng which means there is no sulfur at all
one of norway's biggest shipowners wilhelmsen has already entered the project on a technical basis and while lade is quietly confident the world's first vindskip will slip into the water by two thousand and nineteen he says the global shipping industry had been slow to respond to his design
the big driving force in the vindskip project will be these new regulations on sulfur levels lade said
the big problem with sulfur is that it acidifies the sea and this means that shrimps and crabs can't form their shells said lade adding that acidification was impacting the entire marine ecosystem
it's very bad
something has to be done it can't go on this way
the danish shipping line maersk told cnn that it was pursuing innovations in energy efficiency as a solution in the here and now
in general we do not believe that wind assisted designs will play any significant role within the container shipping industry in the foreseeable future said maersk head of sustainability signe bruun jensen
the technology remains unproven at both commercial and operational scale
she said that maersk was developing its triple e vessels which used ultra long stroke engines efficient vessel shape and advanced waste heat recovery systems to improve co two efficiency by fifty percents per container
if you look at the technology already on board our vessels today it's remarkable just how far we've come she said

the executions were announced thursday by indonesia's recently appointed attorney general hm prasetyo who said in a statement that preparations for the executions were almost complete
he said the executions had been scheduled after petitions for clemency to indonesian president joko widodo were rejected late last month
widodo had previously told a university audience he planned to reject the sixty four appeals for clemency he had received from drug offenders on death row
the four men and two women to be executed hailed from brazil malawi nigeria the netherlands vietnam and indonesia said prasetyo
among them is brazilian marco archer cardoso moreira fifty three who would be the first of his countrymen ever to be legally executed abroad said leonardo monteiro counselor at the embassy of brazil in jakarta
the embassy of brazil is doing its best to try to postpone the execution he told cnn saying it was scheduled for this weekend
we are trying everything we can through the proper channels
brazil does not have the death penalty on its books he said
the condemned man had been in jail since two thousand and three after having been caught at jakarta airport with thirteen kilograms of cocaine he said
sentenced to death in two thousand and four he lodged a petition for clemency in two thousand and ten according to a statement from the attorney general's office
the government of the netherlands is also protesting the planned execution of indonesian born dutch citizen ang kiem soei who was condemned to death in two thousand and three for drug trafficking
the netherlands resolutely condemns the planned execution friso wijnen spokesman for the foreign affairs ministry of the netherlands told cnn adding that his government was making every effort to the highest level to prevent it
also sentenced to death and facing likely execution this year are the two australian ringleaders of the so called bali nine ring arrested in two thousand and five with more than eight kg of heroin
human rights groups have slammed the executions calling for them to be stopped
tackling rising crime rates is a legitimate goal of president widodo's administration but the death penalty is not the answer and does not work as a deterrent to crime said rupert abbott amnesty international's research director for southeast asia and the pacific
phelim kine deputy director of human rights watch's asia division accused indonesia of double standards in lobbying to prevent the execution of its nationals overseas but refusing requests by the brazilian government to extradite moreira to serve out his sentence in his home country
indonesia which has extremely strict drug laws carries out executions by firing squad
the country resumed executions in two thousand and thirteen after a four year break but no executions were carried out in two thousand and fourteen

the incident in colombes a community about ten kilometers northwest of the french capital began at about twelve forty five p.m. and was over two hours later
the gunman might be mentally unstable according to police in colombes
police said that they don't know yet whether the incident is related to terrorism
this is a hot topic in france after last week's deadly attacks
a western intelligence source said there could be as many as twenty terrorist sleeper cells of between one hundred and twenty and one hundred and eighty people ready to strike in france germany belgium and the netherlands
the gunman eventually surrendered and the hostages emerged with no injuries according to france bleu which is part of the country's public broadcasting group

quality control specialist asiainspection said forty eight percents of the several thousand inspections audits and tests it conducted in china last year failed to meet the requirements stipulated by some of its clients western food trading companies and retailers
there are horror stories obviously mathieu labasse asiainspection's vice president told cnn by phone
we find factories that just have no basic idea about hygiene standards
people that handle the food they have no gloves nothing
labasse said there was a host of reasons for the failings
in some cases laboratory tests found abnormal levels of pesticides antibiotics heavy metals bacteria or viruses that could put consumers at risk
other transgressions included mislabeling packaging abnormal coloring and odors bruising and in the case of seafood adding water to make the fish appear to weigh more than it does
china has experienced a string of stomach churning food scandals in recent years
the most high profile recent case involved a u.s. owned meat factory operating in china that was accused of selling out of date and tainted meat to clients including mcdonald's starbucks kfc and pizza hut chains
we see awareness growing but we don't see on the ground a concrete improvement yet it will come labasse said
labasse said the extremely fragmented nature of china's food chain the country has five hundred thousand food production and processing companies seventy percents of which have fewer than ten employees made it very difficult for authorities to control and foreign buyers to understand
companies like mcdonald's or kfc are dealing with their suppliers at arm's length
so they know well the people they communicate with on a daily basis but they don't know what's going on behind the scenes said labasse
the buyers are focusing their efforts on the people they signed a contract with but they should take the extra step and take control of the full supply chain and going as far as the third or fourth level of suppliers

the two suspects who died in the shootout are believed to have fought with isis in syria the source said
another man was captured but hasn't revealed any information
there also was a dire warning
not all the terrorists in the cell have been rounded up according to the source
belgian police have taken out part of the terror network plotting an attack in belgium but they have not yet taken down every component of it the source said
there is fear others may try to avenge the two men
authorities investigating the aftermath of the raid in which the men were killed found materials used to make bombs including chemicals for the powerful explosive tatp but the suspected terrorists had yet to assemble those weapons
they also had grenades
cell members had discussed attacking police in wiretapped phone conversations but belgian investigators still did not know what they were intending to target for sure the source said
the discovery of police uniforms after the raid suggested the possibility they may have been trying to gain access to sensitive sites
the source characterized the cell as one with organized structures a logistical support network and links back to syria and iraq
belgium is one of the nations participating in airstrikes in iraq and officials are concerned this plot is isis pivoting to launch attacks on the european countries involved in the military action against their troops in iraq
i think one of the things that's happening is we're seeing something that's surprising me
that is the pivot of isis philip mudd
a former cia counterterrorism official and a cnn analyst said
just last summer we were talking about how quickly isis was taking over geography
for a terrorist group to turn around in six or eight months and start training people for operations in europe is remarkable
in the raid in verviers a city of about fifty six thousand people police approached three suspects as they carried large duffel bags outside of a former bakery that might have been their lair a western intelligence source told cnn
the suspects immediately opened fire with multiple weapons prosecutors spokesman thierry werts said
police returned fire
two gunmen were killed and another was arrested federal prosecutor eric van der sypt said
that raid turned up four kalashnikovs handguns bomb making materials and police uniforms van der sypt said
van der sypt refused to name the two killed in verviers but said we have a pretty good idea who they were
answering reporters questions the prosecutor would not comment on reported plans by the suspects to abduct or behead any victims
the belgian counterterrorism source said belgian authorities had asked the cia for help in finding the director of the plot a belgian who was in greece
neither the cia nor greek officials were able to locate the man
he is described as a key link to isis in syria for the terror cell and once fought there
the two men killed in the shootout were among more than a dozen people rounded up in across the country raids designed to stop a group's allegedly imminent attack a plot to kill belgian police in streets and stations van der sypt said earlier friday
the alleged plotters including the two people killed thursday night in a battle with police in verviers were confronted in twelve raids across belgium from thursday into friday sypt said
could have been hours certainly no more than a day or two before terror attacks were to begin throughout belgium van der sypt told reporters of the alleged plot
besides the two killed seventeen have been arrested in the investigation thirteen in the belgium raids and four others in france including two who were detained while trying to cross from france into italy van der sypt's office said
investigators haven't found any links between the alleged belgium plot and last week's islamist terror attacks that killed seventeen people in paris the prosecutor said
but the belgium raids come amid fears of ongoing terror threats in europe as many as twenty terror cells with one hundred and twenty to one hundred and eighty people may be ready to strike in france germany belgium and the netherlands a western intelligence source told cnn
thursday night's raids were a dramatic culmination in a chain of belgian police investigations into an alleged terror cell that included people who had fought in syria van der sypt said
the u.s. intelligence community knew for weeks of the plot in belgium and was sharing critical information with belgian authorities several u.s. officials told cnn
the officials wouldn't say precisely what they knew how much they knew and when they knew it
there is concern those details could signal other militants planning other potential attacks
one u.s. official told cnn's barbara starr the entire developing plot was being monitored and watched
the official said we were aware
we were tracking this and added there is a high probability other attacks were being planned before the plots were disrupted by the raids
a european security source told cnn that belgian authorities arrested two men returning from syria over the weekend and interrogated them then decided to act quickly
the united states was aware of the timing of the belgian moves u.s. officials said
verviers is a little off the beaten path in eastern belgium the last stop before open fields and forest
like many european towns it's densely built
people live close together
the whole city must have heard the explosions and the gunfight according to resident frederic hausman
i can hear it
everybody can hear it he said
in this little city everybody heard the sound
from his window he could see police firing assault rifles at a nearby house
hausman recorded the assault on the house and posted it on youtube
the two who were killed were of north african descent the western intelligence source said
verviers is home to many people with moroccan roots according to a study by the nearby university of liege
immigrants make up more than eleven percents of the population with the largest contingent from other european countries
moroccans are the next largest group
verviers is about sixty nine miles east southeast of brussels and two hundred miles northeast of paris
the raids came as authorities monitored people returning from syria said werts the prosecutors spokesman
police had arrested questioned and searched neetin karasular a belgian suspected arms dealer allegedly aligned with isis and suspected of providing weapons to amedy coulibaly the man who attacked a paris kosher supermarket
karasular knew coulibaly's wife hayat boumeddiene who is also a terror suspect in france
karasular's lawyer michel bouchat said his client was facing local firearms charges and had no connection with any jihadi groups or terror plans
in the process police turned up names that solidified their suspicions about known persons the western intelligence source said
last weekend they arrested two more men at the charleroi airport as they returned from syria squeezed them for information then decided to act quickly the source said
the investigation made it possible to determine that the group was about to carry out major terrorist attacks in belgium imminently belgian prosecutor spokesman werts said
authorities believed the suspects in thursday's gun battle had been providing documents and weapons to men returning from syria the intelligence source said
a senior belgian counterterrorism official told cnn that the alleged terror cell is believed to have received instructions from isis
belgium is putting one hundred and fifty troops on standby for deployment in light of the increase in the country's terror threat level belgian interior minister jan jambon said friday
it has not been determined where they will be deployed he said
the threat level will stay at three for one month prime minister charles michel told cnn affiliate rtl
it is a way to mobilize all forces to raise security added
in france police also made at least twelve arrests friday in the probe of last week's slayings of seventeen people
additionally two people suspected of involvement with the alleged verviers suspects were detained while trying to cross from france into italy through the frejus tunnel a spokesman for belgium's federal prosecutor's office said friday
belgium is asking france to extradite those two said the spokesman who would not disclose the suspects names or nationalities
in neighboring germany police in at least two cities arrested men they accuse of supporting jihadis in syria
these suspects did not appear to be planning homegrown attacks german authorities said
the fear of terror was already high in western europe after the bloodbaths in france that followed multiple threats of attacks from isis the islamist group fighting to establish what it calls its islamic caliphate in iraq and syria and al qaeda in the arabian peninsula
aqap has claimed responsibility for the paris slayings
men claiming to be isis terrorists and speaking french promised new attacks in france belgium germany and switzerland in an online video found on thursday
isis has said it would lash out at european countries participating in bombardments in the middle east
more than three thousand europeans have left to fight in syria in recent years
authorities have long warned that those fighters could return and carry out attacks at home
british intelligence has also warned another islamist group in syria was planning mass casualty attacks against the west an apparent reference to the khorasan group
the belgian raids came against the background of a terror trial of dozens of men suspected of recruiting jihadists or trying to go to syria to fight
an antwerp court was to return verdict this week but postponed it due to the paris attacks

the people arrested are suspected of providing logistical support for the attacks
the arrests were made in the grigny and fleury merogis neighborhoods and those arrested were in amedy coulibaly's entourage the paris prosecutor's representative said
coulibaly was killed last friday in a police siege to end a hostage taking at a kosher supermarket in paris
he had killed four hostages and is believed to have shot a policewoman to death in the city a day earlier
two days before coulibaly was killed brothers said and cherif kouachi had attacked the offices of satirical magazine charlie hebdo killing twelve people and injuring eleven
they died the same day as coulibaly as police moved in to end a separate siege
there does not appear to be a command and control element to the paris attacks other than a general go forward and do something a western official with direct knowledge told cnn describing the attack as highly franchised terrorism with general instructions
the kouachi brothers legitimately aligned with aqap and cherif kouachi was associated with networks that brought him to yemen to train with the terror group but coulibaly's alleged connection with isis is still unclear the official said
aqap refers to al qaeda in the arabian peninsula
investigators are still trying to determine whether coulibaly coordinated with the kouachi brothers in the execution of the attacks or launched his own attack after learning of their actions said the western official
who were the victims 
france's frayed nerves will not be eased by the belgian authorities operation thursday to dismantle a suspected terror cell believed to be on the brink of carrying out attacks on police
however investigators have so far found no links with events in paris belgian prosecutor eric van der sypt said
meanwhile in the french city of reims about ninety miles northeast of paris the city hall confirmed friday that a police operation had taken place and that there had been gunfire
it's not clear whether this is related to the investigation of the paris attacks
however reims was the hometown of said kouachi
at the same time a man with a handgun entered a post office in colombes a northwestern suburb of paris according to the local police department
police said the man might be mentally unstable and that they did not know yet if this was terror related
according to french media there are up to five hostages inside the post office
in his first visit to france since last week's terror attacks u.s. secretary of state john kerry said that he really wanted to come here and share a hug with all of paris and all of france
standing alongside paris mayor anne hidalgo kerry added that he wanted to express to you personally the sheer horror and revulsion over what he called a living nightmare
american singer james taylor also appeared crooning a customized version of his one thousand nine hundred and seventy one hit song you've got a friend
kerry met earlier with president francois hollande when he voiced the full and heartfelt condolences of americans
we watched the people of france come together with a great sense of purpose and unity
it was a great lesson to the world that once again france's commitment to freedom and passion of ideas has made an important statement to the world kerry said
kerry laid a wreath at a makeshift memorial at the site of the kosher supermarket attack friday accompanied by foreign minister laurent fabius
kerry and fabius spoke there for several minutes with joel mergui the president of consistoire du paris a national jewish organization
kerry and fabius also paid their respects at the offices of charlie hebdo
francois vauglin the mayor of paris eleven th district where the offices are located told cnn that kerry's visit was very welcome
it's so important for us to feel supported at this time he said
the street is still cordoned off as investigators continue to comb the area for clues adding to the sense of disquiet for local residents he said
we know that the threat is still very high and we don't know how long we will be able to withstand this threat he said
president barack obama's administration has admitted it erred by not sending a senior figure to a huge unity march held sunday in paris
more than forty world leaders including the british german and israeli heads of state and russia's foreign minister joined at least one point five million people on the french capital's streets
the goodbyes continue after the attack on the charlie hebdo offices
funerals are being held for magazine editor stephane charb charbonnier illustrator philippe honore and algerian born copy editor mustapha ourrad
the question of where to bury their killers is more contentious
cherif kouachi's widow izzana kouachi has requested that both he and his brother said kouachi be buried in gennevilliers on the outskirts of paris
the gennevilliers mayor's office told cnn that the city was obliged by law to bury cherif kouachi there as he was a resident of the city
but a spokesman for the mayor jean francois boye said that it would not do the same for said because he lived in reims
that's for sure he's not from gennevilliers we won't let him get a funeral here boye said
a survivors issue of charlie hebdo was published wednesday the first since the attack
copies have flown off the racks of newsstands despite a print run of more than four million
however the magazine's decision to run a cartoon of the prophet mohammed on the front cover not for the first time has been criticized by a number of muslim leaders since this is deeply offensive to many muslims
anger over the cartoon boiled over into violence friday in pakistan where police resorted to using tear gas and water cannons to disperse protesters outside the french consulate in karachi
a pakistani photographer for afp was shot and injured at the protest the french news agency reported
he is doing better it said via twitter
ahmed chinoy chief of karachi's citizen police liaison committee told cnn that investigations were underway to determine who shot the journalist
at least two hundred protesters were involved in the violence which broke out after religious parties called supporters out to condemn the cartoon following afternoon prayers chinoy said
the protests come a day after pakistan's parliament unanimously passed a resolution condemning the caricatures printed in charlie hebdo
several french media outlets websites went down friday morning including those of radio station france inter newspapers le parisien and twenty minutes weekly magazines l'express and marianne and investigative publication mediapart
this prompted speculation that the outage could be the result of a hack linked to publication of the charlie hebdo cover
but internet service provider oxalide said it was not the result of a cyberattack
with france on its highest level of alert ten thousand troops have deployed across the country
thousands of police officers are on patrol including hundreds assigned to protect jewish schools
as france still reels from the shock of the paris attacks authorities in neighboring belgium swooped in on an alleged terror cell in an operation that left two suspects dead
prosecutor van der sypt said weapons and police uniforms were recovered as part of raids on a dozen properties in belgium in which thirteen people were arrested
the plan was to kill police officers on public roads or in police offices he said
two people were also arrested in france he said and belgium will be asking for them to be extradited
they are belgian nationals who belong to the alleged cell but were found in france he said
a western intelligence source told cnn that the ongoing terror threat appears to involve up to twenty sleeper cells of between one hundred and twenty and one hundred and eighty people ready to strike in france germany belgium and the netherlands
al qaeda in the arabian peninsula claimed responsibility wednesday for the charlie hebdo shooting
the attack was years in the making aqap commander nasr ibn ali al ansi said in a video claiming u.s. born cleric anwar al awlaki was the mastermind behind it
in the days since last week's attacks security services have been working to track those associated with the kouachi brothers and coulibaly
neetin karasular a suspected belgian trafficker in weapons who met coulibaly's widow hayat boumeddiene is in custody karasular's attorney michel bouchat told cnn on friday
karasular has been charged with association with wrongdoers and offenses relating to firearms in a case handled by the local public prosecutor's office in charleroi belgium
according to bouchat police didn't find any weapons at karasular's house
however the police investigation revealed that karasular used to spend time in a garage in charleroi where documents were found that mentioned weapons
according to multiple belgian media accounts these included documents about the type of gun used by coulibaly in the attack on the supermarket a week ago
bouchat told cnn that his client was not at all connected to thursday's police raids in belgium
according to the attorney karasular wasn't involved in any jihadi group
bouchat confirmed that karasular had previous convictions
how the kouachi brothers were radicalized

as many as twenty sleeper cells of between one hundred and twenty and one hundred and eighty people could be ready to strike in france germany belgium and the netherlands a western intelligence source told cnn
european union and middle east intelligence agencies had identified an imminent threat to belgium and possibly to the netherlands the source told cnn
there is a tremendous amount of concern over sleeper cells in europe said western official with direct knowledge of the situation
authorities worry about a rash of copycat attacks throughout europe according to the official who compared the problem to a slow motion car accident happening right in front of us
intelligence officials in europe were trying to determine the nature of the wider threat a senior european counterterrorism official told cnn
they were monitoring groups of men who have returned from fighting in syria
it is believed isis directed the men to return to europe to launch attacks in retaliation for airstrikes against the terror group in syria and iraq according to the official
overall authorities made seventeen arrests related to the belgium threat thirteen in belgium and four at two locations in france
here are the latest developments related to the terror threat in the west
the suspected islamist terrorists who had a shootout with police on thursday in verviers belgium have ties to isis linked cells in other european countries a senior belgian counterterrorism source told cnn's paul cruickshank
the two suspects who died in the shootout are believed to have fought with isis in syria the source said
a total of one hundred and twenty two thousand police officers gendarmes and military personnel are deployed across france as part of the security plan interior minister bernard cazeneuve said
there does not appear to be a command and control element to last week's paris attacks at the offices of charlie hebdo magazine and two additional locations other than a general go forward and do something the western official with direct knowledge told cnn
the attacks were highly franchised terrorism with general instructions
sectarian turmoil in yemen is bolstering al qaeda in the arabian peninsula's local recruitment and buying it space for attacks against the west and train the next generation of bomb makers according to one western diplomat
metropolitan police assistant commissioner mark rowley britain's senior counterterrorism officer said additional police patrols were being put in place at jewish community centers synagogues and schools
an eighteen year old woman was arrested at stansted airport near london on suspicion of terrorism offenses london's metropolitan police said on twitter
british prime minister david cameron called on his country and the united states to fight the poisonous ideology behind the terrorist attacks that killed at least seventeen people in france this month
britain and america both face threats to our national security from people who hate what our countries stand for and are determined to do us harm cameron said at a white house news conference with president barack obama
obama promised to do everything in our power to assist france in its effort to combat terrorism
two people suspected of involvement with the alleged terror cell in verviers were detained trying to cross from france into italy through the frejus tunnel a spokesman for belgium's federal prosecutor's office said
belgian federal prosecutor eric van der sypt said thirteen people were arrested in a dozen anti terror raids
authorities believed the threat of a terrorist attack was very imminent
the suspected terror cell which included people returning from syria planned to target police officers van der sypt said
police said they recovered weapons bomb making materials and police uniforms
at least a dozen people were detained in the paris region overnight in connection with last week's shootings in paris the city prosecutor's office said
two men in their early forty s were arrested in berlin on suspicion of links to isis police said
they did not appear to have been planning attacks
berlin police spokesman stefan redlich said the investigation had started a year ago
the police operation planned several weeks ago
the netherlands said it was not raising its terror threat level currently at substantial the second highest
that means there is a realistic threat but no concrete or specific information of an attack said government spokesman edmond messchaert
the current level of security in belgium will remain for at least one month and will then be evaluated to determine if it needs to be modified the country's prime minister said late friday
from the time we are confronted with an increase in the threat we went to level three on a scale of four
we must mobilize the resources available charles michel told cnn affiliate rtl
european counterterrorism agencies have been trying to identify and thwart potential threats after the deadly attacks in paris last week in which seventeen people were killed
security services are working to track those associated with the attackers
brothers said and cherif kouachi and amedy coulibaly
neetin karasular a suspected belgian trafficker in weapons who met with coulibaly's widow hayat boumeddiene is in custody karasular's attorney michel bouchat told cnn
karasular was charged with association with wrongdoers and firearm offenses in charleroi belgium
but his attorney said the arrest was not connected to the other belgian raids
coulibaly who attacked a kosher supermarket in paris last friday pledged allegiance to isis
however the kouachis the men who french authorities say carried out the deadly shooting at the offices of the french satirical magazine are believed to have had links to aqap which has claimed responsibility for the shootings
a european counterterrorism official told cnn that there were indications that isis leadership had directed returnees from iraq and syria to launch attacks in europe in revenge for syria and iraq airstrikes
the official who cited france the united kingdom and belgium as countries facing a particular threat said counterterrorism agencies in germany are on high alert
several european nations including the united kingdom france belgium and the netherlands are participating in the air campaign against isis in iraq

informed journalists share this concern
the climate crisis threatens the survival of our civilization said pulitzer prize winner ross gelbspan
mark hertsgaard agrees saying that the continuation of global warming would create planetary conditions all but certain to end civilization as we know it
these scientists and journalists moreover are worried not only about the distant future but about the condition of the planet for their own children and grandchildren
james hansen often considered the world's leading climate scientist entitled his book storms of my grandchildren
the threat to civilization comes primarily from the increase of the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere due largely to the burning of fossil fuels
before the rise of the industrial age co two constituted only two hundred and seventy five ppm of the atmosphere
but it is now above four hundred and rising about two point five ppm per year
because of the co two increase the planet's average temperature has increased zero point eight five degrees celsius
although this increase may not seem much it has already brought about serious changes
the idea that we will be safe from dangerous climate change if we do not exceed a temperature rise of two c has been widely accepted
but many informed people have rejected this assumption
in the opinion of journalist turned activist bill mckibben the one degree we've raised the temperature already has melted the arctic so we're fools to find out what two will do
his warning is supported by james hansen who declared that a target of two degrees is actually a prescription for long term disaster
the burning of coal oil and natural gas has made the planet warmer than it had been since the rise of civilization ten thousand years ago
civilization was made possible by the emergence about twelve thousand years ago of the holocene epoch which turned out to be the goldilocks zone not too hot not too cold
but now says physicist stefan rahmstorf we are catapulting ourselves way out of the holocene
this catapult is dangerous because we have no evidence civilization can long survive with significantly higher temperatures
and yet the world is on a trajectory that would lead to an increase of four c in this century
in the opinion of many scientists and the world bank this could happen as early as the two thousand and sixty s
what would a four c world be like 
according to kevin anderson of the tyndall centre for climate change research during new york's summer heat waves the warmest days would be around ten twelve c hotter than today's 
moreover he has said above an increase of four c only about ten percents of the human population will survive
believe it or not some scientists consider anderson overly optimistic
the main reason for pessimism is the fear that the planet's temperature may be close to a tipping point that would initiate a low end runaway greenhouse involving out of control amplifying feedbacks
this condition would result says hansen if all fossil fuels are burned
this result would make most of the planet uninhabitable by humans
moreover many scientists believe that runaway global warming could occur much more quickly because the rising temperature caused by co two could release massive amounts of methane which is during its first twenty years eighty six times more powerful than co two
warmer weather induces this release from carbon that has been stored in methane hydrates in which enormous amounts of carbon four times as much as that emitted from fossil fuels since one thousand eight hundred and fifty has been frozen in the arctic's permafrost
and yet now the arctic's temperature is warmer than it had been for one hundred and twenty thousand years in other words more than ten times longer than civilization has existed
according to joe romm a physicist who created the climate progress website methane release from thawing permafrost in the arctic is the most dangerous amplifying feedback in the entire carbon cycle
the amplifying feedback works like this
the warmer temperature releases millions of tons of methane which then further raise the temperature which in turn releases more methane
the resulting threat of runaway global warming may not be merely theoretical
scientists have long been convinced that methane was central to the fastest period of global warming in geological history which occurred fifty five million years ago
now a group of scientists have accumulated evidence that methane was also central to the greatest extinction of life thus far
the end permian extinction about two hundred and fifty two million years ago
worse yet whereas it was previously thought that significant amounts of permafrost would not melt releasing its methane until the planet's temperature has risen several degrees celsius recent studies indicate that a rise of one point five degrees would be enough to start the melting
what can be done then 
given the failure of political leaders to deal with the co two problem it is now too late to prevent terrible developments
but it may just may be possible to keep global warming from bringing about the destruction of civilization
to have a chance we must as hansen says do everything possible to keep climate close to the holocene range which means mobilize the whole world to replace dirty energy with clean as soon as possible

a jeddah court convicts raif al badawi of insulting islam and hands down a ten year prison term and one thousand lashes
prison for female driving death for dissent lashes for liberalism these are some of the punishments human rights groups say saudi arabia has handed down in recent months
a key ally in the u.s. led coalition against isis a terror group known to behead flog and crucify its victims saudi arabia faces accusations of hypocrisy for institutionalizing what some consider similar acts of barbarity
under the country's sharia or islamic law system these practices are acceptable ways to penalize criminals convicted by the saudi judiciary
the country's friends in the west are also under fire for meek condemnations after badawi endured the first of twenty consecutive weekly floggings in jeddah
canada is deeply concerned by the public flogging of raif badawi
this punishment is a violation of human dignity and freedom of expression and we call for clemency in this case canada's foreign affairs minister said in a statement
while mr. badawi is not a canadian citizen we will continue to make our position known both publicly and through diplomatic channels
the u.s. state department described the sentence as inhumane
in a statement it said
the united states government calls on saudi authorities to cancel this brutal punishment and to review badawi's case and sentence
the united states strongly opposes laws including apostasy laws that restrict the exercise of these freedoms and urges all countries to uphold these rights in practice
madawi al rasheed a professor at the middle east center of the london school of economics told cnn's becky anderson this week
none of those countries are willing to challenge saudi arabia as they challenge other countries deemed as opposed to the west
al rasheed said
the united states adopts double standards when it deals with a country like saudi arabia because of the importance of saudi arabia for u.s. interests and for european interest
the defiant gulf state says its judiciary is independent and impartial and bases its sentencing on islamic law a system freely and willingly chosen by the sovereign state
the kingdom is proud and cherishes islamic law and its constitutional curriculum where justice and the preservation of rights is ensured for all beings made by the almighty creator mohammed al muadi of the government backed saudi human rights commission told cnn
the riyadh government drew the ire of the international community when a video surfaced last year purporting to show a beheading by sword the predominate form of execution
the country executed eighty seven people in two thousand and fourteen most by decapitation human rights watch told cnn
the kingdom will not back down on the issue of justice the issue of applying the rules of god particularly in capital cases
and no sentence is carried out without providing the full legal right to the defendant said al muadi
under saudi interpretation of islamic jurisprudence charges of murder fall under a system of retribution which allows the family of the victim to choose the fate of the perpetrator
relatives may accept diyya meaning blood money instead of the death penalty
we emphasize respect for the right to life as one of the fundamental rights guaranteed by the law
it should not make us forget the rights of other parties violated by the perpetrators which has to be seen with the same degree of respect al muadi said when asked specifically about the practice of beheadings
last month saudi executioners cut off filipino worker carlito lana's head for killing his employer in two thousand and ten a cnn affiliate in the philippines reported
the lana family said the father of three acted in self defense
the department of foreign affairs of the philippines says that the family of the victim opted for the death penalty rather than accept any money from lana and initially tried to raise funds to pay the saudi relatives
this is a dark day for migrant filipinos especially for those on death row abroad a statement by the group migrante international which defends the rights of workers abroad said
the statement added that the case highlighted the vulnerability of migrant laborers
the scheduled flogging of raif badawi for blogging about the discussion of faith has begun
every friday he will be flogged fifty times until his sentence of one thousand lashings is complete
in the unverified video of the public act a man in uniform can be seen striking a shackled prisoner with a cane as a crowd gathers around
men in the crowd whispered he spoke about god and his prophet shortly before the flogging
badawi's wife ensaf haidar said the video was difficult to watch
it's a scene i can not describe
it was horrible she said from canada
every lash killed me she told cnn
the flogging again shines the spotlight on the nation that analysts say effectively manipulates its justice system to silence dissent and create strife among opposition on both sides of the aisle
u.s. officials have also called on saudi officials to withdraw the sentence and review badawi's case
but saudi arabia maintains its right to carry out their laws
raif badawi and others with charges against them are afforded all legal rights including the right to attorney said saudi arabia's mohammed al muadi
but analysts say it's as much about the internal conflict within the country
the case of raif al badawi tells us a great deal about the polarization in saudi society between the islamists and the liberals professor madawi al rasheed explained
the saudi regime tries to appease both by showing as if it is equal in punishing both groups that endorse discourse or opposition

zineb el rhazoui a writer with charlie hebdo said the cover means the magazine's journalists were forgiving the extremists for the killings
but the cover could also be interpreted as mohammed saying he forgives the cartoonists in a way the terrorists obviously did not
but the cartoons are somewhat irrelevant
as middle east analyst juan cole has argued they were just an excuse for islamic zealots to further widen and exploit the perceived gulf between islam and the west
cole writes al qaeda wants to mentally colonize french muslims but faces a wall of disinterest
but if it can get non muslim french to be beastly to ethnic muslims on the grounds that they are muslims it can start creating a common political identity around grievance against discrimination
enter the cartoons
this is why it is baffling that political voices around the world especially conservatives have argued that we must show our support for charlie hebdo and free speech by reprinting the magazine's offensive cartoons
remember this is a publication few outside france had heard of before it was targeted and even fewer had read and arguably one that many would have taken offense at in a different context
in fact in a line of thinking best articulated by new york times columnist and cnn contributor ross douthat the violent reaction to charlie hebdo's offensive cartoons not only justifies but also somehow demands that we not only continue but also ramp up that offense as a form of protest
if a large enough group of someones is willing to kill you for saying something then it's something that almost certainly needs to be said wrote douthat
in other words the violent reaction to something offensive not only retroactively justifies the offense in the first place but valorizes its rationale going forward 
some have indeed argued that because some radical islamists resort to violence it justifies not only broad offenses and smears of the entire religion but also thinking of such smears against islam as different from those directed at judaism or christianity
this ignores for example mass murderer anders breivik who left a one thousand five hundred page manifesto proclaiming himself one hundred percents a christian and advancing his vision of a monocultural christian europe
in two thousand and eleven breivik killed seventy seven people in norway
does that attack justify blasphemy against christianity and make it incumbent on all of us to increase such blasphemy as a form of protest 
the likely response that violence inspired by christianity or judaism is somehow an exception while violence inspired by islam is a rule i s merely a way of justifying in hindsight and in perpetuity smears against a group one has already decided to hate
as adam shatz at the london review of books has noted right wing fascists in france and europe more broadly share an organizing principle with jihadists
that there is an apocalyptic war between europe and islam
blanket incriminations of the whole of islam based on the acts of zealots help feed the premise
so do cartoons that blaspheme the prophet mohammed
though it's perverse to demand all muslims apologize or account for the acts of radicals within their faith since the paris attacks such demands have been made and plenty of moderate muslims have spoken out
and yet perhaps part of the reason we don't hear enough from these voices is that they simply don't fit the narrative fueled by the zealots in islam and the west and happily covered by the apocalypse loving media
this would also explain why the media and the west are still fixated on the slaying of seventeen people in france and paying infinitely less attention to as many as two thousand people killed in nigeria by boko haram
it falls outside the us versus them frame and is further evidence that as protesters in the united states have been asserting black lives simply aren't treated as though they matter
i unequivocally and unconditionally support the right to free speech
unfettered free speech is essential to any democratic and pluralistic society
so i support the right of charlie hebdo to print the most outlandish offensive cartoons it can come up with
and to give another example i support the free speech rights of french comedian dieudonn m'bala m'bala even though i personally find his anti semitic jokes even more offensive and sick than any of the charlie hebdo cartoons i've seen
still i don't think m'bala m'bala should be facing prosecution by the french government for his speech as he has apparently thirty eight times
curiously i don't see those rallying supposedly in support of free speech protesting m'bala m'bala's repeated prosecution
at the same time many of those supposedly proclaiming support for free speech are shaming and smearing media outlets that choose not to reprint the charlie hebdo drawings
the fascist right wing and fundamentalist islamists want the same thing
to convince muslims and the west that there is an inherent divide between the two
the question for the rest of us the ones who have free speech is whether we feed the apocalyptic narrative or fight it
a few fanatical islamists have horrifically and unimaginably offended the world
that's no excuse for anyone to go on offending all muslims
to do so only helps advance the terrorists goal

when that time comes a sigh of relief as crewmembers empty out the full bag onto the deck
stepping forward are jeannette anderson a cell biologist and robert johansen a marine biologist
the pile of dirt sea sponges and starfish from the ocean floor are what they came all this way for
above the arctic circle in the lyngen fjord of northern norway researchers on the helmer hanssen are searching for the next generation of antibiotics
in these sea organisms they hope are new bacteria to become those drugs
if no one finds new antibiotics for common infections what will happen is we will go back to the pre antibiotic age in which a simple cut could turn into an infection that becomes deadly said marcel jaspars
jaspars is the founder of the pharmasea project an eu funded initiative to bring research groups together around the world in search of new antibiotics
the world health organization says antibiotic resistance is a growing health crisis around the world calling it an increasingly serious threat to global public health that requires action across all government sectors and society
it is not cost effective for pharmaceutical companies to search for new antibiotics
on average it costs a pharmaceutical company more than two billion dollar to bring a new drug to market
in the case of antibiotics the drug is only taken for a short time and could eventually develop resistance
that's why large scale focus has moved away from antibiotics research in the past thirty years
in the meantime bacteria have evolved adapted and become resistant to many current antibiotics
what was once common treatments are no longer treatable by using standard antibiotics jaspars said
the key is finding new chemistry
bacteria can't be resistant to a drug if they've never seen anything like it before
extreme environments are providing new places to look
in the past bacteria and fungi have been the main sources for new antibiotics jaspars explained
in fact about seventy percents of our antibiotics still come from nature normally from sediment samples and soil samples from land
but now by looking at the ocean we hope to find new life forms which give us new chemistry that might be able to treat bacterial infections
that's exactly why anderson and johansen are on board the helmer hanssen
they are part of jaspars pharmasea team and they have identified the icy waters of the norwegian arctic as a potential breeding ground of new bacteria
in this extreme environment the sea organisms have been forced to adapt over time
they have to adjust for very different temperatures as compared to other parts of the world anderson said
we think that since they are living in an extreme environment they have developed some extreme strategies to survive
anderson and johansen take their finds from the bottom of the sea straight to a wet lab on the ship
it is critical to begin testing as soon as possible ensuring freshness of the organisms
johansen cuts open the starfish while anderson makes solutions to be plated on a petri dish
in a few weeks bacteria will grow on the plates hopefully exhibiting antibacterial properties
it is a long and tedious process with no time to waste
it often takes upwards of a decade for new drugs to be approved
it's a rush against time anderson said
i think we have to speed up the process of trying to find novel antibiotics
at the moment a lot of the antibiotics out there are working in the same way
the early results are promising
several compounds being tested in norway and at jaspars lab in scotland are showing initial signs of antibacterial properties
a good start with a long way to go but jaspars knows the hopeful legacy of the pharmasea project and others like is around the world is to eradicate the issue of antibiotic resistance
who knows where the next penicillin will be found 
perhaps it will be in the icy norwegian arctic
it is always very exciting when you get to the stage where you are the first person to see a bacteria said jaspars or the first person to identify the structure of a new molecule that has the potential at that moment to be a treatment for a difficult disease

on wednesday al qaeda released a video featuring nasr ibn ali al ansi one of its top commanders in yemen claiming responsibility for the horrific attack last week on the offices of the satirical magazine charlie hebdo
he gave two reasons for the attack
first he claimed it was in revenge for charlie hebdo's printing of cartoons lampooning the prophet mohammed
al ansi then went on to state in much greater detail that the attack was in response to france and the west killing muslims
we will tell you once again
stop spilling our blood
and then he urged muslims across the world to take vengeance for muslim blood spilled
well if spilling muslim blood is the deciding factor for us muslims to decide who we should take vengeance against then al ansi and others in al qaeda should immediately go into hiding
simply put al qaeda has been slaughtering muslims for years
islamic clerics doctors nurses women children etc
you name any type of muslim and al qaeda has butchered them
in fact a report released in two thousand and nine by the combating terrorism center at west point documented the people killed by al qaeda between two thousand and four and two thousand and eight
it found that only twelve percents of the victims of al qaeda were westerners
that suggests that al qaeda has killed seven times as many muslims as non muslims
and these attacks were just the ones for which al qaeda had publicly claimed responsibility
and since that report al qaeda in yemen has engaged in even more vicious attacks on muslims
keep in mind that ninety nine percents of the population of yemen is muslim so with a few exceptions virtually every person the group kills there is a muslim
in december two thousand and fourteen for example an al qaeda bomb killed fifteen children and ten adults when the bus they were on was blown up by an al qaeda car bomb intended for a competing militia leader in the area
this attack followed another in which al qaeda sent a suicide bomber into a crowd of protesters in the nation's capital killing forty seven people and injuring one hundred and forty
and back in december two thousand and thirteen al qaeda launched an attack on a hospital killing fifty two people and wounding one hundred and sixty seven with two car bombs before gruesomely shooting patients and doctors in the hospital
the list goes on but al qaeda is not alone in killing muslims who stand in its way
isis has done the same in iraq and syria
a u.n. report released late last year found that isis had killed thousands of muslims both sunni and shia between july and september of that year
this includes the slayings of three nurses in mosul iraq because they refused to provide medical care to isis fighters
isis also killed numerous sunni imams for refusing to swear allegiance to isis and beheaded another sunni leader for refusing to support the group
and the reality is that that's truly what al qaeda and isis are about
they are not about the concept of submit to islam or die as some have claimed
it's submit to isis al qaeda or die
both organizations clearly don't care how many muslims they kill
yet at the same time they will both claim they are carrying out their actions in the name of islam
in fact al ansi stated in wednesday's video that the terrorist brothers who carried out the attack on the charlie hebdo officers were two heroes of islam
he couldn't be more wrong
but that isn't to say there weren't heroes of islam in paris that day it's just that they are two quite different people
ahmed merabet was the french police officer shot in cold blood while lying on the sidewalk by the so called heroes of islam
as his brother stated at a press conference merabet was a proud muslim who gave his life defending french values of liberty equality and fraternity
and there was lassana bathily the muslim employee at the kosher deli in paris who reportedly saved the lives of seven jewish patrons by helping them hide when amedy coulibaly entered the store with guns blazing
bathily's actions exemplified the famous quranic verse whoever saves one it is as if he had saved mankind entirely
obviously calling out the hypocrisy of al qaeda and isis won't change these organizations goals they will continue to invoke islam as cover for their political ambitions because it helps them entice new recruits and raise funds which are vital for their continued existence
but maybe if their hypocrisy is consistently laid bare then it might help all understand the true motivation of these terrorist groups and hopefully even give pause to any muslims thinking of joining their un islamic cause
after all al qaeda and isis aren't interested in upholding the principles of islam
they are focused only on power however many muslim lives they take

it wasn't immediately clear why the cia acount posted the quote which appeared in cyrillic characters and according to google translate means

all of washington has been on high alert for twitter hackings after the account associated with the military's u.s. central command centcom was hacked on monday apparently by sympathizers of isis

the cia as an agency is notoriously secret but the social media team behind cia has shown itself to have a sense of humor often making jokes about secrecy and engaging with tweets about items from the cia's archives of spy paraphernalia and documents
for instance back in july they tweeted no we don't know where tupac is

they haven't yet tweeted quite as much about more timely matters like the senate intelligence committee's report on the bush era torture practices by the cia

do you think your husband is dead 
her mouth twists contorting her young face tears welling in her already reddened eyes
i don't know
i pray to god to give him another chance she finally manages to stutter
her sadness is heavy and blankets both of us
she tells me she has three children and they last saw their father four months ago when he went back to his army unit on the front line in nigeria's battle with the radical islamist extremist group boko haram
his friends last saw him bloodied and shooting as boko haram fighters advanced and they all fled
if all this wasn't trauma enough the young woman says the army has deserted her too
they didn't tell me anything they still haven't told me what happened and they didn't pay me anything and no one is feeding us in the barracks she said
we are in northern nigeria a few hours drive north of the capital where the mostly muslim north meets the mostly christian south
just last month a double suicide bombing killed twelve people in a busy central market in the region
driving northeast of here toward the borders with chad cameroon and niger puts you in the heart of boko haram territory a land mass the size of belgium
so it's no surprise that the area is home to many thousands of troops and as i am finding out it's also the backdrop of many more heart wrenching stories
a mile or so from his base i meet a soldier on a remote windswept hill
he is a veteran of african union and united nations peacekeeping missions in liberia and sudan a professional soldier
we sit on plastic chairs as he tells me his story
he too was left on the battlefield by his comrades as they fled for safety in the face of a boko haram attack
he doesn't blame them
the major problem the soldiers have is they don't have the equipment to fight he says
boko haram has anti aircraft guns which he says are accurate up to three quarters of a mile
all the nigerian military has he says are ak forty seven small machine guns accurate up to a few hundred meters
often the nigerian soldiers are given only sixty bullets each so they quickly run out
boko haram he says has large supplies of ammunition and more fighters
although the nigerian soldiers do win some fights he says they are regularly forced to turn tail and run for their lives by the sheer volume of gunfire from boko haram fighters
it took him three days on foot alone to get back to his base seventy kilometers away
when he arrived his wife told him to quit the army but his troubles were only just beginning
army medics refused to pay the two hundred dollar for medicine to treat his injuries
morale in the army is sinking he says
that night i meet a young officer who like the other soldier is not authorized to talk to me
our conversation is held in a hurry in a tiny darkened hut that sells biscuits and fizzy drinks at a roundabout on the outskirts of a town
corruption he tells me is the root of the nigerian military's problem
not just the generals
everybody in the country wants to get rich by any means necessary he says
the soldiers don't ever benefit from the billions allocated to the defense budget he explains
he even had to buy his own uniform
the troop morale is actually very low very low because we are not issued a uniform we buy the uniforms ourselves he explained
the other soldier i met on the hill told me this too
when they go into battle no one has the same uniform so when they run from boko haram it's chaos
they don't know who is friend or foe whom to shoot and whom to help
most soldiers live in fear the young officer tells me
a fear of what will happen to them and how long they can survive in this battle he says
the worrying doesn't stop there
they see enough war widows on the base to know the grim reality of what can happen to their loved ones if they die
a widow i meet explains
her husband was killed in battle over a year ago she tells me
when my husband died they never called me to tell me that i lost my husband she says
they buried him without notifying me
she gets no army pension and she says there are many more like her
they feel abandoned afraid to speak out because they still live in the barracks
government officials tell us they will look into these shortcomings that they are working on getting better weapons for the troops
if they do according to the soldiers i met it will easily turn the tide in this war

the pope made the gesture and accompanying remarks while flying from sri lanka to the philippines where he started a five day visit thursday
he didn't mention charlie hebdo the satirical magazine that was targeted by terrorists after it depicted the prophet mohammed in cartoons something that many muslims find offensive
the paris magazine became a terrorist target after publishing one such cartoon years ago and after last week's attack it placed mohammed on its cover this time showing him crying and holding a sign with the rallying cry je suis charlie french for i am charlie
still even if he didn't explicitly name the publication the pope was clear that he was referring to the general debate over what's happened in france including how people might react if they feel someone made a slight to their religious faith
everyone has not only the liberty but also the obligation to say what he thinks to help the common good francis said
however they should not do so if it offends people
and if someone does get offended 
the pope made reference to alberto gasbarri a man who organizes papal trips and was then standing next to him on the plane
if dr. gasbarri a great friend says a swear word against my mother then a punch awaits him francis said
it's normal it's normal
one can not provoke one can not insult other people's faith one can not make fun of faith
while making this comment vatican radio reported that the pontiff gestured with a pretend punch directed at gasbarri an action many journalists interpreted as a joke
notably in the same conversation francis steadfastly denounced the terrorists killings and the idea that anyone as the france attackers apparently did could pretend to justify such violence in the name of god
one can not make war kill in the name of one's own religion francis said on his way to the philippines

to kill in the name of god is an aberration
the vatican later responded to a cnn question about the punch remark specifically
in an email vatican spokesman thomas rosica told cnn that the pope's expression is in no way intended to be interpreted as somehow justifying last week's violence and he pointed out that the pope has spoken out clearly against the terror and violence that occurred in paris and in other parts of the world
the pope's words about dr. gasbarri were spoken colloquially and in friendly intimate manner among colleagues and friends rosica said thursday
his response might be similar to something each of us has felt when those dearest to us are insulted or harmed
rosica explained francis remarks as consistent with his free style of speech a plainspoken and conversational approach that has earned him admirers
such remarks must be taken at face value and not distorted or manipulated the vatican spokesman said
in fact the pope has been one of the world's most outspoken advocates for peace and against war since taking that position in two thousand and thirteen
and what he said on the manila bound plane doesn't change that according to rosica
pope francis has not advocated violence with his words on the flight the spokesman said

a western intelligence source tells cnn that the ongoing terror threat appears to involve up to twenty sleeper cells of between one hundred and twenty to one hundred and eighty people ready to strike in france germany belgium and the netherlands
the source said that european union and middle east intelligence agencies identified an imminent threat to belgium possibly also to the netherlands
a terror cell on the brink of carrying out an attack was the target of a raid thursday that left two suspects dead belgian authorities said
a third suspect was injured and taken into custody in the operation at a building in the eastern city of verviers prosecutor's spokesman thierry werts told reporters
a senior belgian counterterrorism official told cnn that the alleged terror cell is believed to have received instructions from isis
some members of the cell had traveled to syria and met with isis which plotted the attacks as retaliation for u.s. led airstrikes in syria and iraq the belgian source said
this was in the framework of an operation looking into an operational cell made up of people some of whom coming back from syria werts said
the investigation made it possible to determine that the group was about to carry out major terrorist attacks in belgium imminently
the operation which authorities said was ongoing added fresh fuel to a fear that's been simmering for months as thousands of europeans went off to join isis fighters in syria
would they bring the war back with them when they returned home 
frdric hausman was inside his house in verviers when he heard the explosions start
from the window he saw police officers firing assault rifles at a house nearby
he watched smoke rising after another explosion went off
then police entered the house hausman told cnn's erin burnett outfront
and even though he couldn't see exactly what happened next he heard it
i can hear it
everybody can hear it hausman said
in this little city everybody heard the sound
shouts gunfire and the sound of glass shattering echo in a video hausman posted on youtube
the suspects immediately and for long minutes fired using weapons and hand weapons before being neutralized werts said
verviers is about sixty nine miles east southeast of brussels and two hundred miles northeast of paris where terrorist attacks last week heightened alerts in europe
cnn affiliate vtm reported that the terrorism investigation in belgium started weeks ago and there has been no connection established with the paris attacks
a western intelligence source said the paris attacks played a role in accelerating the timing of the belgian operation
one reason
the arrest of a belgian arms dealer suspected of providing weapons to amedy coulibaly the man who attacked a paris kosher supermarket and also pledged allegiance to isis
belgian investigators questioned him and searched his possessions the source said
through the arms dealer the investigators got a number of positive hits on suspected extremists already known to authorities
but in the wake of the paris attacks the source said it stepped up the urgency
the trio targeted in the verviers raid had been under surveillance for some time werts said
additional anti terrorism operations are underway in other cities the belgian counterterrorism official said
in recent weeks european security services received indications of an ominous possibility
that isis may have started directing european extremists in syria and iraq to launch terrorist attacks back in their home countries the belgian counterterrorism official said
security agencies in several european countries were intensely investigating several groups of returnees from syria and iraq the official said including the group that authorities confronted in belgium
the belgian counterterrorism official said indications of isis ordering attacks in europe mark an apparent significant shift by the terrorist group
before the air campaign against it the official said there was little indication isis leaders were directly plotting attacks in the west
instead the group prioritized its project to create an islamic caliphate
the official named france the uk and belgium as countries facing a particular threat
counterterrorism agencies in germany also are on high alert because of the number of fighters who have traveled
several european countries including britain france belgium and the netherlands are participating in the air campaign against isis in iraq
why would isis change tack 
partly because of increased competition between isis and al qaeda affiliates including the khorasan group in syria to be seen as the standard bearers of global jihad according to the official
the official said there is also significant concern about khorasan attack plotting against europe
u.s. officials previously told cnn that french al qaeda operative and bomb maker david drugeon was suspected to be talent spotting european jihadis in syria for operations in europe
drugeon was injured in a drone strike in november but is believed to be still alive
last week andrew parker the head of britain's security service mi five warned a group of core al qaeda terrorists in syria is planning mass casualty attacks against the west an apparent reference to the khorasan group
european officials have been warning for months about the unprecedented challenge posed by returning fighters
more than three thousand europeans have left to fight in syria in recent years
the total number who have returned to europe is estimated to be over five hundred including two hundred and fifty who have returned to the uk almost two hundred to france and about seventy to belgium
several returning isis fighters have already been implicated in attack plans in europe
in february police in cannes broke up an alleged plot to bomb targets in france by ibrahim boudina a french algerian extremist who allegedly had just returned from fighting with isis in syria
police said they found almost a kilogram of the high explosive tatp inside soda cans in his family's cannes apartment building
screws and nails were attached to one with sticky tape as shrapnel according to sources briefed on the investigation
boudina has denied the allegations against him
mehdi nemmouche a french algerian isis fighter who allegedly helped guard western hostages in syria before returning to europe allegedly shot and killed four people at a jewish museum in brussels in may
nemmouche was arrested in france and extradited to face trial in belgium
he has denied the charges
in both the cannes and brussels plots investigators believe it is possible the men were acting on their own steam
no evidence has been publicly released suggesting isis leadership signed off on the plots
but the worry now is that isis has pivoted toward launching attacks in europe
european officials say all this adds up to an unprecedented terrorist threat in europe
late last year just weeks before the attacks on a satirical magazine jewish grocery and police officers in paris french prime minister manuel valls said france had never faced a greater terrorist threat
isis runs large training facilities in syria has deep financial pockets and access to thousands of potential european recruits

now the french government is helping out bathily by making him a citizen
the malian native's citizenship application which he filed in july will be expedited interior minister bernard cazeneuve announced thursday
cazeneuve will conduct bathily's citizenship ceremony himself tuesday
this event will add to what has been an emotional few weeks for bathily starting with his heroic actions friday after a gunman burst in while he was working at the kosher hyper cacher grocery store near paris porte de vincennes
the man took several people hostage but not the fifteen whom bathily led downstairs into a walk in freezer
bathily who describes himself as a practicing muslim told cnn affiliate bfmtv he switched off the freezer turned off the lights and told everyone to stay calm
i'm the one is going to go out the twenty four year old reportedly told the customers
i took the elevator and went upstairs
bathily told bfmtv that he went up after the hostage taker whom authorities have identified as amedy coulibaly asked us to all come upstairs
if they didn't 
otherwise he would kill everyone who was downstairs the young man said
so bathily did go upstairs taking a freight elevator
but he didn't go toward coulibaly
instead he ran outside
police apprehended bathily there and he told them the location of the freezer and gave details about those inside
when came out they congratulated me bathily told bfmtv
that's because his actions might have saved their lives
four people plus the gunman ended up being killed by the time the hostage situation ended
french media quickly ran with the story of bathily with l'express newspaper proclaiming lassana bathily malian muslim hero of the hostage situation in vincennes
people around the world also cheered bathily with about three hundred thousand signing a change dot org petition asking that he be given the legion d'honneur a highly prestigious award given to those who done exceptional things for france
even in darkness and desolation there's always a ray of light somewhere wrote the petition's creator thiaba bruni
such is the case with lassana bathily
such positive recognition was also all over facebook where a man who claimed to be bathily's cousin abdoul bathily posted lass bathily you showed courage yesterday
the rest of the world would not have done it
another person wrote i have no words to express my pride in you
you put your life in danger to save others
god saw all of it and his mercy will be without fault
you are blessed in the eyes of humanity

there are reports of a new accomplice in addition to the three gunmen killed by french authorities and the widow of one who escaped
there's a money trail that points to yemen and a cache of weapons reportedly found in an apartment
this all comes as a nation continues to mourn and parisians flock to newsstands in support of the satirical magazine targeted by the terrorists
everyone seems to want a piece of history
three million copies of charlie hebdo's first edition since the terrorist attacks flew off newsstand racks wednesday
another million or so went on sale thursday
the cover features a cartoon of the prophet mohammed crying as he holds a sign saying je suis charlie or i am charlie beneath the headline all is forgiven
this run of the magazine could reach five million copies
some have criticized the magazine's decision to depict mohammed however since this is deeply offensive to many muslims
the government of jordan condemned the move thursday saying that continuing to publish offensive drawings of mohammed would hurt the feelings of the muslim communities everywhere
this irresponsible act does not represent the freedom of expression which is based on the foundation of the responsibility and the respect of religions its statement added
freedom of expression is a right but there are limits when it comes to insulting faiths pope francis told reporters thursday referring to events surrounding the charlie hebdo attacks
one can not provoke one can not insult other people's faith one can not make fun of faith francis said on a flight from colombo sri lanka to the philippines
likewise he said people have religious liberty but one can't kill in the name of god
he said this after a reporter asked him about religious liberty and freedom of expression
francis noted that the reporter was french and he framed his answer with the paris attacks
you are french 
let's paris let's speak clearly
pakistan's national assembly on thursday unanimously passed a resolution condemning the publication of a caricature of the prophet mohammed by charlie hebdo pakistan's dawn news reported
the resolution also calls on the european union the united nations community and the organization of islamic cooperation take steps to prevent the publishing of such material according to the report
pakistan joins other predominantly muslim countries whose leaders have spoken out against charlie hebdo for its latest publication
prime minister muhammad nawaz sharif said that freedom of speech should not be used to hurt the religious sentiments of any community and that the world should discourage the publication of provocative material
more funerals for victims of the violence were held thursday
they included ceremonies for policeman franck brinsolaro charlie hebdo cartoonists bernard tignous verlhac and georges wolinski and columnist and psychoanalyst elsa cayat
all were killed in last week's attack on charlie hebdo's offices
magazine staffers and contributors were gathered for an editorial meeting when authorities said brothers said and cherif kouachi burst into the newsroom and gunned down staffers killing twelve and wounding eleven
one positive story emerged from friday's deadly siege at a kosher grocery store in paris just two days after the charlie hebdo rampage
it was that of lassana bathily a malian muslim immigrant and supermarket employee who said he helped some hostages into a walk in freezer at the store while it was under attack
on thursday french interior minister bernard cazeneuve said france would grant him french citizenship according to a statement
the french government expedited bathily's application which he filed in july two thousand and fourteen
cazeneuve himself will conduct the citizenship ceremony on january twenty
nearly three hundred thousand signatures have been added to a change dot org petition calling for bathily to receive french citizenship and france's prestigious legion of honor award
in a speech at the arab world institute french president francois hollande said that muslims are the first victims of fanaticism fundamentalism and intolerance and that islam was compatible with democracy
al qaeda in the arabian peninsula claimed responsibility wednesday for tcharlie hebdo shooting
the attack was years in the making aqap commander nasr ibn ali al ansi said in a video claiming u.s. born cleric anwar al awlaki was the mastermind behind it
al awlaki was the terror group's spokesman before a u.s. drone strike killed him in yemen in two thousand and eleven
for days intelligence analysts have been trying to piece together whether the kouachi brothers the gunmen who attacked the magazine met him on trips to yemen a theory that could be bolstered by the new video's claim
what is al qaeda in the arabian peninsula 
al ansi praised the magazine attack saying it was revenge for charlie hebdo's depictions of mohammed
u.s. authorities said they think the video is authentic
but they weren't ready to say that aqap helped carry out the assault
aqap did not claim responsibility for the kosher grocery store siege but praised it
it was a blessing from allah that the store siege in which four hostages were killed took place about the same time al ansi said
french security services have identified a suspected accomplice in that attack according to the french newspaper le parisien
police sources cited by the newspaper said one line of investigation is that the accomplice a man from a paris suburb may have driven gunman amedy coulibaly to the kosher supermarket where coulibaly later shot dead four people
coulibaly was killed in a police raid to end the siege
the kouachi brothers also are dead
but investigators efforts to track down possible suspects tied to last week's attacks are continuing
le parisien's report said investigators identified coulibaly's suspected accomplice using keys for a motorbike discovered in an apartment they raided over the weekend
neighbors told cnn the apartment in the paris suburb of gentilly was raided saturday by police
also found inside the apartment according to le parisien
a stash of weapons explosives and two isis flags
coulibaly purportedly told authorities before he was killed that he belonged to isis
police also think the suspected accomplice may have been responsible for shooting and wounding a jogger last week an attack that the paris prosecutor has said could be tied to coulibaly because the ammunition used was the same as ammunition found at the scene of the kosher market attack le parisien said
paris police would not comment to cnn on the contents of the report
le parisien says coulibaly's suspected accomplice whom the newspaper did not name may have fled france possibly for syria
officials have also said they believe hayat boumeddiene coulibaly's widow may have played a role in the attacks and has fled to syria
coulibaly and boumeddiene drove from france to madrid on december thirty one a spanish source close to the nation's security sources told cnn
coulibaly remained until january two when he returned to france while boumeddiene flew that same day from madrid to istanbul the source said
spanish security authorities are investigating what coulibaly and boumeddiene did while in madrid and are trying to determine where they stayed whom they had contact with and whether they had any support in spain
eyup serbest a reporter for hurriyet a turkish newspaper said that on january five two days before the charlie hebdo attack police searched the hotel where boumeddiene stayed in kadikoy istanbul
police took all the digital registration records on the hotel's computer including video recordings within the hotel
belgian federal prosecutors told cnn on thursday that a man is under arrest in charleroi in connection with arms trafficking
they said he recently bought a car from boumeddiene
prosecutors said the man was known to police but couldn't be directly linked to coulibaly
according to belgian media the man went to police after learning about last week's shootings
they then searched his house and found documents that matched the type of gun coulibaly used in paris
cnn has not been able to independently confirm the details of the raid on the man's home or the documents found after contacting police
u.s. officials have told cnn it's believed that when cherif kouachi traveled to yemen in two thousand and eleven he returned carrying money from aqap earmarked to carry out the attack
investigators said the terrorist group could have given as much as twenty thousand dollar but the exact amount has not been verified
french newspaper la voix du nord reports that coulibaly also secured funds that may have been used in the attack on the kosher supermarket
he got the loan for seven thousand dollar from the cofidis bank in villeneuve d'ascq in northern france
the paper reported the amount that coulibaly borrowed was not high enough to require an explanation of how the money would be spent
he took out the loan in december
u.s. president barack obama and uk prime minister david cameron are expected to discuss the paris attacks when they meet thursday and friday in washington
the two leaders pledged to safeguard our way of life in a jointly written opinion piece for the times of london
we will continue to stand together against those who threaten our values and our way of life they said in thursday's edition
along with our french allies we have made clear to those who think they can muzzle freedom of speech and expression with violence that our voices will only grow louder
with france on its highest level of alert ten thousand troops have deployed across the country
thousands of police officers are on patrol including hundreds assigned to protect jewish schools
since the attacks dozens of cases have been opened in france against people accused of expressing support for terrorism the justice ministry said
it's unclear how many people are blamed for the fifty four infractions
the cases include investigations involving phone threats cyberattacks and facebook posts the ministry said



earlier the country's military said that nigerian soldiers had thwarted a boko haram attack on wednesday in the town of biu in the restive northeastern section of the country
critics have accused jonathan's government of not doing enough to address the insurgency which mostly affects opposition strongholds
nigeria is holding presidential elections in february
earlier this month jonathan launched his re election bid in a raucous rally in lagos
the nigerian defense headquarters said five terrorists and two anti aircraft guns had been captured
officials gave no casualty tolls but residents told cnn that at least forty boko haram fighters were killed when they were surprised by nigerian soldiers and fought a lengthy gun battle
scores of boko haram militants in ten pickups and two motorcycles attempted to storm the town two hundred kilometers south of the borno state capital maiduguri around seven thirty a.m. local time
they were intercepted by soldiers from nearby military barracks leading to two hour gunfight residents said
dozens of troops lay in wait for the militants and opened fire on an advance team of three pickups carrying the gunmen near an airstrip two kilometers outside biu residents said
soldiers killed forty boko haram insurgents and foiled their attempt to take over the barracks and attack the town said biu resident mahmud bukar
all thirty gunmen in the three vehicles were killed by the barrage of gunfire from the soldiers
the remaining gunmen who had camped at a gas station in nearby kigir village mobilized and faced the troops in a fierce battle that lasted two hours said bashir babagoni another resident
the gunmen were overwhelmed and forced to retreat in disarray according to witnesses
soldiers aided by local vigilantes went on their trail in the bush while youths armed with crude weapons set up barricades in different parts of the town to prevent infiltration by the gunmen
residents trooped to the scene of the fighting to see the dead gunmen and their bullet riddled vans babagoni said
biu is a religiously mixed town and the largest in southern borno
it is an important commercial center that includes a large military base
although boko haram has carried out several raids on villages in the area in the past two years biu has never been attacked residents said
boko haram has terrorized northern nigeria regularly since two thousand and nine attacking police schools churches and civilians and bombing government buildings
the islamist group has said its aim is to impose a stricter form of sharia law across nigeria which is split between a majority muslim north and a mostly christian south
last week it brutalized a town and some villages near the border with chad killing hundreds perhaps thousands of people
human rights watch said it acquired satellite imagery that shows the results of fires set by boko haram
the rights group said eleven percents of baga and fifty seven percents of doro gowan were scarred by the flames
boko haram's brutal tactics have shocked and stunned the world
it has kidnapped students including more than two hundred schoolgirls who were abducted in april and remain missing
it has also strapped bombs to young girls and ordered them to blow themselves up in markets according to one teenager who said she refused and fled the scene of an attack




loose stones tumble from the tops of the walls far up on the hilltop
all around me tree limbs shake
it's just after dawn and i'm alone climbing the trail to the fifteen th century royal compound on the hilltop at great zimbabwe in southern africa
alone except for the baboons
like all the stone structures here the stairwell is open to the sky but the incline is so steep and the curves so sharp that i can't see more than ten feet in front of me
sure enough around the next bend a baboon is waiting for me on one of the dozens of terraces that skirt the hillside
we watch each other for a few moments until i'm certain he's not interested in me and then i keep walking
baboons freak me out but these moments are part of what makes great zimbabwe such an incredible place to visit
unlike the world's more visited ruins which is basically every other ruin here it's easy to lose yourself in the mystery of the place even if that means the occasional standoff with a baboon
the stairwell leads to a narrow passage through a cleft in the rocky hilltop
stone walls that form the perimeter of the royal complex tower overhead
they once would've extended even farther out over the stairs but a terrace collapsed since the city was abandoned bringing a wall down with it
it's hard to find a vantage point to see the entire complex
the old city which was the capital of a trading empire and home to ten thousand people in the one thousand four hundred s stretches over one thousand eight hundred acres
essentially the hilltop functioned as a palace and cathedral the center of political and religious power
on the planes below circular stone walls form a series of enclosures
the most iconic aptly called the great enclosure is the largest pre colonial structure south of the sahara
the walls rise up thirty six feet and stretch eight hundred and twenty feet around
at one end an inner wall forms a narrow passage that leads to a conical tower the most distinctive landmark in the old city
i like the hill complex more
here the walls curve around each other and the granite boulders which are incorporated into the design
different chambers are linked by a labyrinth of narrow passages that snake up and down over the giant rocks
at the far side is a chamber with a towering stone ledge that once held a small stone wall that acted like a balustrade
like all the structures here the stones were assembled without mortar
each layer was slightly recessed creating a slope that held it all together
over the centuries some walls were knocked down by treasure hunters or just by the elements
the chamber below is where a famous set of carved birds were found
most of them are now housed in a small museum inside the park which is worth a visit if only to see them
the image of a bird appears on the national flag and is as much a symbol of zimbabwe's national identity as the statue of liberty is to the united states
there's a good chance of being here alone
visitors might see schoolchildren passing through on their way to class or the occasional park worker but not many other visitors
tourism in zimbabwe has been in a long and slow recovery
in the one thousand nine hundred and ninety s zimbabwe was for a moment the most visited country in sub saharan africa
by the time the nation hit rock bottom in two thousand and eight hardly any foreign visitors came
now major attractions like victoria falls are bouncing back but places like great zimbabwe have fallen far off the radar
the ruins are easily accessible by road but it takes several hours from harare or a full day from johannesburg so not many people make the effort
but this is a place i love returning to
in the colonial days when zimbabwe was known as rhodesia white families used to vacation here and remnants of those days remain
the national park has simple rondavel huts for hire and there's the dated but charming great zimbabwe hotel just outside the gates as well as the posher safari style lodge at the ancient city
the inn's restaurant where the buffet is designed like the stone walls serves lucky travelers fresh bream from the nearby dam
if not there's almost always a fisherman selling his catch on the roadside which can be grilled outdoors or ask the restaurant to prepare it
on my latest trip i went with an excursion organized by the wits school of arts at the university of the witwatersrand in johannesburg
those going on their own can hire a guide on site
every guide i've ever had here has been articulate and charming and well informed but it's even more amazing to spend a few days exploring the ruins with people who actually wrote the book on great zimbabwe
you can find their offerings at wsoa.wits.ac.za under history of art
practical tips
zimbabwe has started an online visa system which isn't working at the time of this writing
when it does applying online will get visitors a letter that they must present on arrival which is when the visa is actually issued
those that require a visa might be better off simply getting it on arrival
anyone driving up from south africa can save themselves a lot of hassle at the border by contacting the zimbabwe tourism authority ahead of time
they can arrange to have an officer to wait at the border post and walk visitors through the immigration and customs process
this can save hours and endless headaches
and it's a free service

in one thousand nine hundred and ninety one four year old sun bin was taken by child traffickers from his hometown in sichuan province and sold to a family thousands of miles away in jiangsu province on the country's eastern coast chinese state media reported
on tuesday sun was finally reacquainted with his sixty year old father sun youhong and a younger sister he had never met
the moment was captured in a moving series of photographs
i was happy
i was grateful the father said
but i was also bitter
child trafficking is still a major business in china as traffickers seek to profit off a growing demand for healthy babies from potential adoptive parents in china and elsewhere
boys prized because they carry on the family line are in great demand and fetch higher prices
earlier this week chinese police said they had rescued thirty seven newborn babies after busting a trafficking ring that sold the babies for up thirteen thousand dollar each
the reunion tuesday took place at a police station in chengdu
when a police officer introduced sun bin to his father the twenty eight year old dropped to his knees and wept in his father's embrace
you're a man
don't cry said the elder sun according to a report released by the state news agency xinhua
sun bin was just a toddler when he disappeared at a vegetable market in one thousand nine hundred and ninety one
sun youhong said that he and his wife had dropped everything to search for him
he said they posted search notices around the area and sun bin's mother traveled to other cities in sichuan and neighboring provinces
sun bin's mother was diagnosed with cancer in one thousand nine hundred and ninety six and died in two thousand and eleven
to find our son had been my wife's biggest wish in life sun youhong told xinhua earlier this week
and days before she passed away she was constantly murmuring our son's name
sun bin told chinese journalists he had always thought he was adopted but he didn't know where his original home was
he said he had never asked his adoptive parents how he ended up with them
as he grew older he said his wish to find his own family had become stronger and stronger
he left a dna sample with a local police station in jiangsu in october two thousand and fourteen and recently received a phone call saying that a match had been found
the family also received assistance from a chinese web site called baby come home which helps reunite separated relatives
the elder sun said he was disappointed to learn that his missing child had been put to work as an electrician when he was still a teenager
i would have kept my son in school at the age of fifteen he said
in a phone interview with cnn the father accused his son's adoptive parents of breaking the law for accepting a kidnapped child
but as long as my son comes back to live with me i won't press charges against them he added
sun bin has yet to make a decision of whether he will leave the adoptive coastal town where he was raised
for now he is sleeping for the first time in twenty four years in the home of his biological father

the pope stressed that there was no justification for the killing of seventeen people in three separate incidents including a massacre in and around the offices of satirical magazine charlie hebdo
the assailants were reportedly islamist extremists some of whom called out allahu akbar which is arabic for god is great as they singled out the magazine french authorities and jewish people
one can not make war kill in the name of one's own religion francis said on his way to the philippines

to kill in the name of god is an aberration
still even as he decried the violence and generally spoke in support of freedom of expression the pontiff said that such freedom must have its limits
he didn't mention charlie hebdo specifically or its cartoon depictions of mohammed something that many muslims find offensive
a previous cartoon was one reason the paris magazine was targeted and it didn't back down afterward with its post attack cover showing mohammed again this time crying and holding a sign with the rallying cry je suis charlie french for i am charlie
still even without talking about the magazine by name the pope prefaced his remarks by saying let's go to paris let's speak clearly
he then referred to recent violence there as well as the debate about freedom of expression
francis said on his flight from colombo sri lanka to manila that everyone had not only the liberty but also the obligation to say what he thinks to help the common good
but he added that this should be done without giving offense because human dignity should be respected
if a friend says a swear word against my mother then a punch awaits him francis said
vatican radio reported that he then gestured with a pretend punch directed at the friend alberto gasbarri an action that many journalists interpreted as a joke
vatican spokesman thomas rosica later told cnn the remark was spoken colloquially adding the pope wasn't advocating violence or in any way justifying the terror attacks
right after the punch gesture francis said it's normal it's normal
one can not provoke one can not insult other people's faith one can not make fun of faith
later francis arrived in the philippines asia's most catholic nation and one hungry for his arrival
everything from the country's supreme court to backstreet businesses have closed down but the streets have come alive
people have been pouring into the capital from all over the country to greet the head of the catholic church as he starts his five day visit
on street corners in malls on public transport it's impossible not to feel the presence of the pope
giant billboards with an official red and blue pope logo adorn many of manila's buildings while curbside vendors sell images of his smiling face on everything from stamps and towels to fans and key chains
filipinos have been granted a national holiday for the visit the coast guard has declared a no sail zone within a mile of manila bay many of the capital's main roads will be closed and manila's airport has limited its operations
an estimated forty thousand security personnel will be deployed to keep the pope safe during his time in manila and leyte where he will celebrate mass in tacloban a city still coming to terms with the devastation caused by typhoon haiyan a year ago
pope francis visit is being billed as one of mercy and compassion
but in a country where a conservative church has fought strongly against legislation allowing government distribution of birth control as well as the legalization of divorce some filipinos hope this pontiff's more open minded approach might lead to change

cardinal
pope says visit not about him
young people such as john laureta a twenty four year old student who is traveling six hours to see the pope in the capital says he's the kind of leader in the church that the young need
he's approachable listens and answers questions explains and does not ignore questions that are controversial he said
ginelle peterson also twenty four agreed
since he is not so black and white it makes us think i want to hear more of what he has to say about this she said
indeed for many people in the philippines having a head of church with these qualities is welcome
anthony j. vizmanos twenty five was asked to leave his home when he came out as gay to his deeply religious parents
he said he still prays goes to church and receives sacraments but has been driven away by what he calls irony in the church's teachings
the church says it's ok to be gay as long as you don't engage in homosexual acts
but if you say you accept us for being gay then why are you stopping us from acting gay 
we are not plants that photosynthesize
we need love and affection too

ne woman who described herself as a modern catholic but preferred to remain anonymous said the vatican hierarchy needs to be revamped
the pope is introducing changes that the ancient church needs to keep in step with the twenty one st century
there are too many antiquated irrelevant rules that turn off the youth
this pope is a breath of fresh air
the church's staunch position on artificial birth control that it's a sin and will relax moral standards is an example
a woman should have the right to decide what form to use to prevent unwanted pregnancies she added
birth control is not abortion
vizmanos says he feels the church in the philippines is less tolerant than the pope and hopes its clergy will become more moderate after his visit
a priest near my home says in each homily that gay people are condemned to damnation he said
i hope the pope can shed some humility to people like him
the church here is too rooted in their causes whereas the pope is more accepting
one of the most divisive issues in the philippines in recent years is a controversial bill that addresses birth control
the reproductive health bill which allows the government to distribute and educate the public about artificial birth control finally passed last year after a fourteen year battle but the fight with the church and more conservative elements in the philippines over its implementation continues today
christine gomez forty eight who works for a women's youth organization does not believe in divorce or birth control
of course we have problems but introducing these things will not solve them
it's better to educate people in virtues like chastity or fortitude learning to face difficulties without giving up easily
although media have widely reported the pope making what could be considered more liberal comments about controversial issues such as birth control homosexuality and divorce which is illegal here he has not actually made any changes to church policy
father catalino arevalo a prominent filipino theologian says pope francis has just started changing how he handles his people
he just said that you should openly discuss these things
let everybody have the chance to talk
but then when the discussion is over he and his advisers will make a decision but the decisions have not been made
catholics like ginelle peterson hope that the pope's progressive approach may one day lead to the right to divorce
but teodoro bacani jr. bishop emeritus of novaliches says divorce which critics say will ruin the family a cornerstone of filipino life and faith is something that will never be allowed

the fight to make divorce legal
i don't think the pope will even hint to filipino bishops and say
hey guys soften up on this will you 
because this would not be in accord with the catholic spirit and teachings
i am sure he will never agree to gay marriage either he said
peterson says he believes it's about trust and being open to different interpretations
don't you trust your people enough to give them a choice 
if i was solid in my faith and didn't believe in divorce then i would not do it she said
you can't define a family from the dictionary
does that mean if you grew up with just a father that it's not family 
that you were not taken care of or protected or loved

pope francis says philippines visit not about him 

some of the corpses were half burnt and many just skeletal remains said saumya agarwal the chief of the riverside district of unnao where the bodies were recovered
most of them are believed to be very old
in hinduism and some other indian faiths funerals are conducted by cremation
the ashes are then scattered into rivers
the ganges hinduism's holiest river is dotted with numerous cremation spots along its shores
a full hindu funeral costs up to seven thousand rupees agarwal said
sometimes poor people cremate their dead with limited firewood as a ritual and float the partly burnt bodies into the river she said
many people also bury dead children and unwed women in graves along the river
these bodies and decomposed skeletons from dismantled graves surfaced when the water level dropped as low as to the riverbed she said
all remains have now been buried in the riverbed at the same site agrawal added

india has also launched what it calls a national mission for clean ganga involving various stakeholders including religious figures and environmentalists

as they've trickled out accounts of the bloody attacks on the northern nigerian town of baga and surrounding villages have shocked even those all too used to reports of violence by boko haram militants
witnesses told how the attackers sped into the town on january three with grenade launchers their gunfire and explosions shattering the early morning calm
some terrified residents fled while others took refuge in their homes and were torched with them
local officials reported death tolls ranging from hundreds to as many as two thousand people
but authorities have yet to access the remote area near the border with chad to get a full picture
amnesty international said that satellite images taken on january two and five days later provide indisputable and shocking evidence of the extent of the destruction in baga and neighboring village of doron baga also known as doro gowon
the before and after images demonstrate that the attacks left more than three thousand seven hundred structures damaged or destroyed the rights group said
more than three thousand one hundred of those were in doron baga which was nearly wiped off the map it said
other nearby towns and villages in borno state were also targeted in the series of attacks that started on january three
these detailed images show devastation of catastrophic proportions in two towns one of which was almost wiped off the map in the space of four days said daniel eyre nigeria researcher for amnesty international
of all boko haram assaults analysed by amnesty international this is the largest and most destructive yet
it represents a deliberate attack on civilians whose homes clinics and schools are now burnt out ruins
many of the wooden fishing boats that can be seen along the shoreline in the images of doron baga from january two are gone in the later images the group said
this agrees with witness accounts of desperate residents fleeing by boat across lake chad
another rights group human rights watch has also published satellite imagery that it said showed the results of fires set by boko haram
the rights group said eleven percents of baga and fifty seven percents of doro gowon were scarred by the flames
asked by cnn about the amnesty satellite images mike omeri coordinator of nigeria's national information center said this is a government that analyzes any and all sources of information
amnesty international last week described the massacre as possibly boko haram's deadliest act yet
the nigerian military said that description was quite valid
the attack on the town by the bloodhounds and their activities since january three should convince well meaning people all over the world that boko haram is the evil all must collaborate to end it said
nigeria's government has called for boko haram to be seen as a problem requiring a concerted international response as seen after the terrorist attacks in paris last week
on wednesday a new message surfaced from boko haram's leader abubakar shekau in which he praised again and again the deadly rampage at the charlie hebdo offices in france
nigeria has always said this is a global challenge and viewed as such requires global military action said omeri
the combatants we capture are often not even nigerian
they don't even speak our languages
what started as copycat attacks is now a newly devised network
the government has come under fire from critics who say president goodluck jonathan is more interested in campaigning for the presidential election next month than in dealing with the problem of boko haram
soldiers who spoke to cnn in northern nigeria painted a troubling picture when asked about their efforts to take on the islamist extremist group
they said boko haram outgunned and outnumbered the military on the battlefield
while the militants are equipped with anti aircraft guns on the backs of trucks that have a range of three quarters of a mile they have only ak forty seven weapons with a range of a few hundred yards the soldiers said
adding to their difficulties they are issued only sixty bullets when they go into battle they said while the boko haram fighters have many more
many soldiers also have to buy their own uniforms and lack protective gear they said
morale is low and this is one of the reasons that boko haram is making gains on the battlefield they said
responding to the claims that the military is outgunned omeri said
nigeria is in the process of acquiring new equipment and we will continue to intensify those efforts
in a rare piece of good news nigerian soldiers thwarted a boko haram attack wednesday in the town of biu in southern borno state the military said
the nigerian defense headquarters said five terrorists and two anti aircraft guns were captured
officials gave no casualty tolls but residents told cnn that at least forty boko haram fighters were killed when nigerian soldiers surprised them and fought a lengthy gun battle
omeri said we've always said this is an ongoing process
we're happy that this success has come in quick succession to baga
we hope more will be achieved
the continuing violence has displaced many people from their homes
of the thirty thousand people displaced during the attacks around baga twenty thousand camped in maiduguri city capital of borno state while another ten thousand headed to monguno town nearer baga
others were stranded on kangala island on lake chad
these people are adding to the hundreds of thousands of internally displaced people and refugees who have already stretched the capacity of host communities and government authorities amnesty international said
amnesty international is calling on the governments of nigeria and chad to ensure these displaced people are protected and provided with adequate humanitarian assistance
boko haram has terrorized northern nigeria regularly since two thousand and nine attacking police schools churches and civilians and bombing government buildings
it has also kidnapped students including more than two hundred schoolgirls who were abducted in april and remain missing
the islamist group has said its aim is to impose a stricter form of sharia law across nigeria which is split between a majority muslim north and a mostly christian south


in the video the boy who has been identified as abdullah in prior isis videos sports long hair and wears a black sweater and military fatigue pants
he stands behind the two men who are kneeling and shoots them in the back of the head in a theatrically produced video with slow motion
the boy stands over one of the bodies fires two more times and later raises his pistol high
cnn can not verify the authenticity of the video but it appears to be the first time isis has shown a child carrying out an execution
the video's title is uncovering an enemy within and states that enemies thought that they could dispatch spies and agents to plot against the islamic state but allah disgraced their efforts and thwarted their plans
everything to know about the rise of isis
the islamic state in iraq and syria is using warfare and terror in an attempt to create an islamic state or caliphate across the sunni areas of iraq and in syria
isis has featured children as fighters before calling them the cubs of the caliphate a play on words referring to how jihadis are called lions
isis has encouraged foreign fighters to bring their families and has taken over schools to indoctrinate children
in june human rights watch documented the experiences of twenty five children and former child soldiers in syria's civil war and asserted that nonstate armed groups have used children as young as fifteen to fight in warfare and used others as young as fourteen in support roles
isis and other extreme islamists have specifically recruited children through free schooling campaigns that include weapons training and have given them dangerous tasks including suicide bombing missions the rights group said
in earlier isis videos the boy named abdullah says that he's from kazakhstan and wants to grow up to kill infidels
he appears to be asian
isis has used shocking imagery of children in the past
in august a seven year old australian boy held a man's severed head reportedly in the isis held town of raqqa syria
the photo was posted on twitter by his australian father khaled sharrouf who wrote that's my boy
the international community condemned the incident and photograph
the london based syrian observatory for human rights said russians did infiltrate syria in late december and made up the majority of nineteen men who went to the isis held area of al ra'i
the observatory is an activist group opposing the syrian government embroiled in a civil war where isis has established strongholds
the video shows the two men being questioned by someone off screen and they identify themselves as mamayev jambulat yesenjanovich thirty eight who was born near jambul kazakhstan and ashimov sergey nikolayavich thirty
both men say they are informants for the russian intelligence service
in the questioning of the thirty eight year old man the video states that service as fsb or russian's federal security service
the russian state security organization could not be immediately reached for comment wednesday
the russian state news agency ria reported that the fsb and the russian embassy in syria refused to comment on the situation
on january four ramzan kadyrov the head of the chechen republic told the news agency interfax that russia has an intelligence network within isis
when asked whether there was an isis terrorism threat in chechnya kadyrov stated
there is no threat
we are scaring ourselves with isis
within the ranks of hordes of terrorists we have a good intelligence network
this allows us to track the movement of those who are of interest to us
moreover it allows us to send those who even as a joke direct the barrel towards russia on an eternal trip with a one way ticket
the anatomy of isis
how it is run

when the sound of gunfire rattled out of the offices of charlie hebdo in paris it looked like the systematic murder of cartoonists and staff at the satirical magazine could have been the work of lone wolf extremists two brothers named said and cherif kouachi
when a policewoman was gunned down the next day police first thought the incident was unrelated
but when that gunman amedy coulibaly took hostages at a kosher supermarket the next day demanding that police stand down from a siege of the kouachi brothers happening just outside the city a web of connections started to become clear
and as investigators look into the horrific events that shook france and the world this month it becomes clear that the links spread from paris out to yemen syria iraq and beyond
a week after the charlie hebdo killings al qaeda's yemen affiliate al qaeda in the arabian peninsula said that it had planned and funded the attack years earlier
in a video message aqap credited the american born radical preacher anwar al awlaki with giving the orders before he was killed in two thousand and eleven
separately a video emerged that appeared to show coulibaly pledging allegiance to the leader of another terror group abu bakr al baghdadi the self proclaimed caliph of the islamic state in iraq and syria
through legal papers jihadi websites press reports and its own investigations cnn has pieced together other connections
when they were in their twenty s the kouachi brothers were part of a circle of parisian islamists inspired by farid beyettoun police allege in court papers seen by cnn
later cherif kouachi was in jail with djamel beghal who was accused of being a top al qaeda recruiter
coulibaly and his wife hayat boumeddiene often visited beghal when he got out of prison as did kouachi
both kouachi brothers and coulibaly are dead but boumeddiene is on the run and investigators are continuing to look into who knows whom and what the connections could reveal

al khadr abdallah muhammad al yafi fadel hussein saleh hentif abd al rahman abdullah au shabati and mohammed ahmed salam were sent to oman
akhmed abdul qadir was transferred to estonia
it is believed to be the first time either country has accepted guantanamo bay transfers
the detainees were not released to their home country of yemen because the government there under pressure from al qaeda and houthi militants can not ensure they won't join al qaeda elements
the united states has been trying to find countries to take on the detainees who will provide security and human rights assurances for them
there are currently one hundred and twenty two prisoners left at guantanamo bay including seventy nine yemeni men according to documents from the pentagon and joint task force guantanamo
the overall number of detainees has dropped from eight hundred when the facility was first repurposed to hold captives from the united states war on terror
the transfer is part of the white house's ongoing effort to close the guantanamo bay detention center
president barack obama stated in an interview on cnn's state of the union back in december that he's going to be doing everything i can to close it

on the one hand i was so so sad to imagine the possibility of my brother being inside there she said
but on the other hand i also felt relieved that if he is inside there then there will be an opportunity for us to see him again for the last time
she and her four sisters have been waiting for news of their only brother saiful rakhmad a father of three
more than two weeks after the plane went down searchers located the majority of flight qz eight thousand five hundred and one's fuselage on wednesday indonesia's search and rescue agency said
the discovery made using a remotely operated underwater vehicle has raised the prospect that many of the bodies of the one hundred and sixty two people aboard the flight could soon be found
search teams have recovered fifty bodies from the sea in the aftermath of the crash some of them still strapped into seats
officials have said many of the more than one hundred passengers and crew members who still aren't accounted for may be inside the fuselage
divers were sent to start looking for bodies in the wreckage thursday
if the bodies are still intact they will be evacuated one by one said supriyadi an operations coordinator for indonesia's search and rescue agency who goes by only one name
but the divers work has been hampered by strong currents that have reduced visibility at the site supriyadi said according to indonesia's national news agency antara
if the divers efforts prove unsuccessful crews may lift the fuselage out of the water according to bambang soelistyo the head of the search and rescue agency
nunung said that recovering her brother's body from the wreckage would be better than not finding his body at all
after the plane went missing nunung initially went to the city of surabaya where flight qz eight thousand five hundred and one began its journey to wait for news of her brother
but she later returned to her home in pakanbaru a city one thousand five hundred kilometers away from surabaya on a different indonesian island
we the family members do not hold any religious rituals together instead we individually pray to god for his best decision for us all she said
investigators are analyzing the contents of flight qz eight thousand five hundred and one's flight recorders which were recovered from the sea earlier in the week
the two devices the flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder are likely to help them figure out what went wrong on the plane as it was flying toward singapore on december twenty eight
officials say a preliminary report should be released within a month of the crash
but it's unclear how much information the initial document will contain beyond what's already been made public
the final report containing investigators full conclusions is expected to take many more months to complete
nunung said she will nonetheless keep monitoring the situation because i want to know why the plane my brother was on crashed

it is practically an iconic photo by now a row of world leaders standing in solidarity next to one another marching in paris united against terrorism
most of them were men but some were women including angela merkel the chancellor of germany
she was right next to french president francois hollande
but ultra orthodox israeli newspaper hamevaser published a digitally altered front page image of the leaders with the women removed
ultra orthodox jews traditionally don't prefer to show images of women because it's not considered modest
as israeli newspaper haaretz noted political parties that represent the ultra orthodox sector ban women from running for office
but some feel changing the photo of the paris march went way too far
it was downright embarrassing wrote haaretz's allison kaplan sommer
the message hamevaser sent kaplan sommer said was tantamount to denying the fact that in the wider world beyond the ultra orthodox jewish community women do stand on the world stage and shape events
in addition to merkel missing from hamevaser other women leaders who disappeared from the photo are european union security and foreign affairs chief frederica mogherini and paris mayor anne hidalgo
some took to twitter to criticize the decision and to share the original and altered pictures
a satirical irish publication waterford whispers had a little fun with the story and published the photo from the paris march showing only the three women and cutting out all the men
it's not the first time an ultra orthodox publication attempted to erase a female politician
in two thousand and eleven new york based newspaper di tzeitung altered a picture to remove then secretary of state hillary clinton out of a famous shot of white house leaders watching the raid that killed osama bin laden


it was a decade ago the war on terror was in full swing iraq was on fire and every day there were images of american combat soldiers on patrols on french tv
cherif and said kouachi both in their mid twenty s were trying to find their way in the upper northwest corner of paris in the nineteen th arrondisement a poor hard knock area known for its disenfranchised and at times seething immigrant population
in their twenty s one of the brothers favorite spots was the city's fifth largest public park the buttes chaumont with open meadows ponds stunning overlooks onto the city and curiously close to the place where for centuries criminals were hanged
the brothers went to the park for sports training and exercise but it is there in the buttes chaumont where they also met with more than a dozen other similar young men who would all eventually be known to police for a terrorism plot to fight as jihadis in iraq
one of the kouachi brothers would be jailed for his involvement in that plot
but the brothers journey would go far beyond the group of men plotting in the buttes chaumont a decade ago
theirs would be a journey from youths training in a park to becoming some of the worst terrorists of the modern world
they would go from meeting disenfranchised youths to rubbing shoulders with influential international jihadi leaders
and eventually the unknown brothers actions along with their compatriots would culminate in some of the most bloody and horrific crime scenes ever known in paris plunging the city of light into darkness and despair
now they are dead killed by police in a gunfight after they attacked the offices of charlie hebdo a french magazine with a history of mocking mohammed
twelve people were killed including several top editors
the brothers said they were avenging the prophet
the kouachi brothers story has been put together from numerous sets of french court documents obtained by cnn in recent days along with interviews with numerous terrorist experts and former french government terrorism officials
the kouachi brothers of algerian descent lost their father when they were teens according to documents and interviews
their mother unable to care for them eventually sent them off to a state school for children with special needs in the countryside
she too would die before too long
their schooling would end before university and they eventually washed up in paris nineteen th arrondisement
they survived as best they could with only odd jobs
cherif the younger brother worked as a pizza deliverer according to documents
among those the brothers met were farid benyettou an influential and leading figure who mentored many of the young and disenfranchised youths at the local mosque adda'wa known as the mosque de stalingrad according to one set of documents obtained in conjunction with l'express a french news magazine
neither brother is believed to have been particularly religious
but cherif according to documents was especially drawn by benyettou first to the idea of religious zeal then to islamic radicalism and finally to the larger idea of jihad and fighting as a jihadi the documents show
many of the members of the gang would similarly credit benyettou
benyettou would serve as a common link for the gang of the buttes chaumont as the group would come to be known to police in two thousand and four and thereafter
the group worked and plotted together to send young islamic immigrants from france to iraq to fight jihad against americans there police said
three of the men in the gang had already traveled to falluja in two thousand and four when it was under the control of al qaeda in iraq's leader abu musab al zarqawi
cherif said he too wanted to travel to iraq going through syria to go and combat the americans according to documents
benyettou talked to the youths about discovering their identities and finding their roots
the roots he referred to were those of religious zealots and eventually jihadi fighters
he became for them a sort of religious leader a trainer of the quran and how it applied to being a jihadi
and benyettou talked to the young men about abuses committed by the united states in iraq most notably what happened at the abu ghraib prison
in the two thousand and seven french court documents cherif kouachi stated in a deposition i was ready to go and die in battle and i got this idea when i saw the injustices shown by television on what was going on over there
i am speaking about the torture that the americans have inflicted on the iraqis
in the documents prosecutors outlined strong details of kouachi's interest in jihad interest in martyrdom and strong links to anti semitism attacking and killing jews
kouachi said he came to the idea of jihad through benyettou
kouachi said he likely would not have pursued the idea had it not been for benyettou
through benyettou kouachi was studying how to wield arms and use kalashnikovs
under a section titled motivations of influence describing kouachi court records said he stated the wise leaders in islam told him and his friends that if they die as martyrs in jihad they would go to heaven
benyettou told them that martyrs would be greeted by more than sixty virgins in a big palace in heaven
the documents also said kouachi had come to feel that any place on earth where there is such an injustice is justification for jihad
what was going on in iraq was in his eyes such an injustice
kouachi said he didn't consider himself a good enough muslim and said he had only been to the mosque two or three times before he met benyettou and he had been smoking cannabis
kouachi told investigators he committed himself to the idea of jihad during ramadan in two thousand and four
he told his friends he was going to syria to fight
when police interviewed his accomplices they stated that kouachi said he was ready to firebomb and to destroy jewish shops in paris
but when officials confronted kouachi with that information he told them that's not exactly what i said

i don't hide having proposed anti semitic ideas but i would note that i never really would have done that
kouachi however never made it to iraq
he was detained along with six others including benyettou in two thousand and five
they were charged with conspiring to commit acts of terrorism
kouachi told the court he was relieved he was detained
french journalist magali serre interviewed kouachi's social worker who said kouachi said he was finished with so called jihad documents show
but in prison the real radicalization began for cherif kouachi and it would ultimately lead him and his older brother said to terrible acts
cherif kouachi was in prison with other hard liners including a central figure in the al qaeda networks in europe said jean charles brisard the head of the french center for the analysis of terrorism
the central figure in prison was djamel beghal also of algerian origin who was jailed for plotting to attack the u.s. embassy in paris in two thousand and one
in prison beghal became the mentor the spiritual mentor and continued the work in some way initiated by benyettou said brisard
beghal would prove to be pivotal to the evolution and radicalization of the brothers and their friends
it was only the latest step in beghal's long history of mentoring future terrorists
once known as al qaeda's premiere european recruiter beghal was convicted himself of conspiring to attack the u.s. embassy in paris
beghal was in direct contact with the highest ranking members of al qaeda at the time said brisard
beghal's ties to al qaeda stretch back before the nine eleven attacks in the united states against the world trade center and the pentagon sources told cnn
he was put in charge of the plot to blow up the u.s. embassy in paris according to court documents
he was ultimately convicted in a french court
beghal's mentor was finsbury park mosque cleric abu hamza al masri who was only last week convicted on terrorism charges by a federal judge in new york
he was sentenced to life in prison
al masri is believed to have radicalized and influenced convicted terrorists shoe bomber richard reid and nine eleven's zacarias moussaoui
documents show beghal later came to be referred to as abu hamza out of respect for beghal's mentor
cherif and beghal grew close during cherif's time in prison from two thousand and five through two thousand and eight and it is believed the far more radical and jihadi focused beghal had a significant affect
another disaffected young and angry muslim also in prison was amedy coulibaly the third attacker in paris last week who is accused of killing a french police officer and killing four more people at a kosher grocery store
coulibaly and cherif kouachi met in prison where coulibaly was serving a sentence for armed robbery according to court documents
the radical jihadi leader beghal became a tie between kouachi and coulibaly
beghal got out of jail in mid two thousand and nine and from that point on kouachi and coulibaly went to visit beghal at his place at murat in cantal
they would bring beghal food and money
also part of the visits was coulibaly's partner hayat boumeddiene who is on the run and wanted by police as a suspect in the kosher grocery store incident
authorities say beghal kouachi and coulibaly in two thousand and ten plotted to break out another imprisoned algerian terrorist smain ait ali belkacem
belkacem had been imprisoned for one thousand nine hundred and ninety five bombings in the paris metro system
court documents detail how kouachi and coulibaly worked with beghal hiding their conversations by using code names over disposable cell phones
in april two thousand and ten both kouachi and coulibaly were even staying with beghal sometimes for days
sometimes hayat boumeddiene joined the visits
coulibaly is described in the documents as the logistics expert who was in charge of gathering the weapons and arms in the plot to spring belkacem
there were elaborate details sophisticated computers encryption details of one way tickets and handwritten notes in arabic that when translated turned out to be recipes for poison
in may two thousand and ten in the department of seine saint denis coulibaly was found to have illegally stored a huge cache of high caliber arms including some two hundred and forty cartridges for high powered machine guns with the specific goal of seriously hurting people through intimidation or terror acts in violation of numerous national security laws
kouachi coulibaly and beghal eventually would be arrested for the plot
but while coulibaly went to jail kouachi did not because there was not enough evidence
coulibaly was released early sometime in two thousand and fourteen
beghal was sentenced to twelve years in prison and remains behind bars

al qaeda in the arabian peninsula commander nasr ibn ali al ansi's twelve minute message declares brothers said and cherif kouachi to be in the group's eyes heroes who were assigned and accepted and fulfilled a task
it claims that much of what remains of al qaeda's command was somehow involved in choosing the charlie hebdo magazine as a target
several times it evokes the name of osama bin laden and his successor ayman al zawahiri names that in the current focus on isis rampage across the middle east seem almost to hail from a time of jihad past
a vital part of the claim is its insistence that amedy coulibaly the gunman who attacked the kosher grocery store was not part of their operation but his attack coincided with theirs as good fortune
coulibaly left a long video in which he pledged bayat or allegiance to abu bakr al baghdadi the head of isis
this hints at the growing and deeply troubling rivalry of sorts between isis and the older brand of jihad al qaeda
while it seems at first bizarre that two groups with fundamentally similar goals would conflict the differing worlds of al qaeda and isis have been apparent for some time now
al qaeda's franchise in syria al nusra front is hit by u.s. airstrikes along with isis and both are described as terror groups by the u.s. government but the al qaeda affiliate does at times clash with isis for territory and resources
last spring al qaeda's leader al zawahiri distanced himself from the newer more savage hotheads of isis a move that guaranteed for now their paths would continue to diverge
al qaeda in the arabian peninsula's message wednesday doesn't spell out how to connect the dots concretely between the kouachi brothers disturbed cries they were working for al qaeda in yemen and the yemeni jihadis themselves that's something investigators have to work on to prove
are there real and genuine logistical links between that paris street and the radical cells training in the desert 
but it does make some intriguing claims that are partially backed up by suggestions from some officials
the al qaeda in the arabian peninsula statement claims that the late anwar al awlaki was somehow involved operationally in the plan to target charlie hebdo
that is a hugely potent statement
al awlaki a recruiter and radical preacher for al qaeda and an american citizen of yemeni heritage has long been dead killed by an american drone strike in two thousand and eleven
said and or cherif kouachi were in yemen in two thousand and eleven according to witnesses and officials although investigators are still working out their exact movements with said possibly there as early as two thousand and nine when it is alleged he roomed briefly with umar farouk abdulmutallab the underwear bomber who targeted a plane to detroit in two thousand and nine
were al awlaki the organizer of the attack someone who laid on the logistical support financing or chose the target as the al qaeda in the arabian peninsula statement suggests then the kouachi brothers would have been dormant for three years before launching their attack on january seven
investigators will be desperate to know if there was any further contact between two thousand and eleven and the paris attacks whether the orders and logistics were in place by two thousand and eleven or further assistance or instructions came closer to the moment
were it the former this would be a truly chilling sleeper cell idle for years and then at a moment's notice deadly
above all wednesday's long and florid statement shows an al qaeda desperate not to be eclipsed by its newer and at times in the gruesome jousting of this world more radical cousin isis
the names and faces of their leaders alive and dead live on particularly that of al awlaki who it is said threatens the west both in his life and after his martyrdom
it's a chilling sign al qaeda may very much be a current and real danger


if they're not tossed from a train or left in a desert they may be cheated or worse
people would tell me
well we've kind of accepted or we're used to being robbed and beaten and raped photographer michelle frankfurter said
they're willing to risk all that she said
it sheds some light on just how bad things are in honduras el salvador and guatemala
between two thousand and nine and two thousand and fourteen frankfurter took several trips to mexico to document migrants journey from the country's southern border to its northern one
she was inspired by enrique's journey a book by pulitzer prize winning journalist sonia nazario which tells the story of a honduran boy risking it all to reunite with his mother in the united states
i watched these people leave everything behind leave with nothing but a little backpack with a few belongings and then this faith that they have frankfurter said
there's a lot of sadness and deprivation but there's a lot of beauty in it as well she said
she described her favorite photograph from the series
taken inside a makeshift chapel it shows a crucifix a wounded man and several migrants resting on the floor alongside dogs
i've been to that particular place a number of times and i never ever saw that kind of confluence of elements together in one single image like that she said
everything to me is in that one photograph
frankfurter found people to follow at shelters
she'd spend a couple days with a group before venturing out to the rail yard and hopping a train
rather than see the current rush of migrants as something like the break of a dam frankfurter has watched the pressure build for decades as civil wars trade policies and a booming drug trade combine to squeeze people from all sides
she lived in nicaragua in the late one thousand nine hundred and ninety s
i kept thinking that i would see that wave taper off
and instead there was just this dramatic spike frankfurter said
it seems like a story that just keeps mutating in a way but just keeps on going and that there is no real end to it

yet this outpouring of solidarity must not obscure another response across the continent
leaders of europe's far right have been quick to blame islam and immigration mosques have been defaced in france and elsewhere and a xenophobic movement called patriotic europeans against the islamization of the occident brought tens of thousands to the streets of germany this week
this extreme strand of european publics and politics will likely receive a boost from the french tragedy
anti immigration and anti islamic sentiments have been on a steady rise in europe for years
while a majority of europeans appreciates mobility and migration within the european union they are largely negative about immigration from outside of the eu according to the latest eurobarometer survey
this opposition is particularly pronounced towards muslim immigrants
half and more of all europeans view islam as incompatible with the western world while islam is seen as an outright threat by between one third of all brits and almost two thirds of all spaniards according to a recent bertelsmann study
holders of such views will surely see the paris attacks as confirmation
many others may now question their hitherto more moderate opinions
it is these sentiments along with fears over economic prospects aversion to the political establishment and doubts in the european project that populist and typically far right parties have successfully tapped in recent years
virtually every eu country has seen the rise of such a political force and their combined representation in the european parliament has shot up to twenty percents in last year's elections
for these parties the paris attacks truly are a told you so moment
nigel farage of the united kingdom independence party blamed a fifth column within our countries while geert wilders of the freedom party in the netherlands claimed that it was time to de islamize our country
marine le pen of the french front national urged that time's up for denial and hypocrisy and alexander gauland of the alternative for germany saw all those proven wrong who had ignored the islamist threat
sadly these slogans are more likely than ever before now to resonate with european publics
this combination of a considerable portion of europeans that are skeptical of if not outright hostile to muslims and migrants and the ever more aggressive rhetoric of the populist far right puts a massive pressure on europe's politics and societies alike
first and foremost europe's muslim communities are likely to suffer
although in their overwhelming majority they are integrated and identify with europe blanket suspicion against islam resentments in day to day life and assaults on their community are bound to increase and deepen fear and alienation among muslims
this will feed segregation among muslim and non muslim communities and provide a fertile ground for the radicalization of some young muslims
in short european muslims are at risk of being driven away from mainstream european societies
secondly the political climate and culture in europe will change
under attack from extremists whether in parliament or in the streets mainstream political parties will be tempted to move away from their typically centered whether somewhat to the left or right positions
politics will move to tighten immigration laws select highly skilled migrants over refugees from war zones push for their greater assimilation and install additional security measures
as a result further liberties of european citizens are likely to be sacrificed as political establishments try to preempt a further growth of extremist parties
this is a slippery slope as radicals will quickly produce the next phobia that they demand to be addressed
thirdly this changing climate and politics will also impact on migration and migrants broadly beyond muslims
already there have been fierce debates to limit intra european migration whether hurdles to central and eastern europeans after their countries joined the european union or restrictions on social benefits eu citizens can draw across borders
much as these debates are already taking their toll on some of europe's poorest such as the roma future approaches to immigration to the eu will likely exclude some of the world's most underprivileged such as asylum seekers
fortress europe will become even more of a reality
europe can still stem this dangerous trend
millions of french people of all origins and faiths have given a powerful example of unity openness and inclusiveness last week as have tens of thousands of pro tolerance and pro immigration marchers in germany this week
it is now also on europe's political class to resolutely refute the many told you so's on the continent

attack will empower europe's far right

the developments came as deputy prime minister yalcin akdogan wrote on twitter those who are publishing figures referring to our supreme prophet are those who disregard the sacred
such a move is open incitement and provocation he added
turkey is home to eighty two million people ninety nine point eight percents of whom are muslim according to the cia world factbook
the french satirical publication charlie hebdo's new cover contains what it calls a caricature of the prophet mohammed holding a sign saying je suis charlie
the caption says all is forgiven in french
it comes a week after islamist terrorists killed twelve people at the paper's offices
police went to the offices of istanbul newspaper cumhuriyet and blocked off traffic around it after the paper published excerpts from the charlie hebdo issue
armored police blocked the entrance and stopped distribution trucks at the printing press in istanbul the secular daily said
the prosecutor's office then stopped the blockade possibly because it did not know the image was inside the paper according to the report
cumhuriyet included a four page sample of charlie hebdo's latest edition translated into turkish
that sample which the prosecutor's office saw did not include the cover the paper said
but inside the paper two columnists had included small images of the cover with their columns the paper reported
an editorial in the newspaper said the drawing on the charlie hebdo cover did not seem to have anything to do with prophet mohammed
that drawing is a symbol of a humane and conscientious attitude and it says all is forgiven 
cumhuriyet editor in chief utku cakirozer explained on twitter and on the newspaper's website that cumhuriyet has lost writers to terror attacks and understands the charlie hebdo massacre very well
three protesters were arrested in front of cumhuriyet's offices cnn turk reported

the rise of islamic state in iraq and syria the islamist militant group that has seized a chunk of land stretching from northern syria to central iraq has struck fear into the hearts of leaders around the world
cnn explains isis roots what it controls and where its support comes from
the group began in two thousand and four as al qaeda in iraq before rebranding as isis two years later
it was an ally of and had similarities with osama bin laden's al qaeda
both were radical anti western militant groups devoted to establishing an independent islamic state in the region
but isis unlike al qaeda which disowned the group in early two thousand and fourteen has proven to be more brutal and more effective at controlling territory it has seized
isis is putting governing structures in place to rule the territories the group conquers once the dust settles on the battlefield
from the cabinet and the governors to the financial and legislative bodies isis bureaucratic hierarchy looks a lot like those of some of the western countries whose values it rejects if you take away the democracy and add in a council to consider who should be beheaded
the group seized control of mosul iraq's second largest city this summer
but its power base is in raqqa eastern syria where isis is now in control of more than half of syria's oil assets along with a number of oil fields in iraq according to energy expert luay al khateeb
al khateeb says the oil is finding its way to the black market and could be making isis up to three million dollar each day
more than eleven thousand people have traveled from abroad to fight in syria and iraq officials suggest although some have gone back home again
they align themselves with different factions and sometimes change loyalties as groups merge disband or change allegiances
naturally countries with bigger muslim populations tend to send the largest number of fighters
but some nations with relatively small muslim populations have sent a disproportionately large number of jihadis
finland ireland and australia have the highest number of foreign fighters per capita although finnish security officials say a minority of finns in their count went for humanitarian reasons

one man dominated the headlines peddling optimism
india's new prime minister narendra modi
modi has fashioned a role for himself not only as ceo of india inc. but also as its global ambassador with blockbuster speeches promoting india in new york tokyo and sydney
he is also india's brand manager launching catchy campaigns such as make in india mycleanindia and digital india
modi has won a broad mandate as evidenced by his party's performance in tricky state elections in december
and yet two thousand and fifteen marks the end of modi's honeymoon
after all hope can only go so far
modi's greatest accomplishment in two thousand and fourteen was to offer promise
he energized weary indians
he convinced the world that india had a giant open sign on its front doorstep almost literally with visas on arrival
he spent much of the year in campaign mode in india and abroad
but in two thousand and fifteen modi will need to transition from speechmaker to doer or else risk disenchanting another generation
that suggests two thousand and fifteen will be a defining year for india
let's start with economics
india was blessed with favorable tail winds last year
at the start of modi's term brent crude was trading at about one hundred and ten dollar a barrel
by year end prices had halved
cheaper oil was a boon to india's economy
the deficit shrank inflation fell and perhaps most crucially the government took the opportunity to end decades of subsidies and deregulated diesel
new taxes on oil look set to generate billions of dollars in excess revenue every year
india's government will look to use that money well
can it deliver on its promises of clean water and power to one point two five billion indians 
can it really improve india's broken infrastructure ports roads trains and bridges some of which never seem to connect 
can it begin to fulfill its promise to put a toilet in every home 
or has too much been promised 
in any case india needs much more money and investment likely from abroad
and modi will need another important currency
cooperation from his lawmakers
india needs to rid itself of arcane laws on retrospective taxation
it will look to unite its states under a common tax system to foster free trade and business
but these acts will take political will and wile
can modi legislate as well as he can campaign 
can he really as his government has promised improve india's ranking for doing business from a dismal one hundred and forty two nd in the world to somewhere in the top fifty 
these are all questions that modi will need to answer in two thousand and fifteen
foreign policy has come easily to modi so far
he will begin two thousand and fifteen basking in the glow of receiving president barack obama the chief guest at india's republic day on january twenty six
obama will be the first sitting american president to visit india more than once
for modi however good foreign policy means good business
he will look to strike deals not only with obama but with many other world leaders in two thousand and fifteen on energy trade defense and infrastructure partnerships
all that sounds right up modi's alley
the great unknown is how he will respond to a major foreign policy crisis the likes of which he largely escaped in two thousand and fourteen
how will he react to a major skirmish with pakistan 
how will he balance his desire to boost chinese trade with fears about beijing's growing assertiveness in the region 
and what will he do if in a big global crisis he is pushed to choose sides between any of russia china and the united states 
can india remain everyone's friend 
will modi develop a values based vision of india's place in the world 
on domestic issues a year ago modi was known outside india mostly for his inability or worse apathy in stopping one of the worst religious riots in modern indian history when some two thousand muslims were killed in gujarat the state he ran at the time
modi's perceived role led to his u.s. visa being revoked
a year on new york city received modi as if he were a rock star
in the space of a year modi has managed to transform his image abroad from pariah to visionary leader
recent events are cause for renewed worry
reports of hindu groups forcing christians and muslims to convert to hinduism threaten the very basis of the indian secular state
minorities simply can not live in fear
in two thousand and fifteen modi will need not only to be a voice of reason but he will also have to rein in radical fringe elements of his hindu support base
the safety of women will remain a major issue of concern at home and abroad
at his two thousand and fourteen independence day speech modi remarked how the indian people's heads hang in shame with each report of rape
the sad reality is that modi will probably make the same comment at this year's speech
as i've written previously india has let its women down for centuries
they rank one hundred and thirty four th in the world for economic opportunities one hundred and twenty six th for education and one hundred and forty one st for health
how can that be good enough for a country that aspires to be a major world power 
beyond politics from living and reporting in india i am hopeful about this country's future
my optimism is based less on politics or economics and more on a larger trend
the country's technology boom
while the west has evolved in its internet use from dial up to cable to mobile four g india's journey has been different
it has jumped straight to a mobile revolution
most indians who discover the internet will discover it on a cheap smartphone not a pc
the pace of technology adoption coupled with faster and cheaper hardware will transform india in ways we are only just beginning to comprehend
so expect india to start leapfrogging many of the problems the west has spent decades dealing with
india has never had a real database of its citizens but soon it will be the first country to have an entirely digital biometric id system
there will be real changes in people's lives and their economies with the help of e commerce and apps for health education banking and transport
beyond oil politics or demographics the biggest tail wind for india lies in its adoption of technology
this will be india's real revolution and it is already underway

here's what we know about the islamist extremist group
aqap has its home in yemen an impoverished and troubled nation that borders saudi arabia and oman and eyes strife torn somalia across the gulf of aden
in recent months the sunni extremist group has come under pressure within yemen from shiite houthi rebels and government forces
but the paris attack shows the group's apparent continued ability to direct operations beyond yemen's borders
its influence on would be jihadis is also widereaching thanks to its slick english language online magazine inspire first published in two thousand and ten
as military operations in afghanistan and pakistan have squeezed the central leadership of al qaeda its affiliates have stepped forward as the main perpetrators of terror attacks though recently challenged for the spotlight by isis
aqap chief nasir al wuhayshi is al qaeda's no
two and has so far remained loyal to the terror network's leader ayman al zawahiri
he was designated as al zawahiri's global deputy in two thousand and thirteen
aqap late last year issued a rebuke to isis already cut off by al qaeda's general command in february reflecting a certain rivalry between al qaeda and isis as the latter seeks to extend its reach beyond iraq and syria
some analysts say that rivalry could prompt each terror group to escalate
the tension and the competition between al qaeda and isis is tremendous says matthew levitt at the washington institute for near east policy
they're in competition for money
they're in competition for recruits
they're in competition for the attention of the media
he said aqap had recently been eclipsed in the race for global impact
they hadn't carried out anything spectacular in quite some time and were becoming second fiddle to their jihadi competitors in isis he said
meanwhile isis has tremendous things to point to for their success
the holding of territory
they've established a caliphate
the vast majority of foreign fighters who are traveling from around the world are flocking not to al qaeda but to isis
al qaeda in the arabian peninsula first emerged in saudi arabia in two thousand and two but thanks to the efforts of the saudi authorities was a mostly spent force by two thousand and five according to analysis from jane's world insurgency and terrorism
it re emerged reinvigorated in yemen in two thousand and nine after the saudi outfit merged with a yemeni al qaeda counterpart the analysis said
in a video statement released a week after the bloody shooting at the magazine's paris offices aqap commander nasr ibn ali al ansi claimed full responsibility for the attack
we clarify to the islamic world that the one who chose the target laid the plan financed the operation and appointed its emir is the leadership of the organization he said
al ansi described the kouachi brothers as heroes saying they not only accepted their terror assignment but promised and fulfilled
he said the arrangements for the operation had been made by the group's late leader radical american cleric anwar al awlaki who threatens the west both in his life and after his martyrdom
the attack was revenge for the magazine's depictions of the prophet mohammed he said
al ansi blamed not only charlie hebdo but also france and the united states in his statement
u.s. national security council spokesman alistair baskey said the intelligence community was working to determine the video's authenticity
there have been conflicting accounts as to which of the brothers went to yemen or whether indeed it was both and how many times
but a senior yemeni security source told cnn the yemenis believe both were in yemen for about three months starting in april two thousand and eleven
it is unclear how much of the time the brothers spent together
the official added the yemenis do not believe cherif attended language schools in sanaa as his brother had earlier
it is thought likely that one or both of the brothers received weapons training from aqap while in yemen and that one may have met with al awlaki
a yemeni journalist and researcher mohammed al kibsi told cnn he had twice met and spoken with said kouachi in the capital sanaa and that kouachi had briefly roomed there with the failed underwear bomber umar farouk abdulmutallab
investigators believe cherif kouachi was in yemen in two thousand and eleven and that when he left he was carrying money from aqap earmarked to carry out attacks a u.s. official told cnn
the investigators believe aqap could have provided as much as twenty thousand dollar but the united states hasn't verified the exact amount
u.s. officials consider aqap the most dangerous branch of al qaeda according to cnn terrorism analyst paul cruickshank
in november aqap released a statement calling on muslims around the world to forget their differences and renew their efforts to carry out operations against american targets whether civilian military or diplomatic
the u.s. state department's rewards for justice program has posted a reward of up to ten million dollar for information that brings al wuhayshi to justice saying he has provided significant support for aqap terrorist operations
he has been a specially designated global terrorist since two thousand and ten
and while al awlaki was killed in a u.s. drone strike in yemen in two thousand and eleven the radical cleric's influence lives on and with it a threat to the united states says cnn national security analyst peter bergen
al awlaki was an influence on tamerlan and dzhokhar tsarnaev who are alleged to have killed three people in the boston marathon bombings in two thousand and thirteen bergen said
he also influenced carlos bledsoe who shot up an army recruiting center in little rock arkansas killing an american soldier in two thousand and nine
after the attacks bledsoe said his spiritual inspiration was al awlaki
maj. nidal hasan killed thirteen people at fort hood texas in two thousand and nine after sending eighteen emails to al awlaki in yemen a correspondence that was known to the fbi
al awlaki did not direct this attack but he was the key inspiration for hasan
abdulmutallab's botched attempt to bring down an american jet over detroit in the fall of two thousand and nine also was directed by al awlaki bergen said
a video released by aqap's official media arm in december showed a short clip of abdulmutallab together with both al wuhayshi and al awlaki
aqap set out its objectives in a may two thousand and ten statement as the expulsion of jews and crusaders from the arabian peninsula the re establishment of the islamic caliphate the introduction of sharia or islamic law and the liberation of muslim lands according to analysis from jane's world insurgency and terrorism
this suggests the group aims to rid yemen and saudi arabia of non muslims and overthrow the nations governments to be replaced with what it considers to be an islamic state
to that end it has targeted foreigners and government forces in yemen as well as saudi leaders
in two thousand and nine prince mohammed bin naif bin abdulaziz the saudi arabian deputy minister of interior survived a bomb attack carried out by an aqap militant
through its inspire magazine the group also hopes to radicalize western muslims and stoke grass roots jihadist action in western nations the jane's report says
the group's current incarnation is widely considered to be the al qaeda regional franchise that represents the most serious international threat it concludes


a possible ammonia leak in the cooling system had the crew from the american segment of the station move temporarily to the russian segment
it was a false alarm nasa said
tests indicated that the off scale measurements were the result of a computer failure and not an ammonia leak
international space station program manager mike suffredini said the relocation was done as a precaution because of four measurements that were off scale
these measures could have indicated an ammonia leak
the astronauts as trained put on masks moved to the russian segment and closed the hatch to the american segment he said
two u.s. astronauts are aboard the international space station
commander barry wilmore and flight engineer terry virts
once it was determined that the emergency was a false alarm the astronauts still had to wait while equipment on the u.s. segment was powered back up suffredini said
nasa tweeted that at three five p.m
et the hatch was reopened and the astronauts returned
there was no ammonia in the area nasa said
the crew was unable to carry out experiments that were planned but no research was lost suffredini said
the americans were joined by samantha cristoforetti a flight engineer with the european space agency and others in the space station's six member crew
hey everybody thanks for your concern cristoforetti tweeted
we're all safe and doing well in the russian segment

the new ban in urumqi was approved by local legislators last month and given the greenlight by the regional legislature at the weekend
the ordinance name suggests it targets outer garments covering someone's full body including the face which is called a burqa in some islamic traditions
a spate of recent violent incidents has rocked xinjiang a resource rich region long inhabited by the turkic speaking largely muslim uyghurs
the arrival of waves of han chinese the country's predominant ethnic group over the past decades has fueled ethnic tensions
chinese officials have blamed the recent attacks on uyghur separatists whom they also label religious extremists seeking to establish an independent state
last august another city in xinjiang banned people wearing islamic style clothing and large beards from riding public buses during a provincial sporting event according to state media
news reports at the time said karamay city authorities targeted veils large beards as well as three types of islamic dresses including those with the star and crescent symbol
dozens of bus stations in the city were said to be manned by security personnel to conduct checks and report violators to the police
while the measures in karamay didn't openly single out uyghurs exiled uyghur rights groups have condemned them calling the ban a green light for racism and discrimination
those restrictions came shortly after after authorities in xinjiang banned students and civil servants from fasting during ramadan the muslim holy month
amnesty international has said uyghurs face widespread discrimination in employment housing and educational opportunities as well as curtailed religious freedom and political marginalization
other critics including exiled uyghur activists have attributed the rise of violence in xinjiang to beijing's increasingly repressive rule there a claim the government vehemently denies

the newborn babies many suffering from hiv aids and malnutrition were sold for between fifty thousand yuan to eighty thousand yuan
the boys fetched higher prices than girls according to the online video report published on tuesday
babies were often transported in large handbags and suitcases to prospective buyers
and they were allegedly fed instant noodles and leftover vegetables according to chinese state media
authorities have arrested one hundred and three people suspected of trafficking or purchasing the infants
police spotted a suspicious group of pregnant women being ushered into an abandoned factory in the city of jining last july where they found baby diapers and other evidence of it being used as an underground delivery room
we noticed there has been some new developments in the methods for child trafficking related crimes chen shiqu director of the ministry of public security's anti trafficking office told cctv
for example some criminal gangs would send pregnant women who are about to give birth via public transport to another city
the babies are then sold after the women give birth says chen
an investigator who was on the case said they detained seven suspects and found one baby nearly smothered under blankets in the run down factory with squalid living conditions
at that time the baby's face was already turning purple if we didn't search through those blankets that baby may have already died said liu yang a police investigator
in a two month sting operation following the raid police discovered that the babies were often transported from the factory in bags to a hospital for infectious diseases in a nearby suburb where they were kept awaiting buyers
out of the thirty seven babies we rescued almost none of them were healthy
all had varying levels of some sickness
they let the babies eat instant noodles said hou jun a local police officer
one of the buyers liu zhiyou said an agent told him it was an illegitimate child from a student
some of the babies have remained with their adoptive parents while others are in orphanages
the three year old was reunited with her mother according to chinese media
according to chinese law child traffickers can be imprisoned up to ten years for selling more than three children or sentenced to death in more serious cases
child trafficking has become a major concern in china as traffickers seek to profit off a growing demand for healthy babies from potential adoptive parents both in china and beyond
in march last year chinese officials uncovered four child trafficking rings and arrested more than a thousand people for using websites and instant messaging groups to sell babies
a chinese obstetrician was also convicted for selling babies after telling their parents they were sick in early two thousand and fourteen

the confirmation follows major developments in the investigation of the disaster the recoveries earlier this week of the plane's flight data and cockpit voice recorders
searchers saw the plane's main body with one of its wings attached via a camera carried by a remotely operated underwater vehicle indonesia search chief bambang soelistyo said
key in identifying the debris are the words painted on the section
pictures released by the search agency appear to show portions of the words now and everyone
airasia says the slogan now everyone can fly had been on the length of the plane which crashed december twenty eight as it flew toward singapore from the indonesian city of surabaya
divers will search the fuselage for bodies thursday and if the divers encounter trouble crews may lift the fuselage out of the water soelistyo said
officials didn't mention the depth of the water
but officials have said other debris such as the recorders which were found about a half mile from the fuselage on monday and tuesday were discovered at a depth of roughly thirty meters
at least fifty bodies have been recovered from the sea soelistyo said
some were strapped into seats
officials have said that many of the more than one hundred remaining bodies might be found in or near the plane's fuselage
the majority of the people on flight qz eight thousand five hundred and one were indonesian
citizens of britain france malaysia singapore and south korea also were aboard
soelistyo said the discovered portion of the fuselage is about one hundred feet long
that would represent the majority of the airbus a three hundred and twenty two hundred which was about one hundred and twenty feet long
authorities don't know why the plane crashed
roughly thirty five minutes into the flight the pilot asked air traffic control for permission to turn left and climb to avoid bad weather
minutes later the plane disappeared from radar
on tuesday divers retrieved the cockpit voice recorder which is designed to retain all sounds on a plane's flight deck
a day earlier searchers recovered the plane's other key information source the flight data recorder which stores a vast amount of information about the aircraft's performance including air speed and cabin pressure
both devices are expected to help investigators understand what went wrong
the flight data recorder tells investigators what happened on a plane but the cockpit voice recorder tells them why said mardjono siswosuwarno a senior official at indonesia's national transportation safety committee which is leading the investigation into the disaster
the why is mostly in there he said of the voice recorder which captures conversations between pilots as well as other sounds in the cockpit
the two flight recorders were taken to a lab in jakarta the indonesian capital for analysis
investigators say they have successfully downloaded the contents of both devices
but mardjono cautioned that interpreting the information requires much more time
after the download investigators should have a pretty good idea within a couple of days of what happened aboard the plane mary schiavo a former inspector general of the u.s. department of transportation said this week
the flight data recorder usually contains hundreds of parameters and thousands of data points she said that look a bit like an electrocardiogram when they're printed
mardjono said he expected a preliminary report to be released within a month of the crash
but it's unclear how much information the initial document will contain beyond what's already been made public
the final report containing investigators full conclusions will take months mardjono said
the agency's final report into adam air flight five hundred and seventy four which crashed in indonesian waters on new year's day two thousand and seven killing all one hundred and two people on board came out more than a year after that disaster
mardjono said the airasia plane's flight data recorder was in good condition after being pulled out of the water from under the debris of a wing monday
the recovery of the recorders took place after the plane's tail was lifted from the waves saturday
observers have suggested that the locations of the different parts of debris indicate the plane broke apart when it hit the water not when it was still at a high altitude
one indonesian search official who goes by the single name of supriyadi said that the debris patterns suggest the aircraft exploded on impact
but the country's transportation investigators said it was premature to say what had happened and one expert questioned the search official's choice of words
the word exploded i think maybe loses a little bit in translation said david soucie a former federal aviation administration safety inspector
i think really what he's meaning is a rupture from the impact itself
as with any hollow object hitting something very hard the pressure differential between the outside and the inside is very significant and it'll actually tear apart the aircraft on the top soucie said
that may be what he's referring to

that picture looks much more complex one week later
two more attacks against a police officer and another that included hostages at a kosher supermarket brought the final death toll to seventeen plus three suspects killed
the threads that investigators have followed from the newsroom of the satirical magazine and the paris supermarket have led to other countries including yemen turkey syria and bulgaria
the untangling of who was behind the attacks has also revealed other suspects and there have been claims of links to the biggest terrorist groups al qaeda and isis which now calls itself the islamic state
here is a look at the key people places and questions that have surfaced as investigators probe more deeply
besides said and cherif kouachi the brothers identified as the shooters at charlie hebdo who were later killed by police another man amedy coulibaly has been linked to the attacks
police killed him last week after he took hostages at the paris kosher grocery store
there is one named suspect at large
hayat boumeddiene coulibaly's widow
but there are other suspects
french citizen fritz joly joachin was arrested in bulgaria at the border with turkey on an unrelated charge but he faces terrorism charges in connection with the kouachis
and french security services have identified a suspected accomplice in the kosher grocery attack according to the french newspaper le parisien
police sources cited by the newspaper said one line of investigation is that the accomplice a man from a paris suburb may have driven coulibaly to the market where coulibaly later shot dead four people
we are doing everything we can to dismantle what appears to be a network

no doubt there was complicity and networks and maybe finance also valls told cnn's christiane amanpour
given the magnitude of the operations and the apparent sophistication of the gunmen many wonder who if anyone trained or possibly gave orders to the attackers
al qaeda in the arabian peninsula or aqap has claimed credit for the magazine attack
when the heroes were assigned they accepted
they promised and fulfilled aqap commander nasr ibn ali al ansi said in a video message referring to the kouachi brothers and the slayings at charlie hebdo
the late u.s. born muslim cleric anwar al awlaki is the one who masterminded that operation before his two thousand and eleven death aqap said
past statements by the three main suspects claim allegiance to al qaeda or isis an unsatisfying answer because the two terror groups are considered rivals
both jihadist groups have an islamist worldview however and it is possible that even if the suspects plotted together they may have been inspired by different groups
cherif and said kouachi are both said to have traveled to yemen
cherif before he was killed by police told cnn affiliate bfmtv that he'd trained in yemen with aqap
cherif kouachi used his brother's passport to travel to yemen in two thousand and eleven two western intelligence sources with knowledge of the matter told cnn adding that it was likely he had trained with aqap there
a senior yemeni national security official told cnn that said had also entered yemen multiple times
coulibaly also called bfmtv before he was killed
he purportedly said by phone that he belonged to isis
that information hasn't been corroborated by authorities and it's not known whether he knew any leaders or members of that terrorist group
in the aftermath of the paris attacks his widow boumeddiene is believed to have fled to syria where isis operates
gunman tried to justify market raid to hostages recording apparently shows
terrorism experts say isis and al qaeda have an adversarial relationship so how are the self proclaimed al qaeda followers said and cherif kouachi linked to the self proclaimed isis member coulibaly 
said kouachi's wife told investigators that her husband and coulibaly knew each other well
french court documents show that coulibaly and cherif kouachi were also close associates and plotted to stage a prison break to free a fellow terrorist in two thousand and ten
kouachi and coulibaly had a mentor in common a radical named djamel beghal
once known as al qaeda's premiere european recruiter beghal was convicted of conspiring to attack the u.s. embassy in paris
the attack was years in the making aqap claims and was conceived as revenge for charlie hebdo's depictions of the prophet mohammed
al ansi blamed not only the satirical magazine but also france and the united states in his statement
it is france that has shared all of america's crimes al ansi added
it is france that has committed crimes in mali and the islamic maghreb
it is france that supports the annihilation of muslims in central africa in the name of race cleansing
u.s. officials told cnn it's believed that when cherif kouachi traveled to yemen in two thousand and eleven he returned carrying money from aqap earmarked to carry out the attack
investigators said the terrorist group could have given as much as twenty thousand dollar but the exact amount has not been verified
it is notable that aqap did not claim responsibility for the siege at the paris kosher grocery store where four hostages were killed along with gunman coulibaly
aqap praised the attack at the kosher grocery store calling it a blessing from allah that happened at the same time as the attack on charlie hebdo's office
boumeddiene's name came to light in the paris attacks shortly after the kouachi brothers were identified
she was named a suspect together with her husband coulibaly
there were initial reports that she had fled after the kosher market attack but this was not confirmed and new evidence suggests that she was not in france at all during the attacks
but she could be a key to unraveling the details behind the attacks
authorities are looking into whether boumeddiene helped prepare the attacks before leaving france
boumeddiene arrived in turkey from madrid on january two five days before the first attack in paris turkey's anadolu news agency reports
boumeddiene stayed at an istanbul hotel and then traveled to syria on thursday andalou said
the last place authorities spotted boumeddiene was somewhere near turkey's border with syria
a surveillance video image shows her at an istanbul airport with a man beside her
on tuesday france's le monde newspaper identified the man as mehdi belhoucine describing him as someone known to french intelligence and who could have ties to a separate jihadist cell
belhoucine's brother the newspaper said was imprisoned last year for helping send fighters to afghanistan and pakistan
he was arrested near the border with turkey for allegedly kidnapping his son bulgarian foreign ministry spokeswoman betina joteva said
the ministry said that joachin will remain in custody until at least january twenty when a court will consider second warrant related to terrorism charges
a bulgarian prosecutor said the terrorism charge is regarding joachin's contacts with the kouachi brothers afp reported
the charges are for participation in an organized crime group whose aim was
terrorist acts the prosecutor said
it is unclear what joachin's contact with the kouachi brothers entailed
as french officials dig deeper into the suspects behind the attacks they must deal with a new threat from an al qaeda affiliate
the affiliate in north africa the islamic maghreb published a threat against france on jihadist websites
france pays the cost of its violence on muslim countries and the violation of their sanctity the group said in its statement
as long as its soldiers occupy countries such as mali and central africa and bombard our people in syria and iraq and as long as its lame media continues to undermine our prophet france will expose itself to the worst and more

the attack was years in the making an aqap leader said in a video claiming u.s. born cleric anwar al awlaki was the mastermind behind it
al awlaki was the terror group's spokesman before a u.s. drone strike killed him in yemen in two thousand and eleven
for days intelligence analysts have been trying to piece together whether the gunmen who attacked the magazine met him on trips to yemen a theory that could be bolstered by the new video's claim
aqap did not claim responsibility for friday's deadly siege at a kosher grocery store in paris but praised it
what is al qaeda in the arabian peninsula 
french security services have identified a suspected accomplice in that attack according to the french newspaper le parisien
police sources cited by the newspaper said one line of investigation is that the accomplice a man from a paris suburb may have driven gunman amedy coulibaly to the kosher supermarket where coulibaly later shot dead four people
coulibaly was killed in a police raid to end the siege
said and cherif kouachi the brothers who authorities say were behind the charlie hebdo attack also are dead
but investigators efforts to track down possible suspects tied to last week's attacks are continuing
so is the magazine that the terrorists targeted last week
charlie hebdo's new edition hit newsstands wednesday a week after authorities say terrorists said and cherif kouachi burst into its newsroom and gunned down staffers
the cover features a cartoon of the prophet mohammed crying
all three million copies sold out quickly but more copies are coming soon the magazine said
the claim of responsibility for the deadly attack on the magazine came in a video showing aqap commander nasr ibn ali al ansi with pictures of the kouachis in the background
when the heroes were assigned they accepted
they promised and fulfilled al ansi said
he praised the attack saying it was revenge for charlie hebdo's depictions of mohammed
al ansi blamed not only charlie hebdo but also france and the united states
it is france that has shared all of america's crimes al ansi added
it is france that has committed crimes in mali and the islamic maghreb
it is france that supports the annihilation of muslims in central africa in the name of race cleansing
it was a blessing from allah that the kosher market siege in which four hostages were killed took place about the same time al ansi said
u.s. authorities said they think the video is authentic
but they weren't ready to say that aqap helped carry out the assault
we're not there yet
there are good indicators that the group was behind the attack but the intelligence community is still assessing a senior administration official told cnn
earlier in the day u.s. national security council spokesman alistair baskey said that if genuine this is only the latest example of the wanton brutality that is al qaeda's calling card and which it has visited upon innocents of all faiths
investigators believe cherif kouachi left yemen with as much as twenty thousand dollar from aqap to carry out attacks a u.s. official said
le parisien's report said investigators identified coulibaly's suspected accomplice using keys for a motorbike discovered in an apartment they raided over the weekend
neighbors told cnn the apartment in the paris suburb of gentilly was raided saturday by police
also found inside the apartment according to le parisien
a stash of weapons explosives and two isis flags
coulibaly purportedly told authorities before he was killed that he belonged to isis
police also suspect the man may have been responsible for shooting and wounding a jogger last week an attack that the paris prosecutor has said could be tied to coulibaly because the ammunition used was the same as ammunition found at the scene of the kosher market attack le parisien said
paris police would not comment to cnn on the contents of the report
le parisien says coulibaly's accomplice who the newspaper did not name is suspected to have fled france possibly for syria
officials have also said they believe hayat boumeddiene coulibaly's widow who may have played a role in the attacks has fled to syria
with france on its highest level of alert ten thousand troops have deployed across the country
thousands of police officers are on patrol including hundreds assigned to protect jewish schools
since the attacks dozens of cases have been opened in france against people accused of expressing support for terrorism since the attacks the justice ministry said
it's unclear how many people are blamed for the fifty four infractions
the cases include investigations involving phone threats cyberattacks and facebook posts the ministry said
some are in prison awaiting trial some have already been convicted and some have been released with a notice of a court date ministry spokesman pierre rance said
penalties for the alleged crimes vary rance said
justice minister christiane taubira considers that words or actions of a racist or anti semitic nature or that cause hateful violent or discriminatory behavior or advocate terrorism or target security forces must be fought and pursued with the utmost vigor her office said in a statement
she asked prosecutors to exercise extreme reactivity in the conduct of public action against the perpetrators of such crimes the statement said
with concerns on the rise a controversial french comedian was accused of publicly supporting terrorism french media reported
dieudonne m'bala m'bala known as dieudonne was arrested in paris according to media reports which tied his arrest to a recent facebook post from the comedian
je suis charlie coulibaly the post said combined the last name of one of the terrorists involved in last week's attacks with the widely used phrase expressing solidarity with victims
that post has since been deleted
dieudonne has previously been fined several times in france for anti semitic commentary
last year the french government said it wanted to ban his live performances
and british authorities banned him from entering the united kingdom
on monday dieudonne issued a statement with his stance on the terror attacks
since the beginning of last year i have been treated as public enemy number one when all i try to do is make people laugh and laugh about death he wrote in a letter to the french interior minister
because death laughs at us all as charlie knows now unfortunately
after his release from custody wednesday his lawyer told france's itele network that the comedian returned to performing his act at a theater in the same paris neighborhood where charlie hebdo's offices are located

the man was traveling in the oasis
it was early in the morning
he doesn't remember how he fell
fortunately another cruise the disney magic saw him said cozumel port captain alfonso rodrguez
the lucky man a twenty two year old u.s. citizen had been in the water for about five hours during last thursday's ordeal rodriguez said
at seven thirty one a.m. a passenger aboard disney magic reported a man in the water
the passenger had thrown multiple lifesavers in the water to help him said rodriguez
they rescued him and gave him medical attention
the man was taken to a local hospital and was in good condition before he was flown back to the united states rodriguez said
this man was reborn
most people that experience that kind of fall break their neck
it's like hitting concrete he said
david hearn a disney magic passenger recorded the rescue
in his video a yellow rescue boat bobs on dark ocean waters and a man's head and arms are barely visible above the waves
the man then swims toward the boat and is brought aboard
we were in our stateroom
on the speaker system we heard the crew saying mister m o b starboard side 
i got dressed and went up to the upper deck hearn said
m o b is the code used for man overboard
when hearn reached the magic's upper deck the ship's crew had already lowered the lifeboat
it was pretty surreal at first
it's not something you expect when you go on a nice cruise hearn said
our first question was where did he come from 
we thought it was someone that fell off our ship
hearn said he spoke to the passenger credited with spotting the man in the water
his daughter had gotten up and they had a room with a balcony
she wanted to sit out there and he went with her hearn recalled
they heard a noise and as the ship got closer they realized it was a man screaming for help
they got on the phone with guest services and the ship came to a stop
royal caribbean closed circuit tv video showed the man was alone on the oasis ship deck five when he went overboard at six seven a.m
there were no other guests or crew around at the time said cynthia martinez a royal caribbean spokeswoman
cnn's request for the video was denied
oasis of the seas is one of the world's largest ships with room for more than eight thousand passengers and crew
it had departed from port everglades florida on january three and cozumel was the last port of call martinez said
the ship's safety features include a minimum safety railing of forty two inches and more than one thousand two hundred security cameras
for their safety we recommend that guests not lean over or climb on any railing said martinez
but miami based maritime lawyer jim walker says these measures are not enough
instead he advocates automatic man overboard detection systems
this poor guy was pretty lucky
the real issues is why he fell off the ship and why there is no clear explanation walker said
automatic man overboard detection technology uses radar and sensors to establish a perimeter around a ship
a mechanism notifies the crew when a person has fallen overboard
one manufacturer of these systems mobtronic boasted a ninety five percents man overboard detection rate
the cruise vessel safety and security act requires large passenger ships to integrate technology that can be used for capturing images of passengers or detecting passengers who have fallen overboard to the extent that such technology is available
unlike this incident walker said the problem with most man overboard cases is that the person is never found and the case goes unsolved
there are some people who commit suicide he said
the suicides are easily detected because the person leaves a message or doesn't bring any luggage onto the ship or they sell their homes et cetera
but there are a whole group of cases that don't fall on the suicide pattern
there are other cases which we suspect are a result of foul play

it is a magazine cover depicting the prophet mohammed with a tear falling from his cheek holding a sign that says je suis charlie the slogan that became a worldwide meme
above mohammed are the words all is forgiven
on wednesday two muslim extremists attacked the offices of charlie hebdo a french magazine with a history of mocking mohammed
twelve were killed including several top editors by two men with terrorist connections who said they were avenging the prophet
many muslims object to any depictions of mohammed respectful or not saying that such images defy his teachings and lead to idolatry
for the secular satirists at charlie hebdo neither of those concerns seemed to matter much
they often lampooned mohammed crudely caricaturing him as a backward foolish figure
it's not surprising that in its first issue since the attack charlie hebdo again put mohammed on the cover
but this time instead of showing the prophet in an unflattering light the magazine struck a far different tone and was received by some muslims in a far different way
my initial thought is that the cover is a near perfect response to the tragedy said hussein rashid a professor of islamic thought at hofstra university in new york
they are not backing down from the depiction of mohammed exercising their free speech rights
at the same time the message is conciliatory humble and will hopefully reduce the anger directed to the muslim communities of france
zineb el rhazoui a columnist at charlie hebdo magazine who worked on the new issue told the bbc that the staff didn't want to express hatred toward the terrorists who killed her colleagues
the that happened in france after this horrible crime must open the door to forgiveness
everyone must think about this forgiveness
chosen by charlie hebdo's editors on monday night the cover was released by liberation the french newspaper that is sharing its office space with staffers from the satirical magazine
many media outlets have republished the cover in a show of solidarity
the issue will hit newsstands this wednesday in a flood of three million copies translated into multiple languages
as the new cover spreads across social media muslims responded with a mix of emotions from wariness to appreciation from miffed to dismissive
yahya adel ibrahim an imam in australia counseled his one hundred thousand facebook followers to follow the example of mohammed even if they encounter images that they believe are blasphemous
as it is clear that the cartoons are to be published again muslims will inevitably be hurt and angered but our reaction must be a reflection of the teachings of the one we love and are angered for ibrahim said
enduring patience tolerance gentleness and mercy was the character of our beloved prophet
on twitter some muslims were skeptical that publishing an image that many consider offensive should be construed as an act of solidarity
other muslims said they appreciate the magazine's sentiments
rashid noted that the cover's central message forgiveness resonates not only throughout islam but through other faiths as well
the cover is a call to our better angels and an acknowledgment that religion also offers good to the world
other muslim leaders criticized the cover
that the depiction appears benign is of little consequence because it will be seen as offensive and deliberately provocative said dawud walid executive director of the michigan chapter of the council on american islamic relations
there's nothing in the quran islam's primary text about depicting the prophet
but according to the hadith stories and sayings attributed to mohammed and his companions he discouraged muslims from making images of him
walid said that charlie hebdo's new cover will offend many but noted that over ninety nine point nine nine nine percents of france's five million muslims acted peacefully when the previous depiction was released
yasir qadhi an american cleric with a wide following said he's not pleased by any depictions of mohammed but it's clear that this hebdo cover unlike others is not meant to make fun of muslims
qadhi also said that while he respects the right to free speech there appears to be a double standard when it comes to what western society and hebdo find suitable for mocking
did you happen to notice any cartoons mocking the death of the cartoonists themselves and lampooning their work and efforts 
qadhi asked
satire of the type attempted by charlie hebdo often serves a valuable end said omid safi director of islamic studies at duke university
but safi faulted the french magazine for misfiring in its choice of targets
i see satire as always having a purpose of mocking the powers that be hierarchy power unearned privileged
so who are we speaking power to today 
safi said
sure violent terrorists
but what about all the other agents of violence including the state sponsored ones 
that's why i don't find charlie hebdo particularly good satire
many muslims seemed content not to comment on hebdo's latest depiction of their prophet or to pay it no mind
let us ignore the provocations and defamation and get about the work of being a source of good and mercy to all we may come into contact with imam zaid shakir a popular cleric and scholar from california posted on facebook this week
may allah bless you all and make things easy for you and your families during these trying times

watchdog groups are asking the predominantly sunni muslim nation to reconsider its stance toward atheists after authorities arrested a student and sentenced him to three years in prison for facebook posts that insulted islam
karim ashraf mohamed al banna was arrested with a group of people at a cafe in november according to the association for freedom of thought and expression
an egyptian minor offenses court sentenced him on blasphemy charges saturday in what human rights watch called part of a wider government push to combat atheism and other forms of dissent
atheists are one of egypt's least protected minorities although the constitution ostensibly guarantees freedom of belief and expression said sarah leah whitson hrw's middle east and north africa director
egyptian authorities need to be guided by the constitution and stop persecuting people for atheism
while article sixty four of egypt's constitution says freedom of belief is absolute it also says freedom to practice religious rituals or establish houses of worship is exclusive to judaism christianity islam the baha'i faith and other abrahamic religions
according to french press agency reports cited by hrw a researcher with the egyptian initiative for personal rights said a local newspaper identified al banna as an atheist and al banna's lawyer reported that the student's own father testified that he was fostering extremist ideas
among al banna's posts are a split image of a severely scarred woman and a quran with the caption it's ok to burn a woman
but it's not ok to burn a book
something is wrong with your priorities
another post carries the caption a big reward to whoever represents islam and shows several caricatures of bearded men in similar dress pointing at each other saying this person does not represent islam
a judge will hear al banna's appeal on march nine and his bail has been set at one thousand egyptian pounds his lawyer told the french press agency
hrw says that blasphemy cases generally stem from personal or unrelated disputes and since the country's two thousand and eleven uprising authorities have increasingly investigated complaints
while most of the cases involve alleged insults to islam hrw says that at least two men have been imprisoned for insulting christianity
authorities have also been targeting atheists of late according to hrw
police in december shut down a cairo cafe popular with suspected atheists and district administrative chief gamal mohie told a news outlet that the shop was unlicensed and popularly known as a place for satan worship rituals and dances hrw reported
also last month the dar al ifta which issues religious edicts in egypt released a survey claiming egypt had eight hundred and sixty six atheists more than any other middle eastern country
two aides to the grand mufti who heads dar al ifta and is the country's top official on religious laws told a newspaper that the increase in atheism should ring alarm bells
this follows a march promise from a top alexandria security official to arrest atheists and a june announcement by egypt's youth and religious endowments ministries that they would confront atheism

the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author
policymakers wring their hands about how to curtail the spread of extremist religious ideologies that terrorize western targets but also muslims and non muslim minorities in the middle east who are extremism's primary victims
where are some muslims getting the idea that violence against journalists who offend them is ok 
why do they see beheadings as a fitting punishment 
a good place to look for answers would be to examine saudi arabia's policies of intolerance and extremism
king abdullah as the protector of islam's most sacred religious sites and leader of saudi arabia is widely considered an important role model for muslims around the world
so it should not come as a surprise that many muslims take their cues from the country on the prohibitions and punishments they consider appropriate to inflict on those who challenge or disagree with their interpretations of islam
saudi arabia gave a good indication of its position on appropriate punishments last friday when it carried out round one of a public flogging fifty lashes against raif badawi a young blogger in front of the al jafali mosque in jeddah
a saudi court had fined badawi and sentenced him in two thousand and fourteen to one thousand lashes over twenty sessions and to ten years in prison for the crime of insulting islam in part for setting up a liberal website to debate various topics including religion
badawi is not the only saudi who has faced punishment for his perceived views
the government has jailed many leading intellectuals writers and activists who have dared to question any tenet of the orthodoxy imposed by the country's wahabi religious leaders
a former colleague of badawi suad al shammari was jailed in late two thousand and fourteen on charges of insulting the messenger and the hadith in connection with tweets that allegedly criticized religious authorities
in october a saudi court sentenced a shiite cleric nimr al nimr to death for criticizing the government and breaking allegiance with the ruler
the prosecutor had sought what the saudis call a crucifixion sentence the kingdom's harshest in which the convicted person is beheaded and the decapitated body displayed in public
there is so much shock and outrage about isis propaganda videotapes showing its beheadings of journalists in iraq and syria and most recently the reported beheadings of two tunisian journalists in libya
but the much more routine and widespread beheadings by saudi arabia get little scrutiny and condemnation
saudi arabia beheaded at least twenty six people last august alone
the eighty two executions in two thousand and fourteen make saudi arabia a world leader in capital punishment
saudi interior ministry news releases indicate that about half of them were for nonviolent crimes the other half for drug offenses and one for sorcery
yes you read that right
in two thousand and fourteen saudi arabia was still beheading people for sorcery
so is it really any surprise that extremist groups also acting in the name of islam seem to be following saudi's lead meting out their own severe punishments against journalists and activists they find offensive 
if saudi arabia thinks publicly beheading people comports with islamic religious teachings and deters those who also might want to criticize them or question their religion why shouldn't isis 
one might argue that a nation unlike some self designated islamic caliphate has the legitimacy and authority to exercise state sponsored violence including against its own citizens
but countries also have obligations to respect human rights
saudi arabia's abusive prosecutions and cruel punishments flout these obligations and undermine its own legitimacy
there is probably little governments and policymakers can do to influence the ideology of extremist armed groups
but there's a lot more they can and should do to influence the policies and practices of purported allies in the war on terror
that includes the anti isis coalition to which saudi arabia and many other unaccountable authoritarian and deeply abusive arab governments belong
while the united states and united kingdom governments statements condemning badawi's flogging were a good start more often these countries are utterly silent in the face of saudi arabia's grotesque abuses against its own citizens
the west's denunciations of isis abuses have less credibility when governments carrying out similar abuses if much smaller in scale and magnitude are good chums strong allies and important investors
if the international community is serious about taking on islamist extremist ideologies if it wants to see real models of tolerance respect for diverse viewpoints religious freedom and the free and peaceful exchange of ideas it must urge king abdullah to be the true protector of the rights of muslims around the world
for a start he can overturn the sentence against badawi and release dozens of detained activists and writers
he could even abolish beheadings overnight if that is what he wanted

at that demonstration some muslims held signs that not only echoed the rallying cry je suis charlie but also proclaimed je suis juif
the public overture was especially poignant at a time when the two communities are so often pitted against one another
but on the same day that brought this and other messages of hope the jewish agency for israel reported that hundreds of french jews attended an information fair in paris held under tight security to explore immigration to israel
though the event had been scheduled before last week's terror attacks the turnout suggested that for some french jews this unity rally may have come too late
numbering about a half million the jewish community in france is the largest in europe and third largest in the world after israel and the united states
rising anti semitism in recent years however has chipped away at the numbers
seven thousand french jews moved to israel in two thousand and fourteen according to the jewish agency
that number more than doubled the previous year's figure and for the first time more jews moved to israel from france than they did from any other country
the attack on the kosher market friday came during a manhunt for suspects in the killing of twelve at the satirical french magazine charlie hebdo two days earlier
four died in the market making it the deadliest attack on french jews in nearly three years
in march two thousand and twelve a teacher and three students were gunned down at a jewish school in toulouse
like the victims of the supermarket shooting the toulouse victims were also buried in israel
the practice of being buried there is a matter of faith not nationality cnn reported at the time and especially meaningful to those who are religiously observant
the consistory of paris which represents jewish communities said in two thousand and twelve that forty percents of practicing french jews opt for burial in israel
before the friday siege at the market even ended jewish businesses in the area were shuttered and paris largest synagogue the grande synagogue was closed for shabbat services for the first time since world war ii
the violence came after a year marred by unsettling developments in france a sampling of them listed by tablet an online jewish magazine
among the anti semitic incidents were reports of jewish teens who wore traditional jewish items like yarmulkes being assaulted with tasers tear gas and pepper spray
a jewish teacher leaving a kosher restaurant in paris was attacked his nose broken and a swastika drawn on his chest
two teens and their grandfather were chased by a group including a man wielding an ax as they walked to synagogue in paris
two french teenage girls plotted to blow up a synagogue in lyon
a kosher restaurant in paris was firebombed
a kosher supermarket was set ablaze in sarcelles
a man shook a mother's baby carriage at a bus stop in paris and said to her dirty jewess enough with your children already
between january and the end of july of two thousand and fourteen the most recent data available there were about six hundred and twenty anti semitic incidents in france a ninety one percents increase over the year before said simone rodan benzaquen the paris director of the american jewish committee a global jewish advocacy agency
the sad reality she added is that most of these anti semitic acts were committed by disenfranchised muslims
but this uptick is the result of two simultaneous developments in france said bobby ghosh a global affairs analyst for cnn
in conversation with cnn's jim sciutto ghosh pointed to the rise of the extreme right political party of marine le pen which is openly xenophobic and to the rise of islamic radicalism

flames of hatred were further fueled by israel's operation in gaza over the summer
anti israel demonstrations morphed into a new level of ugliness
about four hundred jews gathered in july to pray for peace at paris don isaac abravanel synagogue
they found themselves trapped inside for hours as demonstrators screamed death to the jews a witness outside the synagogue told cnn
some of the jews inside heard cries of jews to the oven and saw men brandishing knives and broken bottles
the level of danger is very new serge benhaim the synagogue president who was inside that day told cnn afterward
today and tomorrow for the jewish people in france is fully different from what it was yesterday
that was half a year ago
what lies ahead may look even more different
last week's three day siege by islamist terrorists left seventeen dead in and around paris
a policewoman was killed after the attack at the offices of charlie hebdo
the killings at the kosher market came as jews shopped in preparation for shabbat
and while the last attack was deemed obviously anti semitic one death at charlie hebdo may have been too
on friday cnn's erin burnett spoke to sophie bramly the cousin of elsa cayat the only woman killed at the magazine
other women were specifically told by the attackers that they would be spared because they were women and bramly believes cayat was not because she was jewish
bramly had spoken to cayat's brother the night before and learned that cayat a psychoanalyst and columnist had been receiving anonymous phone calls
they included threats like dirty jew you should stop working for charlie hebdo
otherwise we're going to kill you she told burnett
the press hasn't really talked about it that way here
it was only about freedom of speech that was attacked and my feeling was that religion was there too she said
and today the kosher market siege unfortunately seemed to prove that i wasn't totally wrong
perhaps if france had acted more forcefully when only jews were the targets of islamist violence this never would have happened some said on social media
others debated if there was a future for jews in france
some invoked the famous nazi defying quotation of german lutheran pastor martin niemller in sentiments such as first they came for the jews but i did not speak out because i wasn't a jew
then they came for the journalists
conspiracy theories blaming jews and israel for the charlie hebdo attack that killed bramly's cousin are already making the rounds the anti defamation league reported
the organization listed a flurry of accusations being made in the u.s. and abroad a number of them pointing fingers at the israeli intelligence agency mossad
the tunisia times the adl said ran an article friday that read the mossad hired muslims from arabic origins to carry the attack to increase hostility towards muslims worldwide
by sunday morning a makeshift memorial outside the kosher market drew crowds
members of the jewish community prayed and others came declaring je suis juif to show support
also on hand and shaking hands with parisian jews was naftali bennett the controversial right wing leader of the jewish home party in israel cnn's atika shubert reported
like other israeli politicians in recent days including prime minister benjamin netanyahu he shared the message that israel is home to any jews who want to move there
if they decide to come to israel we will accept them and embrace them he said
if they decide to stay here we will continue to make sure they're secure
the world has to wake up
several people in the crowd told cnn they planned to leave
the jewish community is no longer safe said one man
i will leave for israel a young woman said because unfortunately now here i'm afraid
later on sunday after the unity rally the grande synagogue filled for a memorial service
seated two rows behind israel's prime minister was soviet born natan sharansky who was sentenced in one thousand nine hundred and seventy seven to forced labor in a siberian prison camp or gulag
what landed him there for nine years was his human rights activism and insistence on making aliyah or moving to israel
today the israeli politician activist and author his books include fear no evil the case for democracy and defending identity is the chairman of the jewish agency
while seven thousand french jews made aliyah in two thousand and fourteen he recently told the jerusalem post that fifty thousand had inquired about it
and while a year ago information seminars about immigration to israel were held once a month in france he said they are now held twice a day
here you have for the first time a clear thing sharansky told the newspaper
there is a massive exodus from a community in the free world which has all the doors open to them and they are choosing israel
evidence of french jews moving to israel can be seen in ashdod a seaside community where an art center is modeled after the louvre and conversations at cafes are more likely to be in french than hebrew reported cnn's ian lee
high rise apartment buildings are under construction in ashdod and a developer told lee that since august the majority of buyers have come from france
a woman named catherine who only wanted to use her first name arrived two weeks ago
she told lee that friends and family would soon follow
the french government they say to us we don't want you to go she said in broken english
but they don't do nothing that makes us stay
the bulk of jews in france however are not ready to give up on their country said noam meghira vice president of the french union of jewish students
some people want to leave
this is their choice meghira told cnn's jim sciutto
but this is a minority
the majority of french jews are in france

they love this country and they want to stay here
it's why they too rallied in solidarity with the masses on sunday
they'd like to remember how a muslim employee at the kosher supermarket helped saved jews
they know a threat to them is also a threat to democracy
they point to beefed up security as evidence of how seriously their home country is looking out for them
about four thousand seven hundred officers have been tasked with securing seven hundred and seventeen jewish schools french prime minister manuel valls told cnn affiliate bfmtv
valls doesn't want jews to leave
france he's even said depends on their staying
the choice was made by the french revolution in one thousand seven hundred and eighty nine to recognize jews as full citizens valls told the atlantic's jeffrey goldberg before last week
to understand what the idea of the republic is about you have to understand the central role played by the emancipation of the jews
it is a founding principle
so if jews were to leave en masse the french republic would be judged a failure he said
if one hundred thousand french people of spanish origin were to leave i would never say that france is not france anymore said valls whom goldberg noted is the son of spanish immigrants
but if one hundred thousand jews leave france will no longer be france
while some people have left and perhaps more will rodan benzaquen the paris ajc director is not fretting about a mass exodus which she called overstated
she'd rather wait to see if france will do everything it can to make jews feel safe
i'm more worried about the state of mind of people who are in france and asking themselves if they have a future here she told cnn by phone late monday
it affects the way they live in this country
if they feel lonely or disconnected from france that would signal trouble
jews are totally intertwined with what the french republic is about she said
french jews are french and they want to continue living in the country
in fact when jews go to synagogue she said they offer up a special prayer
it is a prayer for the republic the place that for centuries has been their home

at wimbledon you got tied up naked and dragged through puddles or maybe someone nicked your car and drove it away to hide it or your shoes would get nailed to the top of a seat terry phelan a former player told cnn
or they would burn your clothes cut your clothes or your tie off or if you left your hotel key when you were out of a hotel you'd come back and your room would be trashed
though derided for their long ball style the small south london club achieved a rise in english football that was astonishingly fast
in one thousand nine hundred and seventy seven the unfashionable club entered the english football league starting in the fourth division
nine years later they were briefly top of what is today's premier league after a startling run of four promotions in five seasons
better was to come as the alley cats then defeated english football's aristocrats in one of the fa cup's greatest upsets as wimbledon beat liverpool dubbed the culture club by one commentator in the one thousand nine hundred and eighty eight final
although a smattering of players would go on to both bigger clubs and international careers there was one undeniable factor behind wimbledon's success
we've got the team spirit to carry us through replied future england international dennis wise when asked about the prospect of beating liverpool described that day by a bbc television presenter as arguably the greatest post war club we've seen in the one thousand nine hundred and eighty eight fa cup final
a variety of elements such as hard work tactics team discipline an early use of video data and in the final itself a dollop of good fortune underpinned wimbledon's success but unity was the key
this was achieved by bonding exercises that seem routine now but which were far from commonplace then such as army boot camps but others believe the togetherness was forged in an altogether less pleasant environment
we ruled by fear it was wonderful former striker john fashanu wimbledon's self proclaimed leader said in a controversial documentary broadcast by british television channel bt sport last month
fashanu said he dragged a teammate by his nostrils while he also spoke of players being locked in car boots or being forced to go two days without eating
then among myriad tales there were the regular fights that broke out often involving fashanu a black belt in karate
on the pitch there was mayhem as well there were the injuries suffered by opponents players most notably tottenham's gary mabbutt and gary stevens and manchester united's viv anderson in the stadium tunnel after the game as wimbledon's aggressive style and warrior mentality grimly spilled over
even more famous is a near iconic image of jones manhandling paul gascoigne's private parts as he tried to intimidate england's one thousand nine hundred and ninety world cup star
the culture at any club depends on the manager chief executive and owner as they tend to set the culture sports psychologist dan abrahams told cnn
wimbledon's owner at the time lebanese businessman sam hammam was and still is unorthodox to say the least
he realized that jesus had twelve disciples and all were very different fashanu told bt sport
sam was like jesus in our mind almost because he was a real leader
despite knowing little about football hammam bought the club on a whim and was soon introducing his unusual modus operandi contractually arranging that players would have to sit through opera if they lost by four goals while he once made coach bobby gould eat cooked sheep's testicles as a way of being persuaded that he really wanted to buy a certain player
the whole time sam hammam was there he encouraged us not to bully or be reckless but to be different and strong with each other neal ardley who came through wimbledon's youth system before making his debut aged eighteen in one thousand nine hundred and ninety one told cnn
ardley is now manager of afc wimbledon whose fa cup defeat by liverpool on january twelve revived memories of years gone by
several claims in the bt sport program have angered many of the other personnel involved who have dismissed the tales as wild exaggerations particularly the most serious account where a wimbledon player jones says a teammate was so badly beaten in a locker room fight that his badly torn calf muscle needed twenty thirty stitches
it has since been dismissed as a wrestling bout gone wrong by fa cup winner terry gibson
would any other workplace even a football club have tolerated what went on at wimbledon 
the first thing i'd think about was getting down to the pub and getting away from it having a drink defender john scales who joined in one thousand nine hundred and eighty seven told bt sport
i remember getting in the car and getting psyched up for training so i would be able to cope for it
i had to adapt and i adapted it took six months but it made me into the person i am added phelan who joined alongside scales and would play at the one thousand nine hundred and ninety four world cup for the republic of ireland
i'm not going to name them but i saw lads tears in their eyes and breaking down who couldn't handle it
but can fear really motivate a dressing room 
of course says psychologist abrahams
any team dynamic can be complex and there is more than one way
but a culture of fear is very explosive and if that was predominant it would have helped some players but hindered others
a culture of fears normally means things are out of control
between two thousand and seven and two thousand and thirteen rene meulensteen worked as assistant coach to manchester united's sir alex ferguson famed for his fearsome hairdryer rants where he would admonish players from close range in the dressing room
it's not fear but respect ultimate respect the dutchman told cnn
if you want the best time and time again you have to push people and push boundaries
the reason managers do it is because they know it's in those players
i'm sure ninety nine point nine nine percents of those players if asked would say the manager got the best out of them
the dutchman also believes the wimbledon managers first dave bassett and then fa cup winning coach gould were fully aware of what they were doing
i was the headmaster of the worst comprehensive school in the whole of england gould told bt sport
every morning you were going to walk in and there was going to be a problem
we spent pre season training at various army training camps around england and europe bassett wrote in an afc wimbledon match program as he angrily refuted much of the bt sport claims
they were tough beasting days but i wanted to build characters make players feel at ease in different surroundings
i also wanted bonding
it's up to the manager to allow the players some control added meulensteen
these players can keep the dressing room at the right temperature
take the relationship between sam allardyce and kevin nolan or jose mourinho and john terry they are the guys that pull the dressing room together he said referring to the west ham and chelsea managers and their respective captains
one former wimbledon player says it's wrong to single out the club for treatment even if the players did once strip him naked and leave him to run three miles back to the training ground
i didn't take that as bullying that was a practical joke germany's lutz pfannenstiel told cnn
we were going for a run in the park and it was a bit cold but to have been stripped naked and have to run back it was more fun than anything else
but there were lots of practical jokes that were not so funny almost wrong like pissing in someone's shampoo bottle especially with my long hair
i think these kinds of practical jokes wouldn't happen anymore but it worked a little bit then he explained
it was part of the culture that people took the mickey out of each other that people pushed each other on the field to perform so it was a much closer connection between some of the players but these days those sorts of things are not accepted said pfannenstiel
pfannenstiel who has played on all the world's continents says he found the culture of wimbledon's dressing room leaders replicated elsewhere
in brazil the way the older players were treating the younger players was just as hard as at wimbledon
it was very difficult for the youngsters in brazil to adjust
in some ways it was just too much
many times an older player slapped a younger player
let's put it this way when i was younger the typical way of having respect for the older guys was much greater than now says pfannenstiel who believes the changes came about in the early two thousand s
now a younger player will tell an older player to f off
but in that time whether in wimbledon or germany or brazil if you got off on the wrong foot nutmegged or showed disrespect to someone it was a problem
but it's not just football where respect for the elder has changed as it's happened in offices and businesses all over the world
as a manager ardley is well aware that in the twenty one st century different rules now apply in dressing rooms
in the past young players were hungry they used to have to do jobs stand up and be counted and deal with everything thrown at them
now you've got young lads who want everything done for them
academies in football have created a much better environment training facilities and coaching quality but they pamper them too much
but players at fourteen get treated like first team players
we're trying to get the right mix we want our players to have the best coaching and facilities but we also want that hunger
the forty two year old ardley is intent on instilling a steely mentality in his players
we want a hardworking environment and we're trying to change for the better to do that
but it's a fine line when trying to fire up a youngster between getting him to perform and getting him to clam up
society's a lot nicer today but also a lot weaker not as tough as it was twenty years ago
there is so much political correctness around that we have to be careful not to mollycoddle our next generation to the point where they haven't got the character to make it to the top

the documents show that amedy coulibaly and cherif kouachi were close associates and go into explicit detail on how the two paris attackers plotted to stage a prison break to free a fellow terrorist in two thousand and ten
coulibaly who is accused of killing a french police officer and killing four more people at a kosher grocery store was described as a logistics expert in charge of accumulating weapons and arms for the prison break plot
records show when he was arrested in two thousand and ten police found a huge cache of high caliber arms including two hundred and forty cartridges for machine guns for the specific goal of seriously hurting people through intimidation or terror acts
police also found computers with security and encryption and recipes for poison purportedly capable of killing a million people
cherif kouachi accused of killing twelve people after attacking the charlie hebdo magazine last week with his brother was implicated in the prison plot but he denied involvement and was not jailed for that
kouachi and coulibaly had a mentor in common a radical named djamel beghal
once known as al qaeda's premiere european recruiter beghal was convicted of conspiring to attack the u.s. embassy in paris
kouachi had met beghal in prison and once they were freed he would visit him with coulibaly bringing beghal food and money and sometimes spending days at his apartment
also part of the visits was coulibaly's partner hayat boumeddiene who's now on the run and wanted by police
court documents detail how kouachi and coulibaly plotted together hiding their conversations by using code names over disposable cell phones
but what about beghal 
does he have any direct connection to last week's attacks 
and what happened to him 
beghal was first arrested in dubai in two thousand and one for his role in the embassy plot
he was in custody until his trial and conviction in two thousand and five then released on house arrest in two thousand and nine
after beghal's release french authorities collected more than forty five thousand pages of wire transcripts and surveillance images of him including when he was under house arrest
the images include a two thousand and ten photo of beghal with cherif kouachi and two other men in a park
and a second photo also taken in two thousand and ten is of beghal with coulibaly who visited the recruiter in cantal france with boumeddiene
a western intelligence source verified the authenticity of the images obtained by cnn
beghal's time out of prison didn't last long
in two thousand and ten he was arrested and charged with involvement in same prison break plot that landed coulibaly in prison
he was sentenced to twelve years in prison and remains behind bars
beghal's ties to al qaeda stretch back before the nine eleven attacks in the united states against the world trade center and the pentagon the source said
in november two thousand beghal traveled to afghanistan for eight months also visiting pakistan
according to court records he was put in charge of the plot to blow up the u.s. embassy in paris an attack eerily similar to the one thousand nine hundred and ninety eight attacks against u.s. embassies in kenya and tanzania
the western intelligence source says beghal was given instructions to go to dubai and then morocco where he would lose his old passport and get a new one
he was then instructed to travel to spain where he would be given the equivalent of sixty thousand dollar to carry out the paris attack on the u.s. embassy
but begahl was stopped and questioned as he passed through dubai
according to the western intelligence source he confessed during interrogation to the planned attack on the embassy
he was ultimately convicted in a french court
u.s. authorities never brought charges against the french algerian as they did other al qaeda operatives involved in one thousand nine hundred and ninety eight attacks on u.s. embassies in east africa
beghal's mentor was finsbury park mosque cleric abu hamza al masri convicted just last week on terrorism charges and sentenced to life by a federal judge in new york
abu hamza is believed to have radicalized and influenced convicted terrorists shoe bomber richard reid and nine eleven's zacarias moussaoui
the source says beghal later took the name abu hamza out of respect for his mentor

as many as one hundred and twenty five people have been hospitalized in the state of uttar pradesh after drinking the toxic liquor monday according to officials
thirteen of the patients are on life support said s.n.s
yadav the chief medical officer for the district of lucknow
at least seventeen people lost their lives in lucknow hospitals yadav said adding that there were unconfirmed reports that others had died in their villages
in neighboring unnao district eight people died from drinking toxic liquor according to its medical chief geeta yadav
it was not immediately clear where the villagers got the poisonous alcohol
authorities have ordered an investigation into the incident

groups representing french muslims have urged authorities to step in to protect them in the same way as they have boosted security around jewish sites
all muslim organizations in france are concerned about the numerous anti muslim acts seen in the past few days and call on the authorities to be vigilant to ensure the security of mosques said dalil boubakeur rector of the great mosque of paris and president of the french council of the muslim faith
prime minister manuel valls told cnn's french affiliate bfmtv on monday that a number of mosques had been attacked in recent days with shots being fired in some cases
in other instances religious buildings have been set on fire a pig's head has been stuck to a prayer room door and messages of hate have been sprayed on walls according to french media reports
valls said the thousands of extra police and soldiers deployed to ensure national security since wednesday's attack on charlie hebdo would watch over mosques as well as jewish schools and synagogues
after attacks seven questions being asked about islam
france is at war against terrorism not islam or muslims valls told the french parliament on tuesday
france will protect all its citizens with determination and calmness he said
the union of islamic organizations in france or uoif urged the french authorities to take all the necessary steps to protect muslims and mosques as it rejected any link with terrorists
the group said there have been more than fifty anti muslim incidents including reports of shootings and threats
french muslims are worried and hoping for a rapid return to calm it said
security has been increased at muslim sites
terrorism and crime have no religion the group said in a statement
the uoif absolutely refuses that muslims and their places of worship should be implicated or targeted for terrorist excesses which are only down to their authors
the three terrorists who carried out last week's attacks killing seventeen people in the course of three days of fear have been linked to the islamist extremist groups isis and al qaeda
two of them brothers said and cherif kouachi who stormed the offices of charlie hebdo said they were acting to avenge the prophet mohammed
the magazine has previously published controversial images of the prophet seen as blasphemy by muslims and it's been revealed that the cover of the new edition to be published wednesday drawn by the attack survivors will again feature a cartoon of mohammed
with some three million copies set to be distributed there's scope for an angry reaction from those who see it as deeply offensive
but in his statement boubakeur urged the muslim community to remain calm and avoid an emotional reaction all the while respecting the freedom of opinion
many french muslims turned out in paris and elsewhere for huge national unity marches sunday keen to show they shared in the nation's horror and grief at the events of last week
some held placards saying je suis juif or i am jewish as a sign of solidarity with the four jewish people killed in the supermarket attack picking up on the widely embraced slogan je suis charlie
one young muslim woman named amina who held a sign declaring both statements as she marched told cnn that the killings were not down to religion
it is very important for me because as you can see jews and muslims shouldn't be enemies and they should refuse to be enemies she said
as a muslim amina said she had cried when she learned that so many people had been killed
here in france it is very very very difficult to live when you are muslim because they always think you are a terrorist
and when i heard that again muslims killed people because they were not ok with what they said i was totally ashamed and i was very sad she said
one of the twelve victims in the charlie hebdo attack was police officer ahmed merabet a french muslim of algerian descent
at a national ceremony in paris french president franois hollande eulogized him alongside two other slain officers franck brinsolaro and clarissa jean philippe awarding each the legion d'honneur
merabet's brother malek told reporters that ahmed had been proud of his name proud to be a police officer and proud to defend the values of the french republic
he was killed by false muslims said malek merabet warning of the dangers of a wider backlash against those who share his faith
i address myself now to all the racists islamophobes and anti semites he said
one must not confuse extremists with muslims
mad people have neither color or religion
i want to make another point
don't tar everybody with the same brush don't burn mosques or synagogues
you are attacking people
it won't bring our dead back and it won't appease the families

when governments try to curry favor with fanatics eventually the fanatics take the law into their own hands
in pakistan jihadis have killed dozens of people whom they accuse of blasphemy including a brave politiciansalmaan taseer who dared to call the blasphemy law a black law
we should fight the paris terrorists
but we should also fight the source of the problem
it's not enough for muslim leaders to condemn people who kill those they consider as blasphemers if their own governments endorse the idea of punishing blasphemy at the very same time
the u.s. religious freedom commission and the u.n. human rights committee have both declared that blasphemy laws violate universal human rights because they violate freedom of speech and expression
they are correct




editor's note
frida ghitis is a world affairs columnist for the miami herald and world politics review
a former cnn producer and correspondent she is the author of the end of revolution
a changing world in the age of live television
follow her on twitter fridaghitis
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author
murdoch the conservative media magnate never afraid to ruffle liberal feathers tweeted that muslims must be held responsible for their growing jihadist cancer
rowling the creator of harry potter deployed her rhetorical mastery
i was born christian she tweeted back
if that makes rupert murdoch my responsibility i'll auto excommunicate
at last count more than twenty thousand people had re tweeted her
the comedian aziz ansari shot back rups can we get a step by step guide 
how can my sixty year old parents in nc help destroy terrorist groups 
plz advise
there are few subjects as sensitive as easy to get wrong as the role of islam and the responsibility of the world's muslims in the terrorist barbarism plaguing much of the world today
murdoch is wrong
muslims all muslims are not responsible for what happened
but that's not the end of it
rowlings ansari and the tens of thousands who favorite their tweets are right in saying this is not the fault of all muslims nor is it exclusively up to them all of them to take on the battle
but the tweets leave out a fundamental part of the problem
muslims have a crucial role to play in fighting extremist acts committed in the name of their religion and indeed many of them are doing it
from social media to the highest spheres of power there are muslims demanding reform demanding reaffirmation of individual freedoms and rejecting violence
ansari's parents need not drop everything they're doing and head for the fight against isis
but individuals in this era of high connectivity can argue for their beliefs
ansari for one with a large following and gift for communicating his views has the ability to advance the conversation away from both extremes
there are people to persuade on all sides not just that murdoch is wrong but also that the ideology of the terrorists is wrong
a pew poll of fourteen thousand two hundred and forty four people in fourteen countries with large muslim populations revealed a few months ago significant minorities of muslims believe suicide bombings are justified to defend islam from its enemies
in bangladesh forty seven percents said suicide bombings are acceptable in gaza sixty two percents agreed in egypt twenty four percents did
those are alarming numbers a sign that murderous extremism is indeed a problem one that muslims should view with urgency not least because the vast majority of suicide bombings of terrorism of all kinds kills muslims
thousands of muslims including europeans have joined the viciously violent isis which by some accounts enjoys the support of a rather large minority of french and european muslims
that is excellent news for europe's extreme right wing politicians who have built their careers on racism and religious prejudice most recently against muslims and immigrants from muslim countries and have found a populist sweet spot in the carnage
after the killings at charlie hebdo and the subsequent siege and murder of jewish shoppers at a paris kosher market the stage is set for anti immigrant parties to make gains in europe
and the barbarism ranges well beyond
hundreds of schoolgirls kidnapped in nigeria by the islamist terrorist group boko haram whose name applies the islamic term haram what is forbidden to boko a word used to described a western education
even as the media was focused on paris boko haram slaughtered thousands more in nigeria including many children wiping out entire villages
these attacks should bring together a coalition spanning the political spectrum including muslims christians and jews conservatives and liberals the overwhelming majorities of whom favor the defense of personal freedoms
and muslims should stand in the vanguard of that coalition with their arms thrown across the shoulders of jews signifying rejection of the intolerance that has made itself at home among far too many of their coreligionists
there is a war of ideas raging in the muslim world
the prize is the soul of modern islam
it's not enough to say this is not my fault
terrorists say they fight on behalf of muslims
muslims can not be mere bystanders
but there is a well meaning segment of the population particularly among the left that stubbornly tries to deny the religious context of the terrorist attacks and the need for it to be addressed within muslim communities
by doing this the left and the center push people to the right that is people who agree with murdoch's views
this is because many voters know the denial is dishonest or blind
those who close their eyes to the religiously inspired motivation of the killers and of their religion inspired goals are just as mistaken
are all muslims responsible 
are they guilty 
no of course not
do they have a responsibility to help fight this growing threat 
yes absolutely yes
in some respects it is reminiscent of the role of the german people in the aftermath of world war ii
today's germans are not guilty of what their parents and grandparents did
but they have a special role in preventing a resurgence of those odious and dangerous views
it's not islamophobic to acknowledge that most of the terrorism we see today is being perpetrated by people who say they want sharia islamic law that they want a muslim caliphate that they reject modernity in favor of life in the way of the prophet mohammed's day
we have seen isis the self styled caliphate or islamic state kidnapping raping and enslaving women
beheading hostages europeans and americans but mostly muslims
islamist terrorists organizations committed to imposing their views of what their religion commands are killing without mercy in syria iraq egypt israel somalia pakistan india france belgium canada australia and elsewhere
only the perpetrators their supporters and their enablers are guilty
don't let anyone use the tragedy to score political points or to denigrate muslims as a whole
but don't deny the truth
there is a dangerous problem within islam that must be addressed by muslims with the support of the rest of the world
both extremes in this discussion have it wrong and by perpetuating their distortions they harm efforts to protect tolerance from the intolerant
to make the world safe for muslims and non muslims for everyone including those lobbing grenades backs and forth in social media

the court of cassation ruled tuesday that mubarak and his two sons will stand trial again after accepting their appeal state media reported
mubarak his sons gamal and alaa and four new defendants are accused of embezzling seventeen point nine million dollar allocated for the renovation of presidential palaces
mubarak was sentenced last year to three years in prison
his sons to four years each
they have maintained their innocence
the mubaraks appealed saying their sentences were too harsh
mubarak ruled egypt as president for twenty nine years before he was ousted during the arab spring protests
in another case he was convicted in two thousand and twelve of issuing orders to kill peaceful protesters during the country's two thousand and eleven uprising and was sentenced to life in prison
he appealed and was granted a new trial last year
in november he was cleared of those charges and of corruption

consider the choice of targets of the terrorists
a magazine that in the terrorists minds had insulted the prophet mohammed
before they died on friday one of the kouachi brothers who carried out the attack on the charlie hebdo magazine spoke on the phone to a french journalist saying we are just telling you that we are the defenders of prophet mohammed
consider that the other target of the terrorists was a kosher store serving jews
virulent anti semitism is of course a staple of militant islamist ideology
militants can point to the quranic verse o believers take not jews and christians as friends as religious proof for this position
consider also that the three terrorists believed in their own minds that they were holy warriors who would die martyred in their holy war and that they would live on in paradise
one of the terrorists cherif kouachi planned to fight in the iraq war against the americans but was detained by french authorities in two thousand and five before could execute his plan
kouachi told french investigators that the wise leaders in islam told him and his friends that if they die as martyrs in jihad they would go to heaven and that martyrs would be greeted by more than sixty virgins in a big palace in heaven
this refers to the hadith or saying of the prophet mohammed that martyrs will enjoy the favor of seventy two virgins
before he was killed another of the terrorists amedy coulibaly recorded a martyrdom video in which pledged his allegiance to the leader of isis
in the video he said i am firstly addressing the caliph of the muslims abu bakr al baghdadi

i pledged allegiance to the caliph as soon as the caliphate was declared
this statement refers to the belief that a muslim caliphate or empire will stretch across the muslim world and will be led by a caliph who is the political and religious successor of the prophet mohammed
the fact that the paris attacks have something to do with islamic beliefs can not be wished away either by claims that islam is simply a religion of peace or by political correctness or because we live in an increasingly secularized modern era that often doesn't take deeply held religious beliefs sufficiently seriously
the reason that islamist militants can assert that jihad is necessary against the perceived enemies of islam is that there is sufficient ammunition in the quran to buttress their beliefs
the same could also of course be said for the old testament which is full of scenes of violent death visited on the enemies of god
and it is also the case that only a tiny minority of muslims are willing to do violence in the name of allah
nonetheless a well known verse in the quran which for believers is literally the word of god commands muslims that they fight and slay the nonbelievers wherever you find them seize them beleaguer them and lie in wait for them in every stratagem of war
the same verse adds that if the nonbelievers repent and pay what is rendered in some translations of the quran as charity to the poor and in others as a tax to muslims then they can be spared
indeed when osama bin laden made a formal declaration of war against the jews and the crusaders in one thousand nine hundred and ninety eight he cited this quranic verse at the beginning of his declaration
assertions therefore that islamist terrorism has nothing to do with islam are as nonsensical as claims that the crusades had nothing to do with christian beliefs about the sanctity of jerusalem or that the exponential growth of israeli settlements on palestinian lands are not rooted in the beliefs of certain fundamentalist jewish groups about the god given rights of jews to live in their god given homeland
after paris attacks seven questions being asked about islam
indeed there is an explicitly religious civil war driven by terrorist groups such as isis al qaeda and hezbollah unfolding in the middle east in countries such as iraq syria and yemen that pits ultrafundamentalist sunnis against ultrafundamentalist shias
this war could well replicate the religious thirty years war that tore apart seventeen th century europe in both viciousness and length
already hundreds of thousands have died in these conflicts
elements in the gulf arab states and iran have helped to foment this regional civil war
certain gulf arabs support proxy jihadist sunni groups such as al qaeda's affiliate in syria while iran supports shia militant forces such as hezbollah
islam is to be sure a big tent and the one and a half billion muslims in the world run the gamut from mystical moderate pacific sufis to salafists
salafism is an ultrafundmentalist branch of islam that is particularly prevalent in saudi arabia
salafism is intolerant of what its adherents consider to be islamic deviancy such as shia islam as well as of other religions such as judaism or christianity and it offers scant roles for women outside the home
salafism is not however a gateway to violence for the tens of millions of its peaceful adherents around the world
that said while very few salafists are terrorists jihadist terrorists are almost invariably salafists
a similar point could also be made about christian fundamentalists in the united states
very few kill abortion clinic doctors but anyone who kills an abortion clinic doctor in the states is almost invariably a christian fundamentalist
for terrorists such as those who carried out the attacks in paris last week their salafism also became increasingly politicized
to boil it down they adopted the ideology of what can be termed binladenism as it was osama bin laden who laid out this ideology for a global audience in a series of interviews and statements he made before he was killed in two thousand and eleven
before we get into an explanation of this ideology it might be helpful to explore what an ideology is
it is an idea or set of ideas that claims to fully explain the world and often history itself
examples of such ideologies might include marxist leninism which claimed that history could only be understood in material terms as a class struggle between the capitalists and the workers
another such ideology was nazism which asserted that the german aryan race's rightful dominant place in the world could only be attained by the enslavement or elimination of supposedly inferior ethnic groups particularly jews
ideologies by their nature are not susceptible to challenges posed by countervailing evidence
whether they are secular or they are religious they are fundamentally theological in the sense they are belief systems that are not open to question or scientific inquiry
you either believe
or you don't
common to many ideologies is the belief that history has a direction and a purpose and that at the end of this history the world will be transformed into a utopia
in marxist leninism's case this utopia was the classless society of true communism and for nazism it was the thousand year reich
in the minds of the true believers the only possible explanation for why these nirvanas haven't been attained as yet is that a pesky set of enemies are standing in the way
since such groups are blocking the creation of utopia they are not simply just obtuse they are in fact evil and therefore must be exterminated
this belief explains both stalin's campaign to murder millions of russians who were purported to be counterrevolutionaries as well as hitler's holocaust
similarly the ideology of binladenism is the belief that the world will finally be made perfect after the restoration of a taliban style caliphate that will stretch across the muslim world from indonesia to morocco
its supporters brand as evil the people and nations that they perceive are standing in the way of this dream including jews israel any middle eastern regime that doesn't follow taliban style rule the united states and its western allies such as france
in bin laden's telling there was a global conspiracy by the west and its puppet allies in the muslim world to destroy true islam and this conspiracy is led by the united states
religious based moral outrage about western foreign policy in the muslim world a key tenet of the ideology of binladenism is a recurring theme that crops up with many militant islamist militants
the paris terrorists shared in this
one of the terrorists amedy coulibaly recorded a video before he died saying that the bombing of isis positions in syria and iraq by western countries had motivated his attacks
if you attack the islamic state we will attack you

you and your coalition you bombarded regularly over there
for the paris terrorists as it was for bin laden the only answer to the purported western assaults on islam is revenge
that explains nine eleven and it also explains the terrorist attacks in paris last week
to claim that these attacks had nothing to do with a number of islamic beliefs albeit cherrypicked is preposterous

fung fifty nine who prefers not to divulge his full name lives in an illegal rooftop slum a seventy five square feet shack just big enough to host a bed a cupboard and everyday knick knacks thrown pell mell in the dusty room
the rent costs one thousand seven hundred dollar hong kong dollars a month
local authorities have been taping eviction notices on his front door for the past month saying that he has to move out
but with high property prices and hundreds of thousands waiting for public housing in hong kong fung has no other places to go
i won't accept the relocation settlement scheme it's only a few thousand hong kong dollars
where am i going to live 
the rent is a lot cheaper here he says as he crumples the latest notice
the authorities offer a relocation settlement for rooftop residents to fung it is too meager
most people in his position don't have a stable income to start again elsewhere
the rooftop slums in hong kong expose one of the most bewildering facets of asia's self described world city
majestic skyscrapers loom over peeling overcrowded apartment blocks with their unofficial rooftop extensions
constructed on top of buildings since the one thousand nine hundred and fifty s and sixty s without government approval these makeshift communities clutter the rooftops in old working class neighborhoods such as kowloon
corrugated metal sheets roughly cover concrete walled shacks
and they've provided vital accommodations for low income people such as migrants from mainland china and southeast asia for more than half a century
according to the latest figures from hong kong's census and statistics department there were three thousand seven hundred and forty seven rooftop dwellers in one thousand five hundred and eighty eight households in two thousand and eleven
this is a dramatic drop from two thousand and one when more than sixteen thousand people lived illegally in these sky slums
the decrease marks a trend where tenement buildings under constant pressure due to the shortage of land in hong kong are torn down to pave way for brand new shopping and residential developments

life inside the densest place on earth
remembering kowloon walled city
fung lives in one of hong kong's poorest and most densely populated districts kwun tong where fifty seven thousand one hundred and twenty people live per square kilometer according to the census and statistics department
atop an industrial building that houses textile and publishing companies fung and around forty other residents navigate their way through dark and haphazardly boarded walkways occasionally lit up by an overhanging light bulb or the glowing screen of a smartphone
tangled electric wires that also double as laundry lines criss cross from one end of the roof to the other
an open square lies in the middle scattered with pieces of unwanted furniture flower boxes and kids toys which strangely bring color and cheer to the crowded space
fung works mostly in the construction sector and earns around eight thousand dollar hong kong dollars a month barely enough to take care of his ten year old daughter and to cover the rent
i used to own property in shenzhen but i moved back to hong kong four years ago so my daughter can have a better education here fung said as his neighbors trickled out to join the conversation
they have all received the same warning from the government
some have lived on this rooftop for more than ten years and see no alternative but to stay
the rooftop dwellers are willing to open the doors to their humble homes but will only talk off the record in fear of being resettled to remote satellite towns where there may be few opportunities and limited social networks
a few buildings away from where fung lives joyce ngan chau yee who is a student at the university of hong kong school of professional and continuing education says she prefers to live in the rooftop huts
she lives with her single mother and brother in a two hundred and thirty six square feet flat
the space here is a lot bigger than the subdivided flats
it was a little bit uncomfortable at first with all the rats and the cockroaches but we learn to adapt the twenty one year old says
the only thing is that it gets really hot during the summer
the rooftop slums in the neighborhood are unofficially rented out by the building's top floor owners who want to earn some cash on the side according to fung
for ngan's mother she says she has no idea who she's been paying her rent to for the past three years
i just put the money in an envelope that comes every month on time and that is it says sze suk pui
the housing crunch highlights the widening economic divide for the city of seven million residents
the reality is that a part of hong kong society's income is not increasing while the rich are getting richer says economist richard wong yue chim
forbes magazine last year registered forty five billionaires in hong kong with a combined wealth of ustwo hundred and fourteen billion dollar almost eighty percents of hong kong's gdp in two thousand and thirteen
in contrast there are four hundred thousand households living under the poverty line which is set at fourteen thousand three hundred dollar hong kong dollars for a house of four
a survey published in early two thousand and fourteen by demographia international housing affordability revealed that hong kong's property market has become the world's most expensive with the median housing price reaching four million twenty four thousand dollar hong kong dollars or usfive hundred and nineteen thousand two hundred and sixteen dollar
the hike in property prices signifies a thriving economy in hong kong and construction jobs have been on the rise to meet the housing demand
they provide increasing job opportunities for people like fung who work in the sector but their financial struggles suggest that little of the money generated from the construction boom trickles down into their pockets

with inflating property prices and an ever widening income gap what future lies in store for these rooftop dwellers 
of course i don't want to live here forever says ngan pausing to speak during her homework
i hope we can move into public housing after living here for seven years but the wait will be long
when construction worker fung was asked about his future plans after his imminent eviction he just chuckled
i'll think about that when they really come and tear this down
if i can live here for one more day i'll continue to stay here
he says

the violent events left at least seventeen dead
for the brand new paris philharmonic scheduled to open this week the show must go on even when the city surrounding still reels from the violence
amid unprecedented displays of unity and defiance in the wake of the attacks the philharmonic aims to celebrate those who lost their lives dedicating its debut concerts to the victims
rising in the northeast of paris like a shimmering metallic starship the new venue's opening is intended as a historic moment for the city and performance groups who will call it home
controversy has beset the building designed by architect jean nouvel
it's gone over budget was still having its stainless steel and aluminum outer shell installed a week before the opening and has been criticized for its location
it is in the la villette quarter in the nineteen th arrondissement a stone's throw from the boulevard peripherique paris ring road
against a backdrop of turbulent times the people behind the venue will be hoping for positive reviews to cement its reputation
eight years in the making the starkly modern building is unlike most other structures in paris but it manages to fit into the already eclectic architecture in the surrounding parc de la villette
other buildings here including a science museum and the zenith concert hall feature similarly un parisian architecture a group of misfits that have found refuge together
speaking before last week's events paris orchestra's director paavo jarvi spoke of his excitement about the new philharmonic
it's not every day that someone will build you a brand new concert hall of these dimensions he said
a grammy award winning conductor jarvi will be directing the orchestra's first shows which start wednesday
they feature french artists and composers including a world premiere composition by thierry escaich
like all new things there is a bit of anxiety and apprehension and a bit of unknown actually he said admitting that his orchestra hadn't yet practiced on the stage which was still under construction the week before the gala events
the orchestra currently plays at the smaller salle pleyel in the chic eighth arrondissement but jarvi is thrilled about the move
it's sort of unbelievable that this actually going to happen he said
although nearly three times the initial budget the three hundred and eighty six million euro project has drawn criticism over funding disputes
some also worry that the neighborhood will alienate older patrons in the west of paris though others say it'll attract a younger less affluent audience including those from nearby suburbs
french minister of culture and communication fleur pellerin has defended the philharmonic saying the hall will be the envy of orchestra directors worldwide
no european capital will have a hall like this with such acoustic quality or capacity she told lci radio in december
the main concert hall has two thousand four hundred seats making it one of the largest of its kind in europe
retractable portions of seating will allow up to three thousand six hundred and fifty people on special occasions
it features modern sleek almost organic interiors that are a far cry from the gilded walls and red fabrics that line more traditional orchestra venues like the theatre des champs elysees
with seats surrounding the stage the design offers a closer experience with the music
sound experts from japan and new zealand have ensured state of the art acoustics in the main auditorium the most important thing for the orchestra
but it's not an exact science so we are keeping our fingers crossed that the acoustic gods smile on us jarvi says
in addition to the philharmonic's bar cafe five public rehearsal rooms and an one thousand eight hundred square meter educational center its musee de la musique features a new temporary exhibition space to complement a permanent collection
the first show will feature works centered on david bowie featuring costumes photos and other mementos from the performer's personal life
there'll also be a strong family and educational component with weekend family events and workshops allowing more interaction than that found currently in paris's big name halls
the philharmonic's location in the parc de la villette is also home to the national conservatory for music and dance as well as the cite de la musique a site well known by music enthusiasts
since one thousand nine hundred and ninety five the center has hosted exhibits and concerts for parisians
the addition of the new building however will bring additional cultural offerings to a slowly gentrifying district including pantin just across the beltway where companies like chanel have recently opened ateliers
by orienting itself toward these up and coming suburbs the philharmonic potentially opens itself to new audiences
but whether or not younger suburbanite crowds will fill the venue remains to be seen
prices for ticketed shows start at ten euros on the philharmonic's website and books are open for the two thousand and fifteen season
more details on the season can be found here at the philharmonic's season calendar


although the show is over forty years old this year's event held from january six nine saw some of the most futuristic products ever from driverless vehicles to a revolutionary battery which according to its makers could let you fully charge a cell phone in minutes

quality time in private space will be the true luxury goods in the future said dieter zetsche head of mercedes benz cars in his ces keynote speech

the victims of last week's terror attacks in paris are mourned

chinese customs officials on sunday busted a hong kong man trying to sneak ninety four iphones into the mainland by strapping them on his body
the man caught the attention of inspectors at the futian crossing in shenzhen a southern chinese metropolis bordering hong kong when he walked like someone carrying a heavy load despite appearing to travel light customs officials told cnn on tuesday
after finding nothing suspicious in his two plastic shopping bags officials asked the man to pass through a metal detector and the alarm went off
photos released by customs authorities show dozens of neatly shrink wrapped shiny iphones strapped around the man's chest abdomen crotch and thighs with duct tape
officials discovered both the iphone six and iphone five s models and estimated the total value of the devices to exceed three hundred thousand yuan
the man whose record revealed numerous previous run ins with customs regulations was held for further questioning
apple's iphones are immensely popular in mainland china
in october it took just six hours for customers of the country's three mobile carriers to reserve one million units of the iphone six and iphone six plus ahead of their official launch
apple handsets are more expensive in the mainland than hong kong however due to higher import taxes
an iphone six with sixty four gigabytes of storage for instance sells for almost one thousand dollar in the mainland but only about eight hundred and twenty dollar in hong kong and the price difference has created a huge and lucrative black market supplied by smugglers
shenzhen customs officials disclosed that they have caught eighteen mules strapping smuggled electronic products including two hundred and eighty two iphones on their bodies since december
for the hong kong mule caught on sunday he may have lost his ninety four iphones but likely made the record books

the murderers acted with a key demographic in mind knowing that millions of people would tune in to watch
so the camera has created a new kind of crowd in the course of our long history of public beheadings
its entrance on the scene in france on seventeen june one thousand nine hundred and thirty nine had a similarly immediate and unequivocal effect
that morning the public guillotining of german serial killer eugen weidmann outside the saint pierre prison in versailles was filmed by a spectator unbeknownst to the authorities
you can see the footage online today
photographers also recorded the action and their pictures filled newspapers and magazines in the days after weidmann's death
as if the rowdy crowds on the day were not bad enough now the action could be viewed again and again by untold thousands of voyeurs
after that the guillotine was rolled away behind prison walls not because decapitations were too horrifying to watch but because people will watch them no matter how horrifying they are
for centuries public executions had been intended to terrify by example when for many they were little more than light entertainment
the advent of film proved this beyond doubt.if the history of beheadings tells us anything it is that there will always be people who want to see
today the internet offers us front row seats on the understanding that no one need know we have taken our places to watch
murders can be nothing to do with us even as we click on the screen to play the film
in the twenty one st century spectators experience a sense of detachment from the event which has already happened at some point in the past and in another world supposedly far removed from our own alongside an unprecedented sense of intimacy
now we can watch close up but in private in our own time and space
the recent isis beheadings were experienced by many viewers like a gruesome serial drama and the murderers know we will tune in for the next episode
even those who do not watch the isis show can hardly avoid the media analysis that accompanies each instalment
producing these films requires relatively little organization money or complicated technology
compared to other terrorist offenses it is low tech and high impact
the action can be carefully choreographed while retaining its ruthless authenticity and the results are sensational
the camera has become a new stage for public beheadings a new spike for displaying a trophy head
when pathological criminals behead innocent civilians the murderers address their audience and present their spoils drawing those who watch into their narrative
the entire spectacle denotes the powerlessness of the victim and by extension the powerlessness of their countrymen to intervene
spectators who watch beheadings online impotently fulfil the perpetrators desire to be seen
the isis murderers have relied on sophisticated manipulation of social media sites to ensure that their footage appears on our screens before we even know what we are watching
at the same time a person's reaction can reverberate through the cyber crowd instantaneously creating the kind of group mentality that mirrors the dynamics of a real crowd
when the footage of james foley's murder circulated via social media platforms like twitter and facebook in august two thousand and fourteen a syrian activist named hend amry asked people not to share it and initiated the hashtag isismediablackout
pour water on their flame she tweeted
the movement to boycott the film gathered momentum in the hours that followed and twitter responded by removing tweets that embedded the video or screenshots of it
for the first time since the death of daniel pearl in pakistan in two thousand and four the silent majority found a voice and more and more members of the crowd refused to watch
a group of militants had tried to make an impact in an appalling way and their efforts were beginning just beginning to fail
when the victim of a beheading is bound and defenceless he or she becomes a pawn in somebody else's production
the power no longer derives from the act of decapitation itself which may require a pathological perpetrator but it does not require the luck and skill to win a fight
instead the power emerges from the reception the slayer receives as he plays his part on the stage
there is no triumph in the killer's actions until we watch
modern technology may offer a hiding place to voyeurs but it can also give a voice to human decency
no good can ever come from murder but if public opinion is able to neutralize the killers triumph by refusing to broadcast the graphic imagery they want us to see then this is a step forward

now four days after yoav hattab twenty one yohan cohen twenty two philippe braham forty five and franois michel saada sixty three were shot dead at the hyper cacher kosher supermarket the final tragic chapter to the charlie hebdo terror attacks in the french capital that shocked the world their devastated families have laid them to rest at the givat shaul cemetery in jerusalem
family members wrapped in coats to ward off the chill on a sunny tuesday morning embraced each other and wept as the bodies of their loved ones arrived
they were joined by hundreds of other people many of whom traveled from france to mourn the deadliest attack on that country's jewish community since two thousand and twelve
some were draped in the israeli flag
others carried signs bearing the faces of the dead and words in french declaring i am dead because i am jewish and i am charlie i am jewish i am israeli i am french and i've had enough
the wife of braham thanked the crowds that gathered to pay tribute to the fallen
what can i say 
philippe my dear love
he was a perfect person always a husband a father who lived only for his children
today he is with my son
i'm crying but i know that you all cry with me and i thank all of you for all of this
philippe protect yourself protect me

and so the people of israel the state of israel hug you with love in this dark day when four souls came to jerusalem
the final resting place of philippe yohan yoav and franois michel
may their souls rest in peace
netanyahu also called for a unified response in the face of last week's terror attacks
these are not only the enemies of israel
they are the enemies of the world and the time has come that all civilized people should come together and should uproot these enemies from amongst us

braham's widow lit another with nathan sharansky the chairman of the jewish agency
hattab's father the chief rabbi of tunis tunisia lit a candle with joel mergui the jewish central consistory president
cohen's sister joined ham korsia the chief rabbi of france in lighting one in memory of her brother
in an emotional speech israeli president reuven rivlin called on european leaders to take steps to wipe out anti semitism
we can't get away from the fact that this terror is particularly harsh on the jewish people he said
it would be dangerous to get away from the fact that there is anti semitism old anti semitism or new anti semitism
it doesn't matter what the terrorists think
the leaders of europe they have to take an active part and with a strong hand they have to ensure the security of the jewish people in europe
it's unacceptable that in two thousand and fifteen that people of israel are unable to wear the skullcap on the streets of europe and that cemeteries and synagogues have to be protected and we can not get away from it anymore
the killings of the four hostages by amedy coulibaly came two days after the terrorist's associates massacred twelve people in an attack on the french satirical magazine charlie hebdo in paris

who were the seventeen victims 
hattab one of seven children was a student in paris who traveled often to see his family in tunisia according to his facebook page
you are the magnificent tunisian that we will treasure forever
rest in peace fatma ben hamouda wrote on the page
cohen was a student who was working at the hyper cacher market
his parents were from algeria and settled in sarcelles in the one thousand nine hundred and sixty s according to french news outlets rtl and afp

franois michel saada was a retired senior executive whose children live in israel
he was married to laurence saada a psychomotor therapist for more than thirty years according to rtl and afp
braham worshipped at a synagogue in the paris suburb of montrouge and his children attended a jewish school not far from where a police officer was killed last thursday the day before his own life was taken allegedly by the same man in the supermarket siege

the names of the prisoners were not given
the move comes as part of a deal announced december seventeen to normalize relations between the united states and cuba
both nations have previously released political prisoners in a show of goodwill
american alan gross headed home on humanitarian grounds from cuba last month
in a separate swap a u.s. intelligence source held for twenty years was released in exchange for three jailed cuban spies
u.s. state department spokeswoman marie harf provided details about the timing of the releases on monday
a small number of the fifty three prisoners identified by the u.s. side were released in the summer and fall she said
a few additional prisoners were released before december seventeen
in the period since then
the cuban government has released all fifty three persons whose names were shared by the u.s. government harf told reporters
she added
we know there are going to be human rights concerns we still have when it comes to cuba but we are very pleased that they followed through on this commitment
her point was echoed by erika guevara rosas americas director at amnesty international who commented on the releases last week
prisoner releases will be no more than a smokescreen if they are not accompanied by expanded space for the free and peaceful expression of all opinions and other freedoms in cuba she said
according to amnesty which cited the cuban commission for human rights and national reconciliation eight thousand eight hundred and ninety nine short term detentions were reported last year compared with six thousand four hundred and twenty four in two thousand and thirteen
the good will expressed by the cuban authorities with this series of releases must absolutely translate into the implementation of a new human rights agenda
respect for freedom of expression assembly and association must be the next step if the cuban authorities want to keep their credibility in the face of a world which is watching them the americas director said

the fatal victims ranged in ages from eighteen to sixty state run mozambique radio said
more than three dozen people remained hospitalized tuesday the outlet said
a group of people returning from a funeral stopped off late friday in an area where customers can buy a popular home brew made from sorghum bran corn and sugar and known as phombe according to state run radio mozambique
by saturday morning dead bodies of those who drank the phombe began arriving at a hospital the radio station reported citing paula bernardo a health official in the district of cahora bassa
as we prepared to determine the cause of death many more people began to arrive with diarrhea and other muscle aches bernardo said
then many dead bodies from several neighborhoods were brought in which aroused our attention
authorities are still trying to figure out what contaminated the batch of phombe that has poisoned so many people in the village of chitima
samples taken from a two hundred and ten liter drum of the brew have been sent to a national laboratory for tests radio mozambique reported
most of the bodies have been buried in a cemetery in chitima after a mass led by a bishop the radio station said
illicitly brewed liquor kills at least twenty five in india
a mass funeral was carried out because the morgue of the local hospital was too small to accommodate all the bodies and the situation was being made worse by the intense heat in the region the report said
provincial officials have descended on the village and the national health minister was reported to be heading there with a group of doctors to bolster the medical teams already on the ground
we are receiving support from all corners said bernado listing coffins and medicine among the key aid coming from authorities and nongovernmental groups

highlighting continued economic growth and rising living standard in two thousand and fourteen the chinese president entering the third year into his expected decade long reign said he wanted to click the like button for the country's one point three billion citizens whose support for officials at all levels made such achievements possible
xi who also heads the ruling communist party as well as the world's largest standing army promised deeper reform and the rule of law in the coming year comparing them to a bird's two wings
the ten minute prerecorded address ended on an appeal for world peace
while he hit all the right notes xi saved the most dramatic metaphors for his massive anti corruption campaign
the sixty one year old leader considered china's most powerful in decades reiterated his zero tolerance stance vowing to keep waving high the sword against corruption and fastening the cage of regulations
for a nation still largely ruled from behind closed doors however official pronouncements after a series of year end leadership meetings have offered better clues on xi's ambitions and priorities in two thousand and fifteen
in the last week of december xi presided over the gathering of the twenty five member politburo the communist party's elite decision making body
organizing cliques within the party to run personal businesses is absolutely not tolerated read a statement issued after the meeting while acknowledging the challenges in the ongoing fight against corruption a lightning rod for mass discontent
the past year has certainly seen xi break some powerful cliques involving an intricate web of officials cronies and tycoons as well as billions of dollars worth of bribes and deals
he took down former domestic security czar zhou yongkang likely soon to become the most senior chinese official ever to face corruption charges
general xu caihou once the military's second in command
and ling jihua a top aide to ex president hu jintao
state media have touted them as the three biggest tigers caught in xi's now two year old anti graft campaign with a stated goal of targeting both tigers and flies high and low ranking officials
while applauded by many ordinary citizens xi's ever wider dragnet has also attracted increasing scrutiny
the question remains to be whether xi is taking a page from chairman mao said longtime political analyst willy lam with the chinese university of hong kong noting the three fallen leaders were all considered to be xi's political opponents
starting with mao corruption has been used to take down enemies of the more powerful faction
for the sake of stability within the party lam predicted a moratorium on the hunt for big tigers anyone in the rank of a politburo member and above in the next few years

beijing's fight to root out corruption
other observers even detect the anti corruption campaign's ominous effect on the economy the world's second largest
china's economic success had relied on some very capable people who also happened to be corrupt because of the system said economist mao yushi one of the country's leading liberal voices
he pointed to the example of former railway minister liu zhijun who was often credited with turning the country's high speed rail network from nonexistent to the world's largest in a few years
liu received a suspended death sentence in two thousand and thirteen for corruption and abuse of power
now we're getting rid of all of them mao added
the new reality is that officials don't want kickbacks but also feel no incentive to get anything done
during a three day economic policy meeting in early december xi and other top officials acknowledged the prospect of slower growth in two thousand and fifteen probably still at an enviable rate of seven percents though according to most analysts
the leaders reaffirmed their commitment to more sustainable development including more green growth shortly before promulgating the country's toughest environmental laws in twenty five years

xi jinping's push to add chilli pepper to china's anti corruption drive
the rule of law has become an unlikely catchphrase in state media since late october when the communist leadership made it the theme of a major meeting and declared the importance of upholding the constitution that enshrines the respect for human rights
only if the communist party rules the country in line with the law will people's rights as the master of the nation be realized read a communiqu released after the gathering known as the fourth plenum
it's the rule of law with chinese characteristics said lam the hong kong analyst before pointing to the communist party agency in charge of corruption probes
the central commission for discipline inspection is a powerful example of the party operating outside the law the way it conducts its investigations
the existence of a secretive process based on party regulations instead of laws faced by accused communist officials has come to light in recent years amid reports of suspicious deaths of detainees in party investigators custody
several victims families have told cnn and other media that their loved ones were subject to lengthy detention and torture for refusing to admit wrongdoings

the xi jinping cipher

lawyers are not the only group feeling the squeeze from the authorities
one of the hottest topics across chinese cyberspace so far in two thousand and fifteen has been the case of vanishing cleavage in a hit television show called the empress of china
reflecting aesthetics in seventh century tang dynasty the historical drama depicting the life of the only woman who ruled china in her own right had featured ample female bosoms before being suddenly pulled off air in late december
when the series returned to air on new year's day viewers nationwide noticed crudely edited scenes in which women were only shown in close up shots to avoid revealing their chests
the show's creators probably should have seen this coming though after xi addressed a delegation of actors dancers and writers in beijing last october
underscoring the need for art to serve socialism and foster correct worldviews the president told the artists not to pursue commercial success at the expense of producing work with moral values
popularity should not necessitate vulgarity xi said
pure sensual entertainment does not equate spiritual elation
anybody associated with thought work or ideology or the image of china everything is being squeezed or tightened or limited said jeremy goldkorn a leading commentator on china's media landscape
i think this is connected to xi's idea of the new normal he added
these things are going to go on not just a cyclical campaign whether it's anti corruption or tightening up on media ideological issues
already signs were plenty throughout last year
universities and state run think tanks warned to toe the party line in their teaching and research civil rights groups forced to cancel most public events and google's popular gmail service completely blocked in china
all the worrying developments have only confirmed some observers grim view on xi's signature political campaign
fighting corruption is necessary offered economist mao
but it's a complex issue related to income education freedom of speech and the rule of law
without fundamental changes in these areas the campaign won't succeed in the long run
there were expectations that once he consolidated power he would launch far reaching reforms but the past two years has not been encouraging said analyst lam
the big question in two thousand and fifteen is
how will xi use his new found supreme power

mourners on tuesday remembered beloved sons and daughters who became terrorist targets in three attacks last week in france
they died at the hands of three islamist extremists who tried to use religion to justify their slaughter
he was killed by false muslims said malek merabet whose brother ahmed also a muslim was one of three french police officers killed in the attacks
one must not confuse extremists with muslims
mad people have neither color nor religion
french authorities on friday killed the three people directly behind the wave of terror
it began two days earlier with the massacre of twelve at the offices of the satirical charlie hebdo magazine
continued thursday with police officer clarissa jean philippe's slaying in the paris suburb of montrouge
and climaxed the next day with a hostage siege at a kosher grocery store that killed four
since then many around the globe have joined france in rallying against the islamist terror threat
that spirit was evident sunday in paris when world leaders joined an estimated one point five million people marching in defiance of the killers and in solidarity with one another
but if sunday was a day for unity tuesday was a day to grieve
that's what happened in jerusalem where israeli leaders joined thousands to remember the four victims of the eastern paris grocery store siege and to support their loved ones as they were buried

at a ceremony two thousand miles away in paris french president franois hollande posthumously gave the legion d'honneur to merabet jean philippe and franck brinsolaro laying medals on the coffins of all three slain police officers
merabet was buried later tuesday while the other two will be laid to rest in the coming days
they shared one desire
that of protecting their citizens hollande said
they had one ideal
that of serving the republic
they died in accomplishing their mission with courage with bravery with dignity
at tuesday's ceremony hollande spoke about the three officers individually as well as their shared profession and values
brinsolaro was a protection officer for charlie hebdo's editor stphane charbonnier who was also killed wednesday
he had become one of those policemen especially trained to ensure the safety the security of people who are particularly vulnerable hollande said
and jean philippe was responding to a traffic accident when she was killed by a gunman suspected in last week's terror attacks
she was cowardly shot in the back hollande said
how can one justify that one can kill so cowardly a young woman of twenty six years of age with all the future before her devoted to others 
hollande spoke of the wonderful future merabet had ahead of him before his horrific death which was caught on video with a gunman walking right up to him as he lay sprawled on the ground then opening fire
merabet was laid to rest at the bobigny islamic cemetery in a paris suburb after a brief ceremony
mourners applauded other police officers on hand and watched as merabet's coffin draped in a french flag was carried to the grave site
one target of the terrorists charlie hebdo the magazine will live on
there is a future said gerard briard the magazine's editor in chief but we don't know yet what it will resemble
there will be no interruption
in two weeks time there will be another edition of charlie hebdo
the publication known for its provocative jabs at religion politics society and more went to the presses tuesday for the first time since the attack
three million copies will be printed up from the usual sixty thousand in several languages including arabic
the issue will hit newsstands wednesday
this time the cover features a drawing of a frowning prophet mohammed with a teardrop coming from his eye
all is forgiven the cover headline says in french
charlie hebdo puts mohammed on its new cover
in the prophet's hands a sign says je suis charlie or i am charlie the phrase adopted around the world in protest of the attacks
the uk based ramadhan foundation condemned such depictions of mohammed as offensive to millions of muslims around the world
yet cartoonist renald luzier told reporters tuesday that the new edition's cover felt appropriate to him adding that he cried after finishing it
i'm sorry that i've drawn him again but the mohammed that we've drawn is above all a mohammed who is crying said luzier who goes by the pen name luz
muslims worldwide have condemned last week's attacks on charlie hebdo and elsewhere in france
but al qaeda in the islamic maghreb the terror group's north africa branch is threatening more of them according to a warning posted on jihadist websites
the group has battled french forces before in africa
many former french colonies are in that area with paris often coming to their support to fight against islamist militants
more than six thousand forces are involved in operations in and around africa according to defense ministry spokesman sacha mendel
france pays the cost of its violence on muslim countries and the violation of their sanctity the terror group said in a statement
as long as its soldiers occupy countries such as mali and central africa and bombard our people in syria and iraq and as long as its lame media continues to undermine our prophet france will expose itself to the worst and more
france's national assembly voted later tuesday to extend airstrikes against isis in iraq
but before doing so assembly members stood tall together proudly singing france's national anthem la marseillaise
among its lyrics these timely words
liberty cherished liberty fight alongside your defenders
that fight is happening inside france where mendel says there will be more than ten thousand french troops deployed by wednesday
and outside france the battle against isis and al qaeda is in full force in parts of the middle east and beyond
then there's the ongoing investigation and intelligence work aimed at preventing future attacks and learning more about the latest one
tracking down the assailants contacts is also a priority for authorities
a french citizen admitted in court tuesday that he knows one of the brothers blamed for the attack on charlie hebdo cnn affiliate tv seven bulgaria reported
bulgarian authorities first arrested fritz joly joachin near the country's border with turkey on a warrant for allegedly kidnapping his son
now he also faces terrorism charges and a french court has requested his extradition the bulgarian foreign ministry said tuesday
bulgarian public prosecutor darina slavova told agence france presse that the twenty nine year old joachin was in contact several times with charlie hebdo attacker cherif kouachi
according to afp the prosecutor said the charges against joachin are for participation in an organized crime group whose aim was organization of terrorist acts

the royal canadian mounted police announced monday that it had arrested suliman mohamed twenty one and charged him with participating in the activity of a terrorist group and conspiracy to participate in a terrorist activity
after making the arrest canada's national security team said in a statement that mohamed's arrest was directly linked to the arrests of ashton and carlos larmond two ottawa brothers accused of conspiring to commit terrorism offenses
the brothers were arrested friday
the rcmp alleged mohamed conspired to participate in terrorism with the larmond brothers
these recent arrests underscore the reality that there are individuals in ontario and in canada who have become radicalized to a violent ideology and who are willing to act upon it wrote chief superintendent jennifer strachan criminal operations officer for the ontario division of the rcmp
after an investigation dating back to at least august two thousand and fourteen the larmond brothers both twenty four were arrested friday in two different locations
ashton larmond was arrested in ottawa but his brother carlos was arrested at montreal's pierre elliott trudeau international airport where police said he was intending to travel overseas for terrorist purposes
carlos larmond was charged with participation in the activity of a terrorist group and with attempting to leave canada to participate in terrorist activity abroad a relatively new canadian terrorism law
through their lawyer the brothers indicated they would be fighting the charges
the rcmp statement did not give details of allegations against the suspects
i don't think we've been shown anything at this point said richard addelman the lawyer representing the larmonds
it was not clear monday night if mohamed had retained an attorney
canada's terrorism laws were amended in april two thousand and thirteen to include an offense for anyone leaving or attempting to leave canada for the purpose of committing a terrorist act abroad
very few canadians have been charged in this way and the outcome of this case will be closely watched by counterterrorism officials
it's going to be a significant case that's for sure added addelman
neighbors in an east ottawa neighborhood where mohamed has lived said they did not immediately recognize him but indicated there had been police activity on the street all weekend long

the fuselage or main body of the plane is believed to have been found by a ship scanning for wreckage northeast of where the tail section was previously discovered said supriyadi an operations coordinator at indonesia's national search and rescue agency who goes by only one name
but he said he hasn't seen the full report on the reported discovery yet and it hasn't been confirmed so far by the head of the search and rescue agency
the discovery of the fuselage would be a significant development as officials have suggested that many of the bodies of those on board the plane are likely to be found with it
forty eight bodies have so far been recovered from the sea some of them still strapped into seats
but more than one hundred remain missing
the overwhelming majority of the people on flight qz eight thousand five hundred and one were indonesian
there were also citizens of britain france malaysia singapore and south korea
on tuesday divers retrieved the cockpit voice recorder which is designed to retain all sounds on a plane's flight deck
the device is expected to help investigators understand what went wrong aboard flight qz eight thousand five hundred and one which went down in the java sea last month with one hundred and sixty two people aboard as it was headed toward singapore from the indonesian city of surabaya
on monday searchers recovered the plane's other key information source the flight data recorder which stores a vast amount of information about the aircraft's performance including air speed and cabin pressure
the flight data recorder tells investigators what happened on a plane but the cockpit voice recorder tells them why said mardjono siswosuwarno a senior official at indonesia's national transportation safety committee which is leading the investigation into the disaster
the why is mostly in there he said of the voice recorder which captures conversations between pilots as well as other sounds in the cockpit
the two flight recorders have been taken to a lab in jakarta the indonesian capital for analysis
investigators say they have successfully downloaded the contents of both devices
but mardjono cautioned that interpreting the information requires much more time
after the download investigators should have a pretty good idea within a couple of days of what happened aboard the plane mary schiavo a former inspector general of the u.s. department of transportation said this week
the flight data recorder usually contains hundreds of parameters and thousands of data points she said that look a bit like an electrocardiogram when they're printed
mardjono said he expected a preliminary report to be released within a month of the crash which happened december twenty eight
but it's unclear how much information the initial document will contain beyond what's already been made public
the final report containing investigators full conclusions will take months mardjono said
the agency's final report into adam air flight five hundred and seventy four which crashed in indonesian waters on new year's day two thousand and seven killing all one hundred and two people on board came out more than a year after that disaster
mardjono said the airasia plane's flight data recorder was in good condition after being pulled out of the water from under the debris of a wing monday
the recovery of the flight recorders took place after the plane's tail was lifted from the waves saturday
observers have suggested that the locations of the different parts of debris indicate the plane broke apart when it hit the water not when it was still at a high altitude
supriyadi the indonesian search official said monday that the debris patterns suggest the aircraft exploded on impact
but the country's transportation investigators said it was premature to say what had happened and one expert questioned the search official's choice of words
the word exploded i think maybe loses a little bit in translation said david soucie a former federal aviation administration safety inspector
i think really what he's meaning is a rupture from the impact itself
as with any hollow object hitting something very hard the pressure differential between the outside and the inside is very significant and it'll actually tear apart the aircraft on the top soucie said
that may be what he's referring to



the flogging friday in jeddah was the first of twenty such sessions imposed by a saudi court after badawi's two thousand and fourteen conviction
he was arrested after creating an online forum in two thousand and eight that his wife says was meant to encourage discussion about faith
raif raised his head towards the sky closing his eyes and arching his back amnesty international quoted what it said was an eyewitness to the flogging as saying
he was silent but you could tell from his face and his body that he was in real pain
the officer beat raif on his back and legs counting the lashes until they reached fifty
the punishment may also have been captured in cell phone video uploaded to youtube
in the unverified video a man in uniform can be seen striking a shackled prisoner with a cane as a crowd gathers around
some in the crowd cried out allahu akbar or god is great as the man was being flogged
badawi's wife ensaf haidar said the video was difficult to watch
it's a scene i can not describe
it was horrible she said from canada
every lash killed me
publicly lashing a peaceful activist merely for expressing his ideas sends an ugly message of intolerance human rights watch said over the weekend
said boumedouha amnesty international's deputy director for the middle east called for badawi's immediate release
raif badawi is a prisoner of conscience
his only crime was to exercise his right to freedom of expression by setting up a website for public discussion boumedouha said in a statement
u.s. officials have also called on saudi officials to withdraw the sentence and review badawi's case
the saudi arabian ministry of foreign affairs declined to comment to cnn on the case saying it was a legal issue not a political one
the flogging occurred days after saudi arabian officials condemned the terrorist attack on the french satire magazine charlie hebdo which has often lampooned islam
saudi officials said the attack was incompatible with islam

the british airways boeing seven hundred and seventy seven two hundred made the new york london route in five hours sixteen minutes last wednesday and reached ground speeds of up to one thousand two hundred km h riding a powerful jet stream of up to three hundred and twenty two km h tailwinds
the sonic barrier is broken at one thousand two hundred and twenty four km h
former ba pilot alastair rosenschein told the british press that riding the jet stream was just like surfing
it's extraordinary how fast you can go the daily telegraph quoted him as saying
you try to sit in the core of the jet where it's not too turbulent and where you can pick up some free mileage
it's not unusual to get one hundred mph tailwinds but have got more than that
this must be a record
several other flights heading east over the atlantic also benefited from the weather but it was flight ba one hundred and fourteen that made headlines with the record time
only the now retired concorde which was operated by ba and air france until it was decommissioned in two thousand and three bested flight one hundred and fourteen's new york london time a ba concorde made that trip in one thousand nine hundred and ninety six in just under two hours fifty three minutes
for european passengers traveling westwards however the jet stream will mean longer than average flight times as planes need to battle powerful headwinds
gale force winds affected travel in the uk this week ahead of forecasted heavy snow

while working on the last supper leonardo da vinci regularly took off from painting for several hours at a time and seemed to be daydreaming aimlessly
urged by his patron the prior of santa maria delle grazie to work more continuously da vinci is reported to have replied immodestly but accurately the greatest geniuses sometimes accomplish more when they work less
tony schwartz be excellent at anything
in his one thousand nine hundred and thirty two classic essay in praise of idleness bertrand russell heralded a coming time when modern technology would bring shorter work hours and time for leisure to be enjoyed equally by everyone
work and leisure both would be delightful and the world would be the better for it
every person possessed of scientific curiosity will be able to indulge it and every painter will be able to paint without starving


above all there will be happiness and joy of life instead of frayed nerves weariness and dyspepsia
russell along with scholars like josef pieper author of leisure the basis of culture thought that it is in moments of leisure that civilization gets created
both were extraordinarily productive despite their call for what may today be seen as slacking
but they argued that it is only when we take the time to lift our noses from the grindstone and are not busy with the getting making and doing that ensures our survival that flights of imagination bursts of insight can lead to inventions like the wheel art philosophy literature scientific discoveries and innovation
at the turn of the twenty th century leisure time was the ultimate status symbol a way not only of conspicuously showing off your wealth but of your ability to enjoy the best that life had to offer
even those without wealth in the labor movement sought a living wage and shorter work hours so they could as a famous protest song of the time put it not only have their bread but the time to enjoy the roses the fruits of their labor
ironically it was only when henry ford took the wildly controversial step of shuttering his automobile manufacturing factories on saturday and cutting daily work hours from the then standard twelve to eight that workers began not only enjoying leisure time at home but became more efficient and productive at work
though his fellow captains of industry screamed in protest ford had based the decision on his own in house research of how far he could push manual laborers before they became so exhausted or resentful that they'd begin making costly mistakes
within a few years the ford way became the industry standard and thus was born the forty hour work week
economists too began making rosy predictions of a coming age of abundant leisure
keynes thought that by two thousand and thirty we'd be working a fifteen hour work week and all would have time to enjoy the hour and the day virtuously and well
others predicted a twenty two hour work week six month work year or a standard retirement age of thirty eight
if anything thinkers at the time worried about what the masses would do to occupy themselves with so much free time on their hands
the predictions seem ludicrous now
in the united states white collar workers work longer and more extreme hours than their peers in just about any other advanced economy save south korea where the wall street journal has reported overworked koreans are checking themselves into prison like meditation retreats just to get away from it all and japan where they've even coined a word for death from overwork
karoshi
workers in the united states give up among the most vacation days
we are the only advanced economy with no national vacation policy
and technology has enabled not just flexible work but for work to seep into every corner every hour and every minute of the day
the forty hour work week of ford's legacy can seem like a cruel dream the labor policy that later enshrined it the one thousand nine hundred and thirty eight fair labor standards act now perversely gives businesses incentive to work salaried workers to the point of burnout and to keep hourly workers hours artificially low to avoid paying benefits or overtime
salaried workers have too little leisure time that they can choose and control what leisure scholars say is the essence of pure leisure
and hourly workers too much
though without either choice or control those blank unfilled hours of insecurity and gnawing anxiety can hardly be called leisure
just as with income inequality our experience of work and leisure is increasingly diverging
as millions of americans remained sidelined from the economy working far less than they'd like and for a minimum wage that in no major city in the country could cover the cost of a two bedroom apartment others wear long work hours like a badge of honor
economists have found that our workplaces reward employees by how long they sit at their desks in the office not for what they do
leisure is seen as unproductive at best and frivolous or a waste of time at worst
and that's not just stupid it's dangerous
we need to build an economy that creates enough work at fair wages for everyone
and we need to recapture our lost leisure
those two aspirations can work together
in a knowledge economy our strength comes from the power of our ideas
and we are wired for those ideas and inspiration to hit in quiet moments of leisure
psychologists john kounios and mark beeman have mapped brain waves and found the a ha moment comes in a calm relaxed state when we are doing anything but work like when physicist richard feynman idly watched students goofing off spinning plates in the cafeteria and began making calculations of the wobbles for the fun of it which led to his developing the feynman diagrams to explain quantum electrodynamics and ultimately resulted in his nobel prize
neuroscience is finding that when we are idle in leisure our brains are most active the default mode network lights up which like airport hubs connect parts of our brain that don't typically communicate
so a stray thought a random memory an image can combine in novel ways to produce novel ideas
anders ericsson studied elite musicians at the berlin academy of music and is credited with the now wildly popular notion that it takes ten thousand hours of deliberate practice to master anything
but the key that separated the truly great from the good and the adequate was the way they spent those ten thousand hours
they practiced intensely first thing in the morning when they were freshest for no more than sixty to ninety minutes at a time and they rested more
in other words like brain waves like heart beats they worked in short bursts and recovered in leisure and became excellent at what they did
but perhaps the most compelling case for leisure is this
despite our overwork culture we have a lot of butt in chair presenteeism sick unhappy burned out and disengaged workers
we work long hours but we do not necessarily work productive efficient or creative hours
some years international comparisons of gdp per hours worked have found workers in norway ireland denmark and even france with their thirty days of paid vacation every year their caf culture their generous paid family leave policies their short work hours mandated by law and their new directive forbidding some employers from expecting workers to check work related texts and emails after hours beat us by a mile
as we think about the next american economy we need to consider policies as well as cultural shifts that respect that people need time especially relaxed and personal time every bit as much as they need money
by dialing down on overwork by once again matching wages which have been stagnating to productivity which has been rising we might not only be able to create more work for those who need it and work smarter but foster the creativity and innovation that will lead to a more dynamic productive economy and a better life
after all isn't the pursuit of happiness part of what defines us as americans 

award winning photographer peter turnley was at the unity rally in paris which has been called the largest mass gathering in france's history

editor's note
aaron david miller is a vice president and distinguished scholar at the woodrow wilson international center for scholars and was a middle east negotiator in democratic and republican administrations
follow him on twitter
the views expressed are his own
secretary of state john kerry will visit paris later this week but that the administration could have been so tone deaf in missing a this weekend's chance to highlight its concerns over an issue critical to europe and america's own security is a stunning oversight
it suggests an inability to see the paris attacks in their proper perspective although doing so is admittedly no easy matter only days afterward
as washington and others process those events there are takeaways that should guide their thinking in the period ahead
they include
the jihadis aren't taking over the world
after nine eleven many had an overriding sense that more successful attacks would follow
they didn't
in fact both in europe and the u.s. it's stunning how few successful attacks directed by foreign terrorist organizations there have been
last year there were seventeen thousand nine hundred and fifty eight global fatalities to terror according to the university of maryland's global terrorism database
among them there were sixteen americans
almost eighty two percents of the terrorist attacks happened in only five countries
pakistan iraq syria yemen and afghanistan
terrorism emerging from the arab and muslim world along with weapons of mass destruction may well be to the twenty one st century what the cold war was to last century
the international community's defining national security challenge
just look what else occurred over the past week or so
two thousand people were killed by boko haram's savagery
there's no winning the battle against jihadi terror or ultimately defeating it
a perfect storm of jihadi fantasies driven by hatred and triumphalism and growing shia sunni divisions have combined with a dysfunctional arab world that offers up either no governance or bad governance
and this will continue to produce alienation radicalization and violence
the war on jihadi terrorism really is a war
but of a generational character
it will be with us for years to come
we can contain preempt and try to prevent it
but we can not hermetically seal our borders or eliminate our vulnerability without undermining and sacrificing our freedoms and way of life
the outpouring of goodwill and solidarity that has followed the paris attacks is an encouraging sign
and if it leads to greater international resolve more effective security cooperation smart counter terrorism and an effort in france and in europe to reduce discrimination against muslims and promote greater acceptance of jews it will help contain the jihadi threat
but you don't change a nation in a single traumatic act
nine eleven didn't do it
newtown didn't
ferguson didn't
and the paris attacks won't either
anti muslim and anti immigration sentiment along with the rise of the far right has been developing for years
a new tolerance won't come easy
ironically the same democratic values and freedom of expression and movement that the west defends will be used by jihadis and the alienated muslim communities on which they feed to sustain their radical effort
don't let muslims and arabs off the hook
arab governments the arab league the head of al azhar university in cairo and various muslim clerics have issued statements denouncing the paris attacks and various arab and muslim leaders attended yesterday's national rally in paris
all of this is important
but let's be clear
for far too long a disturbing minority of arabs and muslims have hijacked a religion in the service of a radical jihad
and as they did this too many other muslims have been passive silent and acquiescent failing to condemn them and thus allowing them latitude to operate
arab governments have sometimes repressed jihadi ideology but other times as in the case of saudi arabia itself a victim of terror tried to accommodate it
or both
meanwhile anti semitic cartoons and tropes routinely circulate in the arab and muslim press
there is an ongoing struggle within islam between sunni and shia moderates and radicals modernists and traditionalists that is far from being resolved
islam's reformation is nowhere near at hand
and until there is a clearer separation between religion and the state better governance respect for freedom of expression and freedom of conscience and genuine tolerance and regard for minority rights radicalism will flourish
no u.s. narrative or externally generated reform effort can delegitimize the jihadis
only the muslims themselves can do that
the failures of arab and muslim governments are to blame for jihadi terror
but there's no doubt that western policies and practices have made an already bad situation worse
it is the cruelest of ironies that the u.s. the victim of mass terror on nine eleven helped enable the jihadis further with its ill considered and unwise invasion of iraq
one result was the creation of al qaeda in iraq
anger toward the west runs deep in this broken and dysfunctional region
u.s. relationships with allies such as saudi arabia and israel feed the jihadi narrative as do effective counterterrorism methods such as drone strikes that that kill innocents and often and alienate the mainstream muslims as well
whatever else we try to achieve in this broken angry and dysfunctional region our overriding goal must be to prevent attacks on the u.s. and help our allies do the same
what happened in paris is a tragic reminder of how challenging this will be

the twenty nine year old was voted best player in the world ahead of the argentina and barcelona forward and german international and bayern munich goalkeeper manuel neuer at a fifa ceremony held in zurich switzerland
ronaldo received the most votes from a panel made up of captains and coaches of national teams and a selection of the world's media
i would like to thank all of those who voted for me ronaldo said after receiving the award
it has been an incredible year
i would like to continue the work that i have done so far
i want to try to improve to become better as each day goes by
i never thought that i would bring this trophy back home on three occasions
i want to become one of the greatest players of all time
ronaldo who picked up his first world player of the year award in two thousand and eight and repeated the feat in two thousand and thirteen was hotly tipped to scoop the title for the third time after completing another spectacular season at real madrid
the portuguese scored fifty six goals in fifty one appearances for los blancos in all competitions in two thousand and fourteen and netted a total of sixty one goals from sixty appearances during the calendar year
he was instrumental in helping carlo ancelotti's side lift a ten th uefa champions league title as well as winning the copa del rey and the uefa super cup
ronaldo also broke the record for most la liga hat tricks in december last year
his three goals against celta vigo took him to a total of twenty three hat tricks one more than la liga legend telmo zarra and real madrid icon alfredo di stefano
in the same match he also notched up his two hundred th la liga goal
the portuguese has enjoyed a remarkable la liga season so far scoring twenty six times in seventeen matches for table topping real madrid this term
messi who won the fifa award for four consecutive years from two thousand and nine to two thousand and twelve admitted in an interview at the weekend that it would be difficult to win this year when ronaldo and neuer had enjoyed such success in two thousand and fourteen the german was a key member of country's world cup winning side in brazil and conceded just forty goals in sixty two matches all year
if nothing else the trip to zurich was a welcome distraction from speculation about his future at barcelona
rumors have circulated recently that the argentine is unhappy at the nou camp messi was recently left out of the starting line up in a la liga match against real sociedad and missed a training session the following day with a stomach bug
reports have suggested that he is unhappy with manager luis enrique's coaching methods and is seeking suitors in the english premier league
but he was quick to dismiss any idea of a move
speaking to barcelona tv after the catalan club's three one win against atletico madrid messi said suggestions that he wanted to leave the spanish giants were lies
i haven't asked for anything to stay here because i have never wanted to go anywhere else
i have also heard that i have spoken to chelsea and manchester city.but it's all lies messi told the spanish club's tv channel
stories circulating that he had poor relationships with former coach pep guardiola former star players including samuel eto'o and zlatan ibrahimovic and asked for them to be moved on were in no way true he said
i am tired of hearing things about me
they say that i run the club when i am just another player
i don't make those decisions nor have i asked to make them
however at the awards ceremony messi sent the rumor mill turning when he admitted
i don't know where i'll be next year
he added
i always said that i would finish my career at barcelona and then at newell's 
as cristiano said recently football has many twists and anything can happen
a number of other awards were given out during the star studded ceremony including the world coach of the year which went to the man who masterminded germany's world cup win last july joachim low
it is the icing on the cake the cake being the world cup low said
i know this award is not just for me i am taking it here on behalf of all those who have assisted
we have had excellent conditions to produce what we have been able to produce
it's a consequence of many years of hard work
i'd like to say thank you to all of the german coaches who do so much with the young players every day
the award for the women's world player of the year went to german midfielder nadine kessler who beat brazil striker marta and abby wambach the u.s. team's all time leading goalscorer to the title
kessler succeeds her compatriot nadine angerer who became the first goalkeeper to win the award twelve months ago
james rodriguez's sensational volley at the two thousand and fourteen world cup won the fifa puskas award for the best goal of two thousand and fourteen
the twenty three year old netted his goal during colombia's two zero win against south american rivals uruguay in the last sixteen
it was one of six goals rodriguez scored during the tournament a total that earned him the coveted golden boot award given to the player who scores most goals at a world cup finals
i'd like to thank everybody who has voted for me
this was a very special moment for me and everyone in colombia
i feel incredibly happy
rodriguez's goal scored in front thousands of spectators at the maracana stadium in rio and watched by millions on television pipped stephanie roche's volley
roche's spectacular goal was witnessed by an altogether smaller audience just ninety five people were at peamount's national league game against wexford youths
even so roche's effort beat robin van persie's flying header scored for holland against spain in the world cup into third

editor's note
j. peter pham is director of the atlantic council's africa center
the views expressed are his own
the blasts which killed three people besides the bombers and injured forty six more came just a day after another bomb strapped to a girl described by witnesses as about ten years old exploded in a busy market in the city of maiduguri killing at least twenty people
while coming in widely divergent settings thousands of miles apart the attacks in france and nigeria were both motivated by an islamist extremist ideology that rejects a modern world shaped by political economic and social liberalism and in the case of boko haram whose name can be roughly translated as education is forbidden also abhors scientific progress
to achieve this end no deed is too brutal or tactic too low as is underscored both by the recent actions of boko haram and the posthumously posted video by the gunman who killed four hostages in a kosher grocery store near paris
the difference has been that while there has been an outpouring of solidarity for the french victims and pledges of international solidarity for france's stand against violent extremism nothing similar has been forthcoming for nigeria's fight against the growing power of boko haram at least not since the ephemeral and largely ineffectual global social media phenomenon of the bringbackourgirls campaign last year
this is despite the fact that over the course of recent months boko haram has proven itself to be as much of a threat to international peace and security as the so called islamic state of iraq and syria which has received so much attention
in fact as jamestown foundation terrorism analyst jacob zenn has pointed out boko haram's videos show a troubling convergence between the nigerian militants and their isis counterparts not only in terms of symbolism and ideology but also insurgency doctrine
boko haram leader abubakar shekau for example first expressed support for the isis caliph abu bakr al baghdadi this past summer
meanwhile boko haram has added the jihadist black banner to its logo and the isis anthem to the musical repertoire on its videos
in one recent video shekau even seemed to declare that he is establishing his own islamic caliphate and greeted his brothers in afghanistan pakistan somalia and yemen as well as the caliphate in iraq and syria
even more worrisome than boko haram's extremist ideology and gruesome terrorist acts should be the increasing military sophistication demonstrated by the nigerian militants
alas while it is largely ignored by american and european leaders and only sporadically covered by major media outlets boko haram has been steadily gaining ground in its war against nigeria
as i wrote several months ago boko haram has like isis clearly moved beyond one off asymmetric attacks to sophisticated military operations resulting in the assimilation of increasingly large chunks of territory successfully overrunning and now effectively controlling large portions of three states in northeastern nigeria by some estimates a total area larger than the netherlands belgium and luxembourg combined
boko haram's territorial base has been used by the group as a staging ground for what has become a steady campaign of terrorist attacks like the past weekend's suicide bombings which regularly hit more than half a dozen other nigerian states as well as neighboring countries like niger many of which are already under significant pressure from militants linked to al qaeda's north african affiliate
niger's president mahamadou issoufou has even gone so far as to declare to the newsmagazine jeune afrique that the islamic state is at our door
by some estimates more than ten thousand people in nigeria alone have died as a result of boko haram related violence in two thousand and fourteen while more than one point five million others have been displaced
just last week the militants stormed baga on the shores of lake chad one of the last towns in the region remaining in government hands reportedly killing more than two thousand civilians
moreover the militants are showing increasingly advanced conventional military capabilities in contrast with the demoralized nigerian military forces they square off against
in early september for example the group shot down a nigerian attack jet that was operating against it and captured the pilot whom it later apparently beheaded according to a video obtained by the associated press
what makes the threat from boko haram all the more significant is the political and economic context of nigeria africa's most populous country and the largest economy on the continent
the west african country is in the midst of a hotly contested general election including a rematch presidential race between incumbent president goodluck jonathan and former military ruler muhammadu buhari with votes to be cast just a month from now
no doubt boko haram which rejects democratic politics along with other infidel ideas will take advantage of the campaign and voting process to step up attacks
it is hard to imagine how the threat could not have an impact on the vote
in paris on sunday police and military forces fanned out across the french capital meaning there was a reasonable sense of safety for marchers
in nigeria even if the country deployed every last soldier and policeman it would barely be able to put one security officer at each of its polling stations
and as if this were not bad enough declining oil prices have slashed nigerian government revenues substantially diminishing the resources available to defeat the extremists in battle and win the subsequent peace with social and economic development of an area whose long running marginalization helped give rise to the insurgency in the first place
it does of course go without saying that both the nigerian political class and its military with all their attendant pathologies bear responsibility for the dire situation the country finds itself in
but that fact alone should not absolve the international community of its obligation in helping to tackle the growing threat posed by boko haram any more than legitimate concerns about generally lackluster leadership by french president franois hollande and the french political elite's failure to deal squarely with the potential for radicalization among segments of the country's marginalized muslim population prevented world leaders from showing their support for france in recent days
as the roman catholic archbishop of jos nigeria pleaded on the bbc recently we need that spirit to be spread around.not just when it happens in europe but when it happens in nigeria in cameroon
in the struggle against islamist extremism and for peaceful coexistence and progress it is time the international community recognized there is no place for a tale of two cities

on december twenty nine pauline cafferkey thirty nine of glasgow scotland became the first person to be diagnosed with the virus on uk soil shortly after returning from sierra leone
on january three london's royal free hospital said cafferkey's condition had deteriorated to critical
but in a statement monday the hospital updated her condition
the royal free hospital is pleased to announce that pauline cafferkey is showing signs of improvement and is no longer critically ill it said
she remains in isolation as she receives specialist care for the ebola virus
on december thirty one the hospital said cafferkey had decided to have a blood plasma treatment using plasma from ebola survivors and to take an experimental antiviral drug
the royal free is equipped with a high level isolation unit where access is restricted to specially trained medical staff
a specially designed tent with controlled ventilation covers the patient's bed
cafferkey had been working at save the children's kerry town ebola treatment center in sierra leone for six weeks before she returned to glasgow via casablanca and london heathrow airports
last week save the children said it was doing everything possible to establish how cafferkey contracted ebola and had been conducting a review since she was confirmed as having the virus

all are sites that suffered attacks committed by muslim extremists in recent months
expand the time frame and the list lengthens
even as the vast majority of muslims condemn terrorism the frequency and cruelty of the assaults have led many people to ask tough questions about the faith
here are some that seem to be on a lot of minds
many muslims bristle at mere hint of this idea noting that there are one point six billion muslims in the world most of whom live peaceful and productive lives
here's how muslim human rights lawyer arsalan iftikhar responded on cnn after the attack that killed twelve in paris on wednesday
cnn is not the only news outlet raising this question by the way
the new york times explored the link between islam and violence in a front page article on thursday
iftikhar and other muslims note that almost every faith from christianity to judaism to hinduism to buddhism has produced acts of terrorism
think about it this way
if you were a jew during the inquisition in spain would you think that christianity is inherently violent 
scholars say there is rarely a direct link between religious beliefs and violent behavior
instead terrorism is generally caused by a complex web of factors
but there's no escaping this fact
the number of attacks committed by self proclaimed muslims has risen sharply in recent years
those attacks have led some critics to argue that islam is inherently violent
to make their case they point to the sword verse in the quran as exhibit a
here's what the verse says
then when the sacred months are drawn away slay the idolaters wherever you find them and take them and confine them and lie in wait for them at every place of ambush
but if they repent and perform the prayer and pay the alms then let them go their way
raymond ibrahim an author and frequent critic of islam argues that based largely on that verse islam's learned officials sheikhs muftis and imams throughout the ages have all reached consensus binding on the entire muslim community that islam is to be at perpetual war with the non muslim world until the former subsumes the latter
many muslims scoff at that argument noting that the vast majority of muslims are clearly not warring with other religions
but this verse has been exploited by extremist groups like isis who say that muslims have a sacred duty to kill the disbelievers
mainstream muslim leader accuse both islam's critics and extremists of ripping the sword verse from its historical context
this verse can not be taken as a carte blanche execution order on all non muslims yasir qadhi a conservative muslim american cleric explained in a lecture in memphis last month
the quranic passage applies only to pagans in islam's arabian birthplace he said
there's no sugar coating it it's a threat said qadhi who has a large following in the united states
it was meant to scare people and that's why paganism disappeared from the arabian peninsula
two
why have there been so many recent attacks by extremist muslims 
there's no single answer
instead experts say there are a range of reasons from personal motives to global movements from ancient doctrines to modern technology
take for example the two suspects in the paris terrorist attack that killed twelve this week cherif kouachi thirty two and his brother said thirty four
both were killed by french police after an intense manhunt on friday
according to french media the men massacred journalists at charlie hebdo a satirical magazine to avenge the prophet mohammed a revered figure in islam
but the brothers born in france to algerian parents and orphaned at a young age weren't particularly religious growing up
cherif kouachi was more interested in smoking pot listening to hip hop and chasing girls according to french media
a brookings institution report paints a bleak picture of life for first generation french immigrants particularly from north africa
many live in neighborhoods suffering from extreme poverty welfare dependency black markets and broken families
nearly one in five don't have hot water at home the report found
muslims meanwhile often complain about being disrespected by france's largely secular culture
we don't yet know much about the kouachi brothers childhood but we do know that cherif kouachi eventually met a charismatic fellow french algerian farid benyettou who introduced him to a new culture and a new cause
the wise leaders in islam told and his friends that if they die as martyrs in jihad they would go to heaven kouachi said in french court documents
meanwhile kouachi watched images of the iraq war on television and became convinced that he should take up arms to defend fellow muslims against american troops
in two thousand and five he was arrested as he was about to travel to iraq
three years later kouachi was sentenced to three years in prison for being part of a jihadist recruitment ring in paris
less is known about said kouachi but french and u.s. authorities say evidence indicates that both brothers received military training from al qaeda in yemen a failed state that has become a breeding ground for terrorists
alienated or impoverished youths
charismatic radicals who exploit islamic teachings to recruit followers and lone wolf attackers over the internet
fantasies of revenge for perceived slights
easy access to lethal weapons
states too weak to kick out terrorists or plug the jihadist pipeline to places such as syria and yemen
none of these factors alone creates terrorists
they all do
three
how do many muslims feel right now 
this email from a longtime muslim american source sums up the sentiment
muslims can not get a break
every day there must be an event to suggest islam is inherently violent
such acts destroy years of goodwill and work about islam
compounding these feelings of frustration many muslims say is the implication that all muslims shoulder the blame for terroristic attacks or aren't doing enough to denounce them
daniel haqiqatjou of the website muslim matters wrote one of the wittiest responses to this idea on friday satirically suggesting that what muslims really need is an icondemn app
with the icondemn muslims can say not in my name at the speed of life
and non muslims no longer need to wonder whether one point six billion muslims around the world feel the guilt and sincerely apologize for that latest reprehensible crime some idiot carried out while shouting allahu akbar 
on a more serious note recent surveys show that large majorities of muslims around the world are increasingly concerned about islamic extremism
four
does islam really ban all images of the prophet mohammed 
there's nothing in the quran islam's primary text about depicting the prophet
but according to the hadith stories and sayings attributed to mohammed and his companions he did discourage muslims from making images of him
in some ways the prophet's prohibition was a reaction against the other religions circulating through islam's arabian birthplace
mohammed had seen some of those faiths make idols and gods of their prophets and messengers and wanted to ensure muslims attention would focus on god alone
many modern muslims follow that advice and several told cnn this week that they consider any images of mohammed to be blasphemous
still there is a rich historical tradition particularly in places such as persia and turkey of depicting the prophet says christiane gruber an expert in islamic art at the university of michigan
five
why is mohammed so important to muslims 
all religions revere their founding prophets but for many muslims mohammed is not just the messenger
he's an embodiment of the perfect believer and a symbol of the faith
i being a muslim may tolerate any offense that targets my character and personality muhammad qasim noor a saudi arabian teen told cnn on friday
however when the targeted personality is mohammad i shall never forgive that person
abed awad an expert in islamic law said that most law books equate criticism of mohammed in his role as a prophet with defaming god
other laws say that disparaging the prophet can sometimes be considered apostasy
but islamic tradition also emphasizes that mohammed was just a man as fallible as the next guy
one hadith tells the story of a man who asked mohammed for farming advice
the advice failed and the man returned to mohammed seeking an explanation
what do you want from me 
the prophet answered
i'm only human
just a day before the paris terrorist attack egyptian president abdel fattah el sisi urged muslim leaders to start a religious revolution
you imams are responsible before allah he told clerics at al azhar egypt's leading muslim institution
the entire world is waiting for your word
because the islamic world is being torn it is being destroyed it is being lost
and it is being lost by our own hands
because of his brutal human rights record rounding up dissidents jailing journalists and cracking down on the muslim brotherhood many muslims simply shrugged off al sisi's speech
but the idea of an islamic reformation has been building for more than a decade with some saying that it's already ongoing and others arguing that no two religions follow the same historical path
many muslim imams and intellectuals agree however that the religion needs to do some serious soul searching
we have lost so many of the core essentials of islam
mercy compassion knowledge patience good manners forbearance
and the list goes on and on qadhi the cleric from memphis said in a message posted on facebook on wednesday night
indeed it is truly sad our state of affairs
ed husain a senior adviser at the tony blair faith foundation summarized the situation more succinctly saying
the house of islam is on fire
seven
how can the extremists be stopped 
farah pandith a former special representative to muslim communities for the u.s. state department called extremism a generational problem
the jihadists aren't recruiting forty year olds she noted on friday
they're targeting young people who are besieged by conflicting media images and can move quickly from internet inflammation to real world actions
nearly sixty percents of muslims are under thirty pandith said so it's crucial for young muslims parents imams scholars artists and activists to muster virtual armies who can counter the extremist onslaught
how are isis and al qaeda building their armies 
they're building their armies with recruits pandith said
we have to stop the recruitment

the chocolate eggs filled with a cloying yolk of yellow and white fondant were originally made in the united kingdom with cadbury's signature dairy milk chocolate
now under the new recipe they're made with a standard traditional cadbury milk chocolate said a spokeswoman for mondelez international a spinoff of kraft foods in a statement
kraft acquired british candy maker cadbury in two thousand and ten for roughly nineteen billion dollar
the change applies only to cadbury eggs sold in the united kingdom
the goo filled eggs usually appear on shelves starting in january until april
we have always used a range of milk chocolate blends for different products depending on their shape or consistency the spokeswoman said
the fundamentals of the cadbury crme egg remain exactly the same delicious milk chocolate and the unique creme centre that consumers love
however fans aren't buying it
some took to twitter to vent their displeasure
according to cadbury five hundred million creme eggs are made each year and about two thirds of those are consumed in the uk
this is not cadbury's first controversy of two thousand and fifteen's creme egg season
fans expressed similar disappointment when the number of eggs in each pack was cut from six to five

it is the twelve th march in dresden called by the protest group patriotic europeans against the islamization of the west or pegida since october
dresden police say the number of people attending these rallies has increased from an estimated three hundred and fifty protesters on october twenty to eighteen thousand on january five and twenty five thousand people on monday
the pegida movement emerged last year in the eastern german city
about two percents of dresden's inhabitants are foreigners
on its facebook page pegida says citizens should wake from their slumber and recognize the danger in the islamic ideology
stop the radical salfists islamization it urges
as a society we should give people the chance to integrate but we should not allow ourselves to be islamized thereby losing our freedom and democracy
the group claims to have supporters in more than thirty german cities and eighteen countries in europe
a pegida group in norway has also called for demonstrators to gather outside the town hall in the capital oslo to show support for the french and demonstrate opposition to what it calls the islamification of norway
in dresden organizers earlier announced that monday's rally would commemorate the victims of last week's attacks in paris
critics however say that protesters are taking advantage of the attacks to attract supporters and incite hatred against refugees and foreigners
german justice minister heiko maas called upon the organizers to cancel the protests
in an interview with german newspaper bild he said the victims do not deserve to be abused by such agitators
the head of germany's csu party horst seehofer told ard television
i want to request those responsible
that they cancel their demonstrations for the foreseeable future especially at a time when the whole world is shocked about the events in paris
german chancellor angela merkel who has repeatedly voiced her disagreement with the pegida movement in recent weeks made similar demands
a representative for pegida in dresden told cnn that the march would not be canceled
they are putting us on the same level as radical extremists said kathrin oertel one of pegida's leaders
we have the right to express our condolences to the victims of friday's terror attack
oertel added
we all think we are being neglected by our politicians
she later told cnn that she does not want to be perceived as racist
muslims are only a tiny fraction of the population but they're so dominant in pushing for their demands that german culture is being pushed back said oertel
we want to live peacefully with all immigrants here in germany but we as germans demand that they assimilate themselves into our culture and that they live in accordance with our laws and don't build up parallel societies
at a planned protest in nearby leipzig organized by a group similar to pegida protest organizers had agreed to a city ban on showing anti mohammed cartoons but city authorities revoked their ban monday following criticism that it limited free speech
according to german wire service deutsche presse agentur leipzig city officials originally made the decision to ensure that the protests would remain peaceful
after paris one must assume that mohammed cartoons are meant to be a provocation dpa quoted a city representative before the ban was revoked
french cartoonists reacted to the german pegida marches by publishing caricatures in which they ridiculed the protesters
on saturday thirty five thousand people assembled in front of dresden's landmark site the frauenkirche to advocate for tolerance
local politicians emphasized that they were open for a dialogue with pegida protesters
counterprotests against anti islam demonstrators were planned in hanover dsseldorf hamburg munich dresden leipzig and berlin
on its facebook page the leftist group dresden nazifrei called upon its supporters to protest against the anti muslim demonstrators
the dresden nazifrei organizers wrote
it is your decision to decide whether there will only be protests in hearing range and sight distance or whether we will try to do more
large numbers of police officers will try to keep anti muslim protesters and their opponents from clashing with a heavier presence because of the paris attacks
we have slightly increased the number of police officers involved a police representative told cnn on monday refusing to give specific numbers ahead of the demonstration
later police said that around one thousand six hundred officers were involved on monday
some eight thousand seven hundred people protested against pegida in dresden according to police
a poll by german newspaper der spiegel in december found that thirty four percents of respondents believed their country was becoming increasingly islamicized
german interior minister thomas de maiziere told cnn's christiane amanpour last week that he was worried by this tendency but that the significance of the protests should not be overestimated
it's new it's concerning but we should not be dominated by pegida when we discuss our political agenda he said
on the other hand he said protesters posed some questions that needed to be answered
they ask
is there an end of asylum seekers how dangerous is islam for our society what about the fight against is can this be successful 
these critical questions have to be faced have to be answered de maziere said
but he said he did not fear a rise of ugly nationalism in germany again
i'm confident we are strong he said
we learned our lessons from the nazi years and you can see it's very interesting that the organizations of pegida
they know exactly where the red line is which they should not cross this makes me more skeptical but they know where the taboos are in germany so i don't see a renewal of the npd it's less than in other european countries
and we are very well aware of it and we will fight against every tendency
joerg forbrig a european analyst with the german marshall fund of the united states told cnn that the pegida movement had really only gained traction in the dresden area where its ideas had fallen on particularly fertile soil
these protests are not so much fueled by fear of islam and fear of islamist attacks but by frustration at the cost of reunification about the way they are being integrated and represented since the fall of the berlin wall forbrig said
dresden already had a well established network of right wing extremists before pegida's emergence he said
it's more a case of east germans not entirely feeling at home in germany forbrig said
there is a feeling of second class citizenship and in order to be heard many east germans take to radical measures
the movement was basically a plea for more attention more than anything else he said
i think this movement has peaked i don't think that there is much more of a local and regional potential that this movement can exploit
forbrig stressed that there was a substantial counterprotest movement with those protesters outnumbering pegida supporters last week in cologne by ten to one
in fact across germany on monday more than eighty thousand people protested against pegida according to the news agency dpa
in her new year's speech merkel addressed the issue of xenophobia saying such demonstrations encourage the exclusion of people because of their skin color or religion
merkel urged people not to attend such rallies where people have hatred in their hearts she said
we know the value of unity in our country she said
it is the foundation of our success

last month a china bound thai airasia flight was forced to return to bangkok after a female chinese passenger threw hot water on a flight attendant amid a heated argument between her boyfriend and the cabin crew over service
on saturday passengers on a plane departing kunming changshui international airport in southwestern china angry with the crew for turning off the air conditioning during the de icing process opened three emergency exits just as their plane was pushing back from the gate
the flight was canceled and twenty five passengers onboard were detained
china eastern airlines flight mu two thousand and thirty six bound for beijing was already seven hours behind schedule at three forty five a.m. when crew began to de ice the plane at the kunming airport which saw more than one hundred flights delayed or canceled that night because of snowy weather
frustrated by the lengthy delay some of the one hundred and fifty three passengers who had been sitting on the plane for two hours exploded with rage when the air conditioning stopped and an elderly passenger complained about discomfort due to the stuffy cabin airport police told state media saturday night
dissatisfied with the pilot's explanation about the need for air conditioning to be off during the thirty minute de icing process members of a tour group started quarreling with the crew according to police
when the boeing seven hundred and thirty seven eight hundred jet finally pushed back from the gate three of its four over the wing emergency exits suddenly popped open
photos circulating on social media show two opened exits on the right side of the cabin with passengers still seated as well as crews and police on board documenting evidence
after detaining and questioning all twenty five members of the tour group the authorities announced that a male member of the group prompted by a female tour guide opened two exits on the right side
both were sent to jail for fifteen days while police continued to look for the person who opened the exit on the left side
as news of the incident spread some chinese internet users sympathized with the perpetrators because of the delay but many considered their punishment too lenient and suggested airlines should blacklist them for life
air rage is a common sight in delay prone china and saturday's episode was not the first dramatic incident involving irate passengers at kunming airport
one of the country's busiest hubs more than thirty two million fliers passed through its terminal last year
in august two thousand and twelve thirty one passengers from a long delayed flight tried to stop other planes from leaving kunming by forcing their way onto the tarmac and occupying a taxiway for half an hour state run xinhua news agency reported
the following february some fifty passengers from a canceled flight stormed several gates at the airport in an attempt to prevent other travelers from boarding their flights
police had to disperse the angry crowd with pepper spray according to xinhua
with the exponential growth of outbound tourism chinese travelers now seem to be exporting their air rage overseas as well with several incidents resulting in flight delays or diversions recorded in recent years
in february two thousand and twelve a chinese couple was kicked off their united flight from guam to shanghai after they repeatedly yelled at a flight attendant and told her to shut up when she tried to move their luggage in the overhead bin to accommodate other passengers
in september that year a swiss flight bound for beijing was forced to return to zurich when a fight broke out between two chinese men over a reclined seat
in february two thousand and fourteen a fight erupted between two groups of chinese passengers before their flight could take off from the thai resort island of phuket resulting in twenty nine people being taken off the plane
then in april a thai airways red eye from bangkok to beijing turned bloody when a brawl involving three chinese men broke out
during an official visit to the maldives in september president xi jinping personally asked chinese tourists to behave themselves while traveling abroad
last year the government released a lengthy list of do's and don'ts aimed at turning chinese travelers into civilized tourists

it's very likely french prime minister manuel valls said
we are doing everything we can to dismantle what appears to be a network

no doubt there was complicity and networks and maybe finance also he told cnn's christiane amanpour
investigators are still trying to piece together who was behind the islamist terror attacks that killed seventeen people
clues have emerged tying the attackers to a man who was once al qaeda's top recruiter in europe and to training with al qaeda in the arabian peninsula in yemen
said and cherif kouachi blamed for wednesday's attack on charlie hebdo magazine are dead
so is amedy coulibaly who authorities say killed a police officer carried out an attack at a kosher market and might have shot a jogger
it's not clear how many people might have helped them plot last week's attacks
but valls said they couldn't have done it without help
i don't really believe in the idea of the lone wolf he said
a key player who could help unravel details is hayat boumeddiene coulibaly's partner and alleged accomplice
early reports said she was by his side during the hostage siege at the kosher market
but now investigators believe she was far from paris when the attacks unfolded
boumeddiene arrived in turkey from madrid on january two five days before the first attack in paris turkey's anadolu news agency reports
boumeddiene stayed at an istanbul hotel and then traveled to syria on thursday andalou said
the last place authorities spotted boumeddiene was somewhere near turkey's border with syria
police have searched an apartment outside paris as they try to track her down
there investigators discovered isis flags automatic weapons and detonators at an apartment rented out by coulibaly boumeddiene's partner and suspected co conspirator france's rtl radio reported citing authorities
authorities are looking into whether boumeddiene helped prepare the attacks before leaving france valls told cnn
and there's another concern a u.s. intelligence official told cnn
now that she is believed to have escaped to syria boumeddiene could be used in propaganda videos to gloat about the attacks
france was on its highest alert level monday as people went back to work and children returned to schools following the attacks
at least ten thousand soldiers and eight thousand police officers will be deployed across the country french media reported
we must remain vigilant because the threat is still very much present valls told cnn affiliate bfmtv
about four thousand seven hundred officers will be tasked with securing seven hundred and seventeen jewish schools valls said
four of the victims were killed friday at the kosher market the latest in a string of anti semitic attacks that have led many jewish families to leave the country
a muslim employee is credited with helping hide some hostages in a walk in freezer which he turned off
a photo from the freezer shows a baby was among the hostages
the situation can only get worse
it does not look like the problem is going away high school student gary uzan seventeen told cnn on monday
i will go to israel
it is better for us
it is safer
the wife of cherif kouachi has condemned her husband's actions
she condemns every violent act her attorney christian saint palais said in a statement
she was astonished when she learned her husband was involved in the charlie hebdo attack
the statement which did not include the wife's name expressed her sympathies for the families of the victims
some three point seven million people marched in anti terrorism rallies sunday across france including one point five million in paris
about forty world leaders joined in the march in the french capital
police said no incidents had been reported despite the record number of people involved in the paris rally
still french law enforcement officers have been told to erase their social media presence and carry weapons at all times because terror sleeper cells have been activated in the country a police source said
investigators are looking into whether the attackers last week were part of a larger cell and if so when it may strike again valls told cnn's christiane amanpour
the threats go well beyond france
the new york city police department and other u.s. law enforcement agencies responded to a threat from isis after someone released again a september message that tells followers to rise up and kill intelligence officers police officers soldiers and civilians specifically naming the united states france australia and canada as targets
according to a new york police memo obtained by cnn department employees were told to remain alert and consider tactics at all times while on patrol especially in light of the attacks in france last week
the fbi and department of homeland security issued a similar bulletin to law enforcement across the united states
in a statement monday u.s. secretary of homeland security jeh johnson said the transportation security administration is increasing the number of random searches of passengers and carry on luggage at u.s. airports
johnson said his agency had implemented new measures including stepped up efforts to share information about terrorist threats and individuals of suspicion with france and other key counterterrorism allies and to boost security outside u.s. government buildings
early sunday a firebomb was hurled at a german newspaper that reprinted charlie hebdo cartoons depicting the prophet mohammed though authorities haven't said whether the arson attack was connected to the charlie hebdo massacre
no one was injured in the attack




the police estimate differed from the local hospital's estimate which counted fifty one people with blast injuries
the blast happened at the main entrance of the ever crowded monday market the largest in the city of maiduguri
about twelve forty p.m. saturday the girl was stopped for screening by vigilantes who man the gates of the market according to witnesses and rescuers
the girl was among the dead said gideon jubril borno state's police spokesman
her precise age was not immediately clear
a source with inside knowledge of security operations described her as being about seventeen or eighteen
abur babakura who was at the scene said she appeared to be about ten
the explosives detonated as the girl was being screened with a metal detector at the market's entrance he said
it's standard procedure for people to be screened before entering the market
although no one has claimed responsibility boko haram militants are the main suspects
this was the fourth attack on the city's market since july
the metal detector beeped indicating she was carrying a metal under her dress but it exploded before she could be singled out from the crowd said babakura
we believe that
an accomplice watching from a distance pressed the remote he said
two of the vigilantes manning the entrance were among the dead babakura said
the source reported that at least six vigilantes were killed
many of wounded victims taken to maiduguri specialist hospital have life threatening injuries said musa kyarimi a nurse there
the marketplace in maiduguri has been a frequent target
more than forty five people were killed in late november in an attack and more than ten others died in another blast a week later on december one
another bombing on july one left at least fifteen people dead and several injured
on sunday three people were killed and forty three injured in a separate attack in potiskum police said
two female suicide bombers targeted the mobile phone market in potiskum this afternoon but they blew up before the could reach their targets marcus danladi police commissioner for yobe state said from the state capital of damaturu
the two bombers were also killed
boko haram has terrorized northern nigeria since two thousand and nine attacking police schools churches and civilians and bombing government buildings
it also has kidnapped students including more than two hundred schoolgirls who were abducted in april and remain missing
according to the source the group is attacking villages killing older men and women and rounding up the young to do their dirty work or to be used as bombers
maiduguri is the capital of borno state
the deadly saturday blast came after a bloody massacre in baga a fishing town about one hundred and twenty five miles away where boko haram militants killed hundreds possibly as many as two thousand people
that massacre has been described as boko haram's deadliest act by amnesty international
the islamist group whose name translates to western education is sin has said its aim is to impose a stricter form of sharia law across nigeria which is split between a majority muslim north and a mostly christian south

the rips in the so called intelligence net reveal gaps that led directly to the tragic events that have gripped paris and the rest of france for days and also raise serious security concerns for the future here and abroad more than a half dozen experts on security and terrorism told cnn
and it couldn't come at a worse time
the brazen murders of seventeen innocent people in three separate attacks in as many days has led to a fabled city shaken shocked and in mourning
the new concerns raise the serious possibility that national security and surveillance of suspected terrorists in france will need to be increased or totally reviewed and revamped to provide better safety for the nation as a whole some experts told cnn
and with one of the suspected terrorists still on the loose of as sunday night and new reports of sleeper cells being activated the security concerns are only amplified
on saturday french police were told in a briefing that sleeper cells have been activated over the past twenty four hours inside france terror expert samuel laurent said he had been told by a police source
he said officers were told to erase all visible online presence on social media and keep their weapons on themselves at all times he said
there is a huge security failure those people were all considered as extremely dangerous said laurent a french expert who has written several books on terror groups their actions and jihadism
they were all supposed to be monitored
in the u.s. they were on a no fly list
so we can ask the question whether the u.s. is more able to monitor french jihadis on french territory than the french intelligence itself said laurent
one of the most common complaints heard by experts
simple math showing aspiring terrorists in france having the upper hand
one former director of a french counterterrorism unit put it in these terms
there are far too many of them and far too few of us he said asking to speak anonymously because he did not have permission to speak to reporters
we can not possibly keep track of them all and we are seriously outnumbered he said
two other former french terrorist officials agreed
jean charles brisard head of the french center for analysis of terrorism put it like this
to put someone under surveillance you need two things
you need a good reason you need to believe someone is going to be radicalized that someone is going to become violent
the second thing you need is resources
you need twenty five agents
to survey them physically his phone his laptops ipads whatever
it is virtually impossible to put surveillance on three thousand to five thousand people in france who we know now are radicalized he said
beyond concerns about the state of simple surveillance experts point out other issues in the fight against terrorism
they're worried about the proliferation of jihadi videos on social media the growth of radical jihadi preaching and the relative ease with which citizens of france can get into turkey and across the syrian border
the week of terror began at the offices of charlie hebdo where twelve journalists and others were murdered in close quarters leaving a gruesome and violent crime scene behind the likes of which paris has not seen in years
the attackers were two brothers who were well known to authorities and who would seemingly call out for increased surveillance and scrutiny
cherif and said kouachi were orphans and had criminal records
the younger brother cherif was actually prosecuted and jailed for his ties to a jihadist recruitment ring in the northeast quadrant of paris
the ring known by name for a park where they met the buttes chaumont was recruiting young disaffected parisian muslims to join in the iraq war as jihadis against american forces
three of the young recruits wound up in falluja where american forces died in numerous fierce battles
cherif kouachi was arrested in two thousand and five when he was about to leave for iraq
he was sentenced to three years in prison in two thousand and eight
but cherif didn't serve any time after the conviction the judge ruled that his pretrial detention had been enough
still his radicalization was well known to officials spelled out in detailed court documents back in two thousand and seven
the documents obtained in conjunction with l'express show cherif had a long history of jihadist aspirations including going to iraq to combat the americans for the injustices they had inflicted on iraqis
in two thousand and ten cherif was connected with a foiled plot to help a convicted terrorist escape from jail though there was not enough evidence to send him back to jail
during his stint behind bars cherif met djamel beghal a jihadi who was jailed for plotting to bomb the u.s. embassy in paris
beghal a known al qaeda recruiter was also connected to amedy coulibaly who died the same day as the two brothers after he killed several hostages at a kosher grocery store in eastern paris
at times before and after his stint in jail cherif kouachi was under surveillance by french authorities
but several former top french government officials told cnn he had dropped off priority lists this past summer and was less carefully monitored
cherif's older brother said traveled to yemen in two thousand and eleven according to a u.s. official for three or more months and is believed to have trained with al qaeda while he was there
coulibaly was also known by french authorities
he too had a criminal past with jihadi links
like cherif he was connected to the plot to free a convicted terrorist from jail
a western intelligence source told cnn that coulibaly was arrested in connection with the plot known as belkacem project in may of two thousand and ten
he was in possession of two hundred and forty rounds of ammo for a kalishnikov
while he was awaiting trial for the foiled plot cherif visited coulibaly according to the western intelligence source
despite all these well known links to terror concerns and even the links between coulibaly and cherif all three attackers seem to have largely dropped from french surveillance priorities up to the moment they were linked to the ongoing attacks
we know that the level of alert has been lowered in two thousand and fourteen said laurent
but he said the level of alert could and should have been raised
speaking just about the kouachi brothers and coulibaly laurent said
actually they could not be considered as a lower level threat
those people were extremely dangerous they were very motivated and the french have made a huge mistake by letting them off the radar or allowing them such a level of freedom in terms of operating finance and preparing this attack he said
brisard head of the french center for the analysis of terror agreed
coulibaly had made several phone calls to target police in france
coulibaly is believed to have killed a french policewoman on thursday
he was killed during the hostage attack on the kosher market on friday
while not known previously it is now believed the kouachi brothers jihadism extended beyond iraq to yemen and al qaeda in the arabian peninsula
during their rampage the kouachi brothers had told witnesses they were avenging the prophet
on the day of their final shootout and deaths french station bfm says it spoke with both cherif kouachi and coulibaly
the men both gave details of their jihadist yemeni ties
they said independently that they were financed and supported by anwar al awlawki the american born cleric who became the a key jihadi leader in yemen and was killed by americans several years ago
the ties to yemen and al qaeda prompted many of the experts speaking to cnn to raise even more security concerns for the future
said kouachi is suspected of slipping off for terror training in yemen in july two thousand and eleven during a trip he made with another french national to oman in july two thousand and eleven according to multiple french officials who spoke to l'express national security reporter eric pelletier
pelletier shared the details of his reporting with cnn
u.s. intelligence agencies developed intelligence suggesting a high probability he slipped across to yemen during the trip to oman and informed their french counterparts according to pelletier's french sources
the french responded by placing said kouachi under surveillance in november two thousand and eleven by issuing a fiche de surveillance notice multiple french officials told pelletier
the surveillance was conducted by both dgsi france's domestic security service and later by the judicial police
wiretaps were authorized for his cell phones and that of his brother cherif
but the surveillance of said was terminated in june two thousand and fourteen because french security services judged him no longer dangerous pelletier was told
the surveillance of his brother cherif stopped earlier at the end of two thousand and thirteen
cherif's phone calls suggested he had disengaged with violent extremism and was focusing on counterfeiting clothing and shoes
the fact that al qeada's affiliate in yemen pulled off the most deadly terrorist attack in europe in a decade speaks for itself said cnn national security analyst peter bergen an expert on al qaeda and osama bin laden
groups like al qaeda in yemen as well as isis and other jihadist groups in the middle east are likely to continue to be a problem in europe for the foreseeable future
hindsight is of course always twenty twenty
in the case of a large scale terrorist attack there is often intelligence in the system that was overlooked before the event said bergen
the cia for instance knew that two men associated with al qaeda were living in the united states who later turned out to be among the hijackers of the flight that crashed into the pentagon on nine eleven. the lead bomber in the london bombings of two thousand and five was known to british law enforcement and the fort hood shooter major nidal hasan had come to the attention of the fbi because of emails he exchanged before the attack with anwar al awlaki an al qaeda leader based in yemen
this time it's the french that dropped the ball but this is not a problem particular to france

i think it's fair to say that we should have sent someone with a higher profile to be there white house press secretary josh earnest said monday afternoon
he said obama himself would have liked to attend the march had the circumstances been a little different
but planning began friday night thirty six hours before the event began and there wasn't enough time for the onerous and significant security work that needed to take place ahead of a presidential visit earnest said
he said obama's presence also would have meant extra restrictions on the people who were there
that said there is no doubt that the american people and this administration stand foursquare behind our allies in france as they face down this threat he said
and that was evident throughout last week
more than forty world leaders including the british german and israeli heads of state and russia's foreign minister joined at least one point five million people on the paris streets sunday for a unity march that became france's biggest ever public demonstration
but obama and his administration's top hands were nowhere to be found an absence that triggered complaints that he missed a key leadership opportunity
the united states appeared to have options to send to the march
obama spent sunday at the white house with no public events on his schedule
vice president joe biden was at home in delaware for the weekend also with a blank public schedule
outgoing attorney general eric holder was already in paris for security meetings and even recorded interviews with several u.s. sunday morning programs but he didn't attend the march
a secret service official said the agency was not asked to draw up security plans for a potential presidential trip to paris in advance of sunday's march
we weren't asked or notified about a trip the official said
but the agency had secret service agents on the ground in paris per its standard operating procedure
it would have been a challenging advance
based on what we know secret service spokesman brian leary said
but leary did not say that such an advance would have been impossible
during the white house briefing earnest suggested security challenges were a factor in not having the president travel to paris
but earnest acknowledged the secret service could have pulled it off
an agency official noted previous last minute presidential trips have happened during the obama presidency including a hurried visit to south africa in december two thousand and thirteen for the memorial service for nelson mandela
the white house noted that it was represented in paris on sunday and has offered support to france in recent days
u.s
ambassador to france jane hartley was in the march as was assistant secretary of state victoria nuland
at a security summit holder was joined in those security meetings by deputy homeland security secretary alejandro mayorkas
obama personally visited the french embassy in washington last week to offer his support
secretary of state john kerry meanwhile will visit paris on friday
kerry skipped monday's march because he was in india on monday for a long planned event there with new prime minister narendra modi a key relationship as the united states tries to improve long strained trade ties with the country
kerry brushed the criticism off as quibbling saying he'll visit paris on his way back to the united states to make crystal clear how passionately we feel about the attacks and response
the u.s. has been deeply engaged with the people of france since this incident occurred kerry told reporters adding that the united states has offered intelligence and law enforcement help
this is sort of quibbling a little bit in the sense that our assistant secretary of state victoria nuland was there and marched our ambassador was there and marched many people from the embassy were there and marched
france's ambassador to the united states gerard araud sought to show there are no hard feelings tweeting on monday
i am extremely grateful for the overwhelming support france has received from everybody here from the president to the ordinary american
the white house's push back comes as obama takes heat particularly from republicans considering two thousand and sixteen presidential bids for his absence
rick perry tweeted that obama should have stood with france in person to defend western values and show support for victims
sen. ted cruz wrote for time
our president should have been there because we must never hesitate to stand with our allies
and sen. marco rubio said monday that it was a mistake not to send someone
rubio said on cbs this morning that he understands that the president's security detail can be problem in mass gatherings like the rally but suggested holder or kerry should have gone in his place
i think in hindsight i would hope that they would do it differently rubio said
british prime minister david cameron german chancellor angela merkel israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu palestinian authority president mahmoud abbas and russian foreign minister sergey lavrov were among those who attended along with religious leaders
fareed zakaria host of cnn's global public square called the absence of top u.s. officials a mistake
france is the united states deepest ideological ally he said and it would have been a meaningful image to have a senior administration member or the president standing shoulder to shoulder with other leaders
zakaria noted that security concerns didn't dissuade netanyahu or abbas or other leaders from showing up
but obama's absence did show that the struggle against radical islam is not all about america zakaria said
many people have tended to think that islamic terrorism wouldn't exist without america zakaria said
this is really a struggle between the civilized world and a band of extremists
even if you take the u.s. out of it
the civilized world is up in arms
and jake tapper host of cnn's the lead said american leaders were conspicuously absent from historic paris rally perhaps the most important public demonstrations in europe in the last generation
tapper not only called out the president and his administration but also prospective two thousand and sixteen hopefuls from both parties for missing the opportunity to share in the global moment
obama spoke about the paris attacks on friday saying he wants the people of france to know the united states stands with you today stands with you tomorrow
the white house also announced sunday that it will host a february eighteen summit aimed at countering violent extremism
earnest said that event will highlight domestic and international efforts to prevent violent extremists and their supporters from radicalizing recruiting or inspiring individuals or groups in the united states and abroad to commit acts of violence efforts made even more imperative in light of recent tragic attacks in ottawa sydney and paris
he said the summit will include presentations panel discussions and small group meetings focused on the local state and federal government levels

divers found the flight data recorder under the wreckage of one of the plane's wings said bambang soelistyo the head of indonesia's search and rescue agency
the search teams have also found but not yet recovered the other key source of information about the plane
the cockpit voice recorder said mardjono siswosuwarno the chief investigator into the crash
the voice recorder is underneath debris he said expressing hope that it could be retrieved easily
the two devices known popularly as black boxes are seen as crucial to unraveling the mystery of what brought down flight qz eight thousand five hundred and one as it flew toward singapore from the indonesian city of surabaya with one hundred and sixty two people on board
finding the data recorder is a huge step in the right direction for investigators said cnn aviation correspondent rene marsh
it gives them so much information that they didn't have before
coupled with the debris that's already been collected the data recorder will enable investigators to begin to paint the picture of exactly what happened when things went terribly wrong for this aircraft marsh said
the data recorder is expected to provide a vast range of information about what the plane was doing including its air speed engine performance and the cabin pressure
the discovery of the device under the wreckage of a wing is significant according to mary schiavo a former inspector general of the u.s. department of transportation
that itself is a clue because i think that pretty much indicates that the plane broke apart when it hit the water she said adding that if the aircraft had broken up at a high altitude investigators wouldn't have found the wreckage that close together
one indonesian search official who goes by the single name of supriyadi said the debris pattern suggests the aircraft exploded on impact
but the country's transportation investigators said it was premature to speculate about what had happened and one expert questioned the search official's choice of words
the word exploded i think maybe loses a little bit in translation said david soucie a former federal aviation administration safety inspector
i think really what he's meaning is a rupture from the impact itself
as with any hollow object hitting something very hard the pressure differential between the outside and the inside is very significant and it'll actually tear apart the aircraft on the top soucie told cnn
that may be what he's referring to
the cockpit voice recorder is expected to give insight into how the pilots responded to the crisis that brought down the plane
it captures all sounds on the flight deck notably conversations between the crew members
the flight data recorder is expected to be taken to a lab in jakarta the indonesian capital for analysis
once the information is downloaded investigators should have a pretty good idea within a couple of days of what happened aboard the plane schiavo said
the devices usually contain hundreds of parameters and thousands of data points she said that look a bit like an ekg when they're printed out
but schiavo added that she didn't think officials would release any information publicly for a couple of weeks
french aviation experts are helping the indonesian investigation which also expected to involve airbus the manufacturer of the downed plane an a three hundred and twenty two hundred
the tail section of the aircraft which houses the black boxes was lifted from the java sea on saturday
but searchers didn't find the flight recorders inside it
the flight data recorder was found about two point five kilometers from the location of the tail according to soelistyo the head of the search agency
searchers are still looking for the plane's fuselage where many of the bodies of those on board the plane might be located
a total of forty eight bodies have so far been recovered from the sea some of them still strapped into seats
authorities have identified most of them
eben tanapurtra who lost seven family members in the disaster told cnn that he was happy to hear the flight data recorder has been found but that his family and others hope authorities won't focus only on the black boxes
please please continue the search for the missing bodies he said
we understand that the black box is crucial and so important for investigation
but please do not consider the efforts to find the bodies as a less important thing
bad weather has hampered the search efforts for the aircraft which are now in their sixteen th day
flight qz eight thousand five hundred and one operated by airasia's indonesian affiliate went down on december twenty eight
the pilot had requested permission to turn and climb to a higher altitude minutes before contact was lost according to indonesian officials

as terrified residents scattered into bushes in baga town and surrounding villages the gunmen unloaded motorcycles from their trucks and followed in hot pursuit
some sought refuge in their homes
they were burned alive
many who tried to cross into neighboring chad drowned while trying to swim through lake chad
by the time the weapons went quiet local officials reported death tolls ranging from hundreds to as many as two thousand people
that was january three nine days ago
on monday bodies still littered the bushes in the area
it is still not safe to go and pick them up for burial said musa bukar the chairman of the local government where baga is located
no emergency crews will enter the villages where militants are still running amok local authorities said
baga is not accessible because it is still occupied by boko haram said sen. maina ma'aji lawan of northern borno state
the strategic nigerian town borders chad giving the extremists better access to both countries
boko haram has terrorized northern nigeria regularly since two thousand and nine attacking police schools churches and civilians and bombing government buildings
the islamist group has said its aim is to impose a stricter form of sharia law across nigeria which is split between a majority muslim north and a mostly christian south
the group's brutal tactics have shocked and stunned the world
it has kidnapped students including more than two hundred schoolgirls who were abducted in april and remain missing
on saturday explosives strapped to a girl detonated at a crowded marketplace in nigeria killing at least twenty people
although no one has claimed responsibility boko haram militants are the main suspects
but the scale of the early january attack the death of hundreds possibly thousands defies belief
the attacks started at dawn on january three and continued throughout the weekend according to residents
each new crime committed by boko haram exceeds the last in brutality
this is a direct consequence of the environment of total impunity in which boko haram operates
every time they get away with mass murder rape and the enslavement of women and children they are emboldened angelina jolie special envoy of u.n. high commissioner for refugees said in a statement
she urged the united states and other nations to offer nigeria help to collect evidence and bring the perpetrators of these attacks to justice
if reports that the town was largely razed to the ground and that hundreds or even as many as two thousand civilians were killed are true this marks a disturbing and bloody escalation of boko haram's ongoing onslaught said daniel eyre nigeria researcher for amnesty international
the nigerian military said the description of the attack as the deadliest was quite valid
the attack on the town by the bloodhounds and their activities since january three should convince well meaning people all over the world that boko haram is the evil all must collaborate to end it said
the misery is far from over
those who survived the attack and tried to swim to chad are now stranded on kangala island on lake chad
chadian authorities are asking the united nations to help relocate more than one thousand of them
abubakar gamandi a native of baga who was away during the attack said those trapped there are dying
i have been in touch with them on the phone he said
they told me some of them are dying from lack of food cold and malaria on the mosquito infested island
of the thirty thousand people displaced during the attacks twenty thousand camped in maiduguri city
an additional ten thousand were being ferried from monguno town which is about sixty kilometers from baga
mike omeri a national security spokesman said nigerian troops are pursuing the militants
security forces have responded rapidly and have deployed significant military assets and conducted airstrikes against militant targets omeri said
troops are engaged in operations to reclaim the area from the terrorists
but gamandi the baga native said it's not true
from information we are receiving from residents nearby not a single nigerian soldier has shown up in baga since it was seized by boko haram he said
it is all propaganda
critics have accused president goodluck jonathan's government of not doing enough to address the insurgency which mostly affects opposition strongholds
nigeria is holding presidential elections next month
last week jonathan launched his re election bid in a raucous rally in lagos
he did not say a word about the massacres

millions rallied in paris against terrorism and extremism over the weekend
thousands of police officers and at least ten thousand soldiers are being deployed across france
and the remaining suspect in last week's terror attacks remains on the loose
and the shooting of a random jogger wednesday has reportedly been linked to the spate of violence that included the attack at french satirical magazine charlie hebdo the deadly siege at a kosher store and the killing of a policewoman
here's the latest on the investigation the response and the lingering threat
astonishing sight
more than three point seven million people marched throughout france in colossal anti terrorism rallies sunday
french officials say the outpouring was the largest gathering in the country's history
notable absence
forty world leaders marched in solidarity at the paris event but neither president barack obama nor any other high ranking u.s. official was there
u.s. secretary of state john kerry was in india attending an entrepreneurship summit
kerry said monday he'll be headed to france on thursday and called the criticism against the administration sort of quibbling
the u.s. has been deeply engaged with the people of france since this incident occurred kerry said
white house spokesman josh earnest said monday i think it's fair to say that we should have sent someone with a higher profile to be there
surprising gesture
among those condemning the attack included the palestinian militant group hamas which the united states and others consider a terrorist organization
the difference of opinions and thoughts can not justify murder the group said over the weekend
but hamas didn't specifically condemn the attack on the jewish supermarket that left four people dead
fighting back
just as they promised to do hackers claiming to be with the group anonymous say they have blocked a jihadist website in retaliation for the attack
the website ansar alhaqq dot net a french jihadist site was redirected to the search engine duck duck go
hackers using the twitter handle opcharliehebdo claimed responsibility
going home
the bodies of the four jewish victims in the deadly standoff at the kosher market in eastern paris will be taken to israel for burial
the funerals will take place tuesday
israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu also said any jews who want to immigrate to israel will be welcome
ever vigilant
at least ten thousand soldiers and eight thousand police officers will be deployed across france as it elevates its national security alert system to the highest level
prime minister manuel valls said an estimated four thousand seven hundred officers will be tasked with securing seven hundred and seventeen jewish schools
we must remain vigilant because the threat is still very much present valls told cnn affiliate bfmtv
sleeper cells
french police were told saturday that sleeper cells had been activated over the past twenty four hours inside france terror expert samuel laurent said he was told by a police source
he said officers were told to erase all visible online presence on social media and keep their weapons on themselves at all times
newspaper firebombed
hamburger morgenpost a german newspaper that reprinted the charlie hebdo cartoons was firebombed early sunday
the incendiary device was thrown into the archive section of the building
no one was inside at the time
another newspaper le soir in belgium was evacuated after someone called in a bomb threat
ripple effect
the head of the british mi five intelligence service issued a warning that al qaeda is plotting to massacre a huge number of civilians in britain and other western countries
and the new york police department told officers to remain alert after someone re released a september isis message that tells followers to rise up and kill intelligence officers police officers soldiers and civilians
the threat specifically named the united states france australia and canada as targets
in all seventeen people were massacred by at least three terror suspects over three days
the first terror attack wednesday killed twelve people at the charlie hebdo office in paris
the next day a french policewoman was gunned down
on the third and final day four hostages were killed when a terrorist seized a jewish grocery
a fourth attack 
did amedy coulibaly who took customers and workers hostage at a kosher market in eastern paris on friday also shoot a jogger earlier in the week 
paris prosecutor francois molins said the attacks on the jogger wednesday and the supermarket were linked after a ballistic analysis of the bullet casings french media reported
but investigators can't confirm with certainty that it was coulibaly who shot the jogger
the jogger is reportedly still in a hospital with life threatening injuries
in all four people are suspected in the paris attacks
brothers cherif kouachi thirty two and said kouachi thirty four who rampaged through the offices of charlie hebdo
security forces killed them friday ending a widespread manhunt
amedy coulibaly thirty two who took hostages at the kosher supermarket and is suspected of killing the policewoman
authorities also killed him
hayat boumeddiene twenty six is coulibaly's partner and suspected co conspirator
she remains at large
linked together
three of the four suspects were thought to be part of the same jihadist group said pascal disant of the alliance police union
also at least one suspect in the supermarket standoff demanded the freedom of the suspects in the charlie hebdo attack
boumeddiene was not in france at the time of the attacks according to turkey's anadolu news agency
she arrived in turkey from madrid on january two then traveled to syria
the last place authorities spotted boumeddiene was somewhere near turkey's border with syria
valls told cnn that authorities are looking into whether boumeddiene helped prepare the attacks before leaving france
is aqap involved 
al qaeda in the arabian peninsula has claimed responsibility for the attack at charlie hebdo the founder of the magazine the intercept told cnn
but cnn has not independently confirmed this assertion
possible al awlaki tie
but u.s. authorities believe charlie hebdo attacker said kouachi may have met with the late american terrorist cleric anwar al awlaki at some point in yemen and received orders from al qaeda in the arabian peninsula to carry out an attack a u.s. official told cnn's barbara's starr
isis paraphernalia found
investigators discovered isis flags automatic weapons and detonators in an apartment near paris rented by coulibaly france's rtl radio reported sunday citing authorities
while boumeddiene remains at large her partner's hideaway may provide more clues about her

but president barack obama didn't attend a unity march in paris on sunday days after the deadly attack on the satirical newspaper charlie hebdo
nor did his secretary of state john kerry who has deep ties to france
holder
not yet sure which group is behind paris attack
kerry was in india attending an entrepreneurship summit with new prime minister narendra modi with whom the united states is hoping to develop much closer trade ties
instead the united states was represented by u.s
ambassador to france jane hartley
attorney general eric holder was also in paris attending a security summit on combating terrorism
he recorded interviews that appeared on several u.s. news outlets sunday but was not spotted at the unity march
no one from the administration would speak on record about the u.s. representation at the march
attorney general holder a cabinet level official is representing the united states at the security meetings in paris today
he is joined by the dhs deputy secretary alejandro mayorkas
the united states is represented at the march by ambassador hartley a senior obama administration official said
an administration official added
as far as public signs of french solidarity from the u.s. don't forget several public statements from the president his call to french president francois hollande and a condolence stop to the french embassy
beyond that the official said all relevant components of the u.s. government have been aiding their french counterparts in some cases on essentially a minute by minute basis to support their efforts
on sunday night a white house official who also asked not to be named added
it is worth noting that the security requirements for both the president and can be distracting from events like this for once this event is not about us
the official did not address how other prominent world leaders were able to work around the security requirements
hundreds of thousands of people attended the march in paris on sunday waving both french flags and those of other nations
british prime minister david cameron israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu german chancellor angela merkel palestinian authority president mahmoud abbas and russian foreign minister sergey lavrov were among those who attended along with religious leaders
speaking on air with cnn's jake tapper who was at the rally global public square host fareed zakaria called the absence of top officials a mistake
france is the united states deepest ideological ally he said and it would have been a meaningful image to have a senior administration member or the president standing shoulder to shoulder with other leaders
zakaria noted that security concerns didn't dissuade netanyahu or abbas or other leaders from showing up
but obama's absence did show that the struggle against radical islam is not all about america he said
many people have tended to think that islamic terrorism wouldn't exist without america zakaria said
this is really a struggle between the civilized world and a band of extremists
even if you take the u.s. out of it
the civilized world is up in arms
obama commented on the paris attacks friday in tennessee saying he wants the people of france to know the united states stands with you today stands with you tomorrow
the white house also announced sunday that it will host a feb. eighteen summit aimed at countering violent extremism
white house press secretary josh earnest said that event will highlight domestic and international efforts to prevent violent extremists and their supporters from radicalizing recruiting or inspiring individuals or groups in the united states and abroad to commit acts of violence efforts made even more imperative in light of recent tragic attacks in ottawa sydney and paris
he said the summit will include presentations panel discussions and small group meetings focused on the local state and federal government levels

central paris became a marching ground for world leaders and thousands of people taking a stand against the three terror attacks that began with the shooting at the charlie hebdo headquarters
named by government officials as a march of unity crowds of people many with banners bearing the unifying slogan je suis charlie gathered near the place de la republique amid heightened security
here are a few highlights from the event
many were taken aback by the show of solidarity
leaders who joined french president francois hollande included germany's angela merkel russian foreign minister sergey lavrov turkish prime minister ahmet davutoglu spain's mariano rajoy jordan's king abdullah ii and queen rania palestinian authority president mahmoud abbas and israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu
british prime minister david cameron took to twitter to express his support
french police were on high alert standing guard among the dignitaries
cnn crews were also present to capture the moments
but it wasn't just a parisian affair
people took to the streets in other parts of france as well as cities across europe
the paris rally seemed peaceful and orderly a stark contrast to the horrific events of last week sending out a strong yet dignified message on the world's stance against terror

lassana bathily an employee at the hyper cacher kosher supermarket in vincennes helped guide a group of hostages into a downstairs walk in freezer while gunman amedy coulibaly was allegedly preparing to kill them according to french television station bfmtv
bathily a practicing muslim says he entered the freezer with some people then switched off the freezer and the light and told everyone to stay calm according to bfmtv
i'm the one is going to go out he reportedly told them
i took the elevator and went upstairs
coulibaly asked us to all come upstairs otherwise he would kill everyone who was downstairs bathily twenty four said to bfmtv
he exited a freight elevator and ran outside
bathily originally from mali was apprehended by police but helped them by describing the location of the freezer
when the hostages came out they congratulated me bathily told bfmtv
the exact number of hostages who remained safe in the freezer is unknown according to french newspaper l'express
coulibaly was killed in the ensuing shootout with police
authorities said coulibaly killed four jewish hostages
rudi hadad among those in the freezer said that a few others went back upstairs during the incident
praise was heaped on bathily via facebook
gwadelle edom said lass i have no words to express my pride in you
you put your life in danger to save others
god saw all of it and his mercy will be without fault
you are blessed in the eyes of humanity
a man who claims to be bathily's cousin abdoul bathily posted bravo to my cousin lass bathily you showed courage yesterday the rest of the world would not have done it
france's l'express newspaper ran a headline titled lassana bathily musulman malien hros de la prise d'otages de vincennes or lassana bathily malian muslim hero of the hostage situation in vincennes
gunman tried to justify market raid to hostages recording apparently shows

that's one challenge for authorities in the wake of last week's bloodshed in france
understanding what happened is one thing
understanding why it happened requires not just knowing the players involved but also their backgrounds and how they were linked
and according to authorities and sources the links extend between the suspects in the paris shootings and some of biggest names in the terror world
they have been tied to two of the world's biggest and strongest terrorist groups
al qaeda and isis
the names cherif kouachi said kouachi amedy coulibaly and hayat boumeddiene are now known around the world with three of them dead and the fourth boumeddiene being sought
here's what they did and their relationship to one other
who was he 
like his brother said the thirty two year old french citizen of algerian descent was born in paris and raised in orphanages and foster homes from a young age
reports in french media described him as a rap fan more interested in chasing girls than going to the mosque at least until he became a student of well known french spiritual leader farid benyettou
where did he go 
french justice minister christiane taubira told cnn that one of the kouachi brothers had been in yemen in two thousand and five but did not say which one
on friday shortly before his death as police stormed the building where he and his brother had holed up cherif kouachi told cnn affiliate bfmtv that he'd trained in yemen with al qaeda in the arabian peninsula
the united states believes cherif kouachi traveled to yemen in two thousand and eleven but investigators are still trying to confirm that the trip happened and corroborate details with other intelligence a u.s. official said
in two thousand and five he was arrested for being part of a jihadist recruitment ring in paris that sent fighters to join the conflict in iraq
the arrest came not long before he and another man were about to set off for syria en route to iraq where war was raging
evidence suggests cherif kouachi traveled to syria and returned to france in august two thousand and fourteen a french source close to that nation's security services told cnn
who did he know 
in his conversation with bfmtv cherif kouachi said he met with anwar al awlaki the american born muslim who was the face of aqap until he was killed in the fall of two thousand and eleven in a u.s. drone strike
while in pretrial detention before his eventual conviction of being part of a jihadist recruitment ring cherif met djamel beghal who was in prison for his role in an attempted attack against the u.s. embassy in paris in two thousand and one
beghal a french algerian was once known as al qaeda's premiere european recruiter
cherif kouachi and amedy coulibaly were also close associates according to court documents obtained by cnn which show that french authorities knew alarming details about them as recently as a year ago
once they were freed from prison they would visit beghal bringing him food and money and sometimes spending days at his apartment
boumeddiene was also part of the visits
cherif kouachi and coulibaly hid their conversations by using code names over disposable cell phones according to the court documents
who was he 
like his brother cherif the thirty four year old french citizen grew up an orphan
mohammed benali who runs the mosque in gennevilliers the suburb where cherif kouachi had an apartment said the two brothers used to come to friday prayers there not assiduously but regularly
he told le figaro that he knew said kouachi better but that he hadn't seen either of the brothers at the mosque in at least two years
he said the older brother was a very reserved man but he recalled one angry outburst in the mosque when the imam encouraged the faithful to vote in the presidential election
said kouachi had an angry reaction he left the prayer room and voiced his disagreement benali said
for these lunatics when we practice and teach moderate islam actual islam we're nonbelievers
where did he go 
a senior yemeni national security official told cnn that said kouachi entered yemen multiple times with an officially issued visa during which time he was not being watched
kouachi first went to yemen in two thousand and nine said yemeni journalist and researcher mohammed al kibsi
officials haven't confirmed a connection between the two
he stayed there until mid two thousand and ten before leaving briefly and returning at the end of that year
he remained in yemen most of two thousand and eleven according to kibsi who said he met the man twice
u.s. officials have said said kouachi spent several months in yemen in two thousand and eleven receiving weapons training and working with al qaeda in the arabian peninsula
al kibsi said he saw kouachi again in two thousand and twelve in the old city of sanaa at another arabic language center
usa today reported that said kouachi traveled to syria
who did he know 
while in yemen he lived in the same apartment as convicted underwear bomber umar farouk abdulmutallab journalist al kibsi said
this would have had to have been before december two thousand and nine when abdulmutallab was detained in detroit after his commercial airline bombing plot failed
kouachi said that he and abdulmutallab used to pray together at yemen's al tabari school and that they shared an apartment for one to two weeks in yemen according to al kibisi
kouachi was studying arabic grammar at the sanaa arabic grammar institute al kibisi said
cnn does not have official confirmation that said kouachi knew abdulmutallab a nigerian national who authorities said at his u.s. trial told the fbi that he that he had links to yemen based al qaeda in the arabian peninsula
it's also possible that he met al awlaki while in yemen
last year alone his wife exchanged five hundred phone calls with at large suspect hayat boumeddiene according to paris prosecutor francois molin
the wife told investigators that her husband and suspect amedy coulibaly knew each other well
who was he 
the thirty two year old went by the alias doly gringny
before this week he was known to french authorities dating back at least to his may eighteen two thousand and ten arrest for his involvement in an attempt to free an algerian serving time for a one thousand nine hundred and ninety five subway bombing according to court documents obtained by cnn
where did he go 
little is known about coulibaly's travels beyond that he and girlfriend hayat boumeddiene traveled to malaysia together
who did he know 
at the time of his two thousand and ten arrest for the prison break plot he had two hundred and forty rounds of ammunition for a kalishnikov and photo of himself with beghal
cherif kouachi was also implicated in the prison plot but he denied involvement and was not jailed for that
in court documents coulibaly was described as a logistics expert in charge of accumulating weapons and arms for the prison break plot
police also found computers with security and encryption and recipes for poison purportedly capable of killing a million people
he was sentenced to four years in prison but released early
last week after he was killed during his attack on a kosher grocery store in paris police again raided his apartment and found a cache of arms and detonators
before he was killed by police amedy coulibaly purportedly told cnn affiliate bfmtv by phone that he belonged to isis or the islamic state in iraq and syria the terror group trying to create a fundamentalist religious state across sunni areas in those two countries
that information hasn't been corroborated by authorities and it's not known whether he knew any leaders or members of that terrorist group
coulibaly shared a residence with boumeddiene and they traveled to malaysia together the source said
who is she 
the french newspaper le monde posted photos purporting to show the twenty six year old boumeddiene in two thousand and ten in a rural location wearing a niqab and holding a weapon that appears to be a crossbow
a niqab is a head to toe black covering a woman's body completely except for the eyes
cnn has not independently confirmed the authenticity of the stills
in one of the photos a woman le monde identifies as boumeddiene is shown in a niqab is posing near cheek to cheek with coulibaly in what the newspaper called a selfie
french authorities said they wanted her in connection with thursday killing of a policewoman in montrouge
but now it's come out that she may not have even been in france at the time
she's still wanted by authorities in connection with the attack
a neighbor in a southern paris suburb said she seemed kind and polite always wearing a veil and often motoring around on a scooter with her romantic partner amedy coulibaly
where did she go 
beyond traveling to malaysia with coulibaly boumeddiene's official travel history in recent years is sparse
boumeddiene is believed to have left for turkey of course to reach syria at the beginning of the year according to a french source close to the nation's security services
she was tracked by turkish authorities to a location near the turkey syria border according to an official in the turkish prime minister's office
boumeddiene arrived at the istanbul airport on a flight from madrid on january two with a man
during routine screening of passengers the couple were flagged by turkey's risk assessment center and a decision made to maintain surveillance on their movements the official said
who did she know 
boumeddiene exchanged five hundred phone calls with the wife of cherif kouachi in two thousand and fourteen according to paris prosecutor francois molins
the wife told investigators that her husband and coulibaly knew each other well

the day was emotional and peaceful a gesture of unity just days after islamic extremists slaughtered seventeen people
world leaders joined french president francois hollande including british prime minister david cameron german chancellor angela merkel and spanish prime minister mariano rajoy
the day also brought together an unlikely duo at the rally
palestinian authority president mahmoud abbas and israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu
the rally began with a march through paris streets at three p.m. but a massive group of people stayed into the night
among them was dalil boubakeur the rector of the great mosque of paris and president of the french council of the muslim faith
one man in the crowd said the french people must not give in to fear
terrorists he said will not win
others carried signs that echoed the now famous phrase that honored slain journalists at the magazine charlie hebdo je suis charlie
zineb el rhazoui a journalist at the magazine talked about the magazine's financial struggles and the difficulty of working under constant threats
i am very happy for all this help but for us it was a heavy price to pay and it is too much
it took twelve deaths for us to finally be a little bit understood after we have been hated and booed by everybody
for the guards and police officers who lost their lives in last week's attacks in france there were signs reading we are all cops
for muslims in france who want to convey that the ideology embraced by the muslim gunmen does not represent the whole of the faith signs read we are all muslims
for everyone no matter their race class or ethnic background signs that said we are all french were held up with pride
sunday brought the end to a traumatic week in france
brothers cherif and said kouachi the charlie hebdo gunmen were killed friday after one of two violent standoffs
twelve people were slain at the satirical magazine offices on wednesday
in the other standoff amedy coulibaly suspected in the shooting death of a police officer was killed by security forces friday after he shot and killed four hostages during a siege at a kosher market
french law enforcement officers were told to remove their social media presence and carry their weapons at all times because terror sleeper cells had been activated over the past twenty four hours in the country a french police source who attended a briefing saturday told cnn terror analyst samuel laurent
coulibaly had made several phone calls about targeting police officers in france according to the source
a video that appears to show coulibaly pledging allegiance to terror group isis leader abu bakr al baghdadi is being shared on jihadist websites
brian hale the spokesman for the u.s. director of national intelligence told cnn on sunday that the u.s. intelligence community is aware of the video and is reviewing it to determine its authenticity
threats against people outside of france particularly against journalists persisted sunday
the offices of belgian newspaper le soir were evacuated sunday after members of the newsroom received an anonymous phone call of a bomb threat the newspaper reported

and officials in the new york city police department responded to a threat from isis after someone re released a september two thousand and fourteen message that tells followers to rise up and kill intelligence officers police officers soldiers and civilians specifically naming the united states france australia and canada as targets
nypd employees were told to remain alert and consider tactics at all times while on patrol especially in light of the attacks in france last week in an internal memo
the federal bureau of investigation and the u.s. department of homeland security issued a similar bulletin to law enforcement
both notices make clear that the threat is consistent with previous threats isis and others including al qaeda have made
as investigators worked leads a sea of demonstrators in paris broke into song held hands cheered and passionately denounced violence
an imam and a number of muslims were in the crowd
a young muslim french woman held a sign that said i am a jew
she told cnn's frederik pleitgen that she was horrified to hear of the killings and the killers do not live according to the islamic principles she's been taught
our religion is the religion of love

our religion loves jews
loves christians
we are not terrorists one muslim man said his voice rising
he lifted his arm and gestured to many people around him who came to denounce violence
we are all muslim
french officials announced exceptional measures to protect the throngs gathered near the place de la republique in central paris and a who's who of foreign leaders at the rally a test of the security forces of a nation rocked by days of terrorist violence
after the rally hollande arrived to huge applause and a cheering crowd at the synagogue de la victoire to show support for france's jews
he was joined by netanyahu
the targeting of the kosher grocery store shook the nation's jewish communities
amid heightened security concerns the synagogue was closed saturday for the first time since world war ii
on sunday jerusalem of gold a popular song by naomi shemer that became an anthem during the six day war in one thousand nine hundred and sixty seven played in the place of worship
it was just one of several gestures of solidarity sunday among some of the world's most influential leaders
russian foreign minister sergey lavrov turkish prime minister ahmet davutoglu jordan's king abdullah ii and queen rania were at the rally
several people in the crowd and on social media wondered why u.s. president barack obama was not there
he was at the white house on sunday
cnn has asked for an explanation from the state department and white house of his absence
there has been no response so far
secretary of state john kerry was not at the rally either
a senior state department official told cnn that kerry had committed a long time ago to be the lead speaker at indian prime minister narendra modi's entrepreneurship and innovation summit in india

attorney general eric holder was not at the rally but was in paris this weekend to attend a security summit on combating terrorism
he recorded interviews that aired in the u.s. on sunday
ambassador to france jane hartley represented the united states at the rally
she tweeted several images of the crowd
speaking on air with cnn's jake tapper who was at the rally global public square host fareed zakaria tried to put obama and other senior leaders absence in context
france is the united states deepest ideological ally he said and it would have been a meaningful image to have a senior administration member or the president standing shoulder to shoulder with other leaders
tapper noted that security has been tenuous
interior minister bernard cazeneuve and other officials said two thousand three hundred police officers as well as paramilitary forces would be deployed sunday
the dignitaries and leaders were to be protected by special units
police snipers plainclothes and anti terror officers were deployed and parking and transit restrictions were in place
the government planned to close large sections of the city to traffic cazeneuve said
zakaria observed that security concerns didn't dissuade netanyahu or abbas or other controversial leaders from showing up
the bright side he said is that obama's absence showed that the struggle against radical islam is not all about america
many people have tended to think that islamic terrorism wouldn't exist without america zakaria said
this is really a struggle between the civilized world and a band of extremists
even if you take the u.s. out of it
the civilized world is up in arms
french investigators are still trying to piece connections between three terror suspects killed friday and their suspected links to al qaeda in the arabian peninsula and other terrorist groups
security will remain heightened as the investigations continue officials have said


investigators discovered isis flags automatic weapons detonators and cash in an apartment france's rtl radio reported sunday citing authorities
they say the apartment had been rented by amedi coulibaly who was killed during a police rescue operation to end his siege at a kosher grocery store in paris where authorities say he killed four hostages on friday
but police say his partner and alleged co conspirator hayat boumeddiene is still on the run
the last place authorities spotted her was somewhere near turkey's border with syria
and forensics teams have been examining the apartment in the paris suburb of gentilly to determine whether boumeddiene twenty six might have stayed there before her escape rtl reported
coulibaly had rented the apartment from january four to january eleven police said according to rtl
police began looking into the apartment after the thursday slaying of a policewoman in the paris district of montrouge the station reported
coulibaly was also behind that attack authorities say
and the car in which he allegedly fled the crime scene was ditched in arcueil near the hideout rtl said
after abandoning the car coulibaly boarded a train police told rtl
the details about the hideout came as millions gathered at a massive rally sunday in france where world leaders dignitaries and everyday citizens alike joined unity rallies in defiance of the terror rampage
up to three point seven million people marched throughout france sunday the spokesman for the country's mission to the united nations said describing it as the largest mobilization in his nation's history
beyond france's borders demonstrators showed their support with rallies around the world
at the golden globe awards in beverly hills california audience members gave the president of the hollywood foreign press association a standing ovation when he referenced the attacks vowing to stand against anyone who would repress free speech anywhere from north korea to paris
as he received a lifetime achievement award actor george clooney described sunday's demonstrations and their rallying cry
today was an extraordinary day he said
there were millions of people that marched not just in paris but around the world
and they were christians and jews and muslims
they were leaders of countries all over the world
and they didn't march in protest
they marched in support of the idea that we will not walk in fear
we won't do it
so je suis charlie
in paris police said no incidents had been reported despite the record number of people involved in the march there
france remained on high alert as authorities pieced together who was behind last week's attacks and warned of the threat of more violence
french law enforcement officers have been told to erase their social media presence and carry weapons at all times because terror sleeper cells have been activated in the country a police source said
the source told cnn that the cells were activated in the past twenty four hours
and it's not just french police that are concerned
officials in the new york city police department and other law enforcement personnel across the united states responded to a threat from isis after someone re released a september two thousand and fourteen message that tells followers to rise up and kill intelligence officers police officers soldiers and civilians specifically naming the united states france australia and canada as targets
according to an nypd memo obtained by cnn department employees were told to remain alert and consider tactics at all times while on patrol especially in light of the attacks in france last week
the fbi and department of homeland security issued a similar bulletin to law enforcement across the united states
meanwhile french investigators continued efforts to delve into the attackers backgrounds and track down boumeddiene the lone remaining suspect wanted in the terrorism rampage that left seventeen people dead in three days last week
the clues from his apparent hideaway aren't the only information authorities have about coulibaly
a video circulating on jihadist websites shows him pledging allegiance to isis leader abu bakr al baghdadi
weapons including a rifle serve as a backdrop for the video and an isis flag is prominently displayed during portions of the video
coulibaly identifies himself as abou bassir abdallah al irfiqi and a soldier of the caliphate while warning the west you attack the caliph you attack isis we attack you
you can't attack and not get back anything in return
it's unclear when all the video was shot
the u.s. intelligence community is aware of the video and is reviewing it to determine its authenticity said brian hale spokesman for the u.s. director of national intelligence james clapper
according to a source coulibaly made several phone calls about targeting police officers in france
long before they stormed into the offices of the charlie hebdo satirical magazine last week and killed twelve people french authorities were watching said and cherif kouachi
but despite red flags authorities lost interest in them l'express magazine reported
tipped off by u.s. intelligence agencies that said kouachi may have traveled to yemen france placed him under surveillance in november two thousand and eleven but terminated the scrutiny last year when it deemed him no longer dangerous according to l'express national security reporter eric pelletier who said he talked to multiple french officials
the surveillance of his brother cherif terminated at the end of two thousand and thirteen when his phone calls suggested he had disengaged from violent extremism and was focused on counterfeiting clothing and shoes
u.s. attorney general eric holder responding to a reported claim of responsibility by al qaeda in the arabian peninsula in the charlie hebdo attack told cnn there was no credible information on who sponsored the violence
and u.s. officials sunday said american authorities don't have evidence yet directly linking al qaeda in the arabian peninsula to ordering the attack
but they're assuming that said kouachi met american terrorist cleric anwar al awlaki at some point in yemen and received orders from aqap to carry out an attack a u.s. official told cnn
the official said kouachi's motivation for waiting so long to launch the attack was not clear
the kouachi brothers were killed friday in a shootout with french security forces outside of paris
and investigators are still trying to track down their ties that may have helped them before last week's rampage
on sunday a spokeswoman for pitie salpetriere hospital in paris said farid benyettou a well known spiritual leader believed to have radicalized cherif kouachi had been working as a nurse trainee at the hospital until last friday

stephane charb charbonnier editor of the charlie hebdo magazine was no stranger to controversy for lampooning a variety of subjects including christianity
but his staff's acerbic take on islam generated the most attention and vitriol and made him a target for extremists
years later he became a target of islamic extremists
the al qaeda magazine inspire in its march two thousand and thirteen edition ran a wanted
dead or alive poster that included charbonnier
we do provocation
it's been twenty years since we've been doing provocation and it's being noticed only when we talked about islam or this part of islam which raises problems and which is a minority charbonnier told cnn affiliate bfmtv in two thousand and twelve
and when the government asks us not to do any provocation we have the impression that three idiots who demonstrated in the streets represent all of islam
it's the government who insults muslims by saying that
you have to take them as they are
one has to mock them using humor disarm them with humor and not give them any credit
by taking them seriously and sending regiments of riot cops to hold them one takes them seriously
in two thousand and twelve in an interview with le monde newspaper charbonnier uttered perhaps his most famous quote

now the twenty six year old boumeddiene is the subject of an international dragnet after coulibaly said to be linked to two brothers suspected in the charlie hebdo massacre killed hostages at a paris kosher supermarket friday before police fatally shot him
police earlier named boumeddiene and coulibaly as suspects in thursday's slaying of a female police officer in the southern suburb of montrouge
with coulibaly dead and charlie hebdo suspects cherif and said kouachi killed friday in a separate standoff north of paris boumeddiene is the last prime publicly identified suspect that police are seeking in connection with france's recent wave of terror attacks
a turkish prime ministry source told cnn that boumeddiene entered turkey on january two arriving at the istanbul airport on a flight from madrid with a man
that means she may not have been in france at the time the policewoman was shot on thursday as authorities originally believed
authorities offered no immediate explanation of the discrepancy but have said she is wanted in connection with a terrorist attack
during routine screening of arriving passengers boumeddiene and her companion were flagged by turkey's risk assessment center at the airport and a decision was made to maintain surveillance on their movements
the pair checked into a hotel in istanbul and engaged in tourist type activity for a couple of days
when her name was made public by french investigators after the paris terror attacks turkish authorities alerted their french counterparts to her movements
turkish agents tracked her to what the official said was her last confirmed location near the syrian border
she had a return ticket to madrid for january nine but she failed to take her return flight from istanbul that day according to an official in the office of turkey's prime minister
a french source close to the nation's security services said it's believed that boumeddiene is no longer in france and she is thought to have left for turkey of course to reach syria
french authorities have asked spain to look into the possibility that boumeddiene transited through spain en route to turkey a spanish source close to the nation's security services said
it is not confirmed that she did travel through spain but it is true that we are working on that line of investigation on that possibility the source said
earlier french police union spokesman pascal disant said boumeddiene may have left the market siege and eluded capture as hostages were freed
so far no witness has publicly said she was there
but disant said that the kouachi brothers and coulibaly were part of the same jihadist groups and paris prosecutor francois molins indicated boumedienne and cherif kouachi's wife also were well acquainted saying they exchanged five hundred phone calls in two thousand and fourteen
armed investigators on saturday milled around the apartment shared by coulibaly and boumeddiene in fontenay aux roses south of paris
both of their names were still on a letterbox in the lobby of the building situated across from a library
they lived in an apartment above an indian restaurant for about five years according to a neighbor who spoke on condition of anonymity
the neighbor said the couple were always polite and she often saw them drive around the neighborhood together on a scooter
as far as the neighbor could remember boumeddiene always wore a niqab a veil that some islamic women wear to cover all of their head and face except for the eyes
the french newspaper le parisien reported that boumeddiene was one of seven siblings hailing from villiers sur marne france
her mother died in one thousand nine hundred and ninety four and at age eight or nine she and some of her other siblings were put into foster care when her father struggled to raise them alone le parisien reported
the paper reported that boumeddiene religiously wedded coulibaly in two thousand and nine
the next year coulibaly and cherif kouachi were involved in a two thousand and ten attempt to free an algerian serving time for a one thousand nine hundred and ninety five subway bombing a western intelligence source told cnn
coulibaly was indicted may twenty two two thousand and ten and spent time in prison in connection with the prison break plot
cherif kouachi was under investigation for the same plot but there was not enough evidence to indict him the source said
photos published by the french newspaper le monde purport to show boumeddiene in two thousand and ten in a rural setting wearing a niqab and an abaya a loose garment covering the rest of her body and holding a weapon that appears to be a crossbow
another photo shows her pointing the weapon at the camera but her face is obscured by the niqab with only her eyes exposed
cnn has not independently confirmed the authenticity of the photos

in a four hundred page court record cherif kouachi was described as wanting to travel to iraq through syria to go and combat the americans
on friday security forces surrounded and killed kouachi thirty two and his older brother said thirty four in dammartin en goele france the town's mayor said
the kouachi brothers were wanted in wednesday's massacre at the offices of the satirical magazine charlie hebdo in paris that left twelve people dead
in the two thousand and seven french court documents cherif kouachi stated in a deposition i was ready to go and die in battle and i got this idea when i saw the injustices shown by television on what was going on over there
i am speaking about the torture that the americans have inflicted on the iraqis
the court documents dated december two thousand and seven stem from a two thousand and five arrest
they say cherif kouachi was raised in orphanages and foster homes from a young age and became involved in a group in paris nineteen th arrondissement
he was arrested with other young men from that part of paris for a conspiracy to go to iraq and fight as jihadists
in the documents prosecutors outlined strong details of kouachi's interest in jihad interest in martyrdom and strong links to anti semitism attacking and killing jews
kouachi stated he came to the idea of jihad through farid benyettou a well known spiritual leader who's been long associated in france with supporting jihad and terrorism and is associated with a mosque in the nineteen th arrondissement
through benyettou kouachi was studying how to wield arms and use kalashnikovs
under a section titled motivations of influence describing kouachi court records said he stated the wise leaders in islam told him and his friends that if they die as martyrs in jihad they would go to heaven and that martyrs would be greeted by more than sixty virgins in a big palace in heaven
the documents also said or him any place on earth where there is such an injustice is justification for jihad
what was going on iraq was in his eyes such an injustice
the mosque called la mosquee de stalingrad has since been demolished and appears to be under construction
court records show kouachi said he didn't consider himself a good enough muslim and said he had only been to the mosque two or three times before he met benyettou and he had been smoking cannabis
kouachi told investigators he committed himself to the idea of jihad during ramadan in two thousand and four
he told his friends he was going to syria to fight
the documents say when police interviewed his accomplices they stated that kouachi said he was ready to firebomb and to destroy jewish shops in paris
when officials confronted kouachi with that information he told them that's not exactly what i said

i don't hide having proposed anti semitic ideas but i would note that i never really would have done that


the french government's work is not over
there's still a lot of healing to do a lot of questions to answer about how to prevent future attacks and the pursuit of a woman wanted in the policewoman's shooting
still as interior minister bernard cazeneuve said the nation is relieved tonight
the wife of suspect cherif kouachi and the girlfriend of hostage taker amedy coulibaly hayat boumedienne exchanged five hundred phone calls in two thousand and fourteen according to paris prosecutor francois molin
the wife told investigators that cherif and coulibaly knew each well
cherif kouachi a suspect in the charlie hebdo slaughter visited yemen in two thousand and eleven and french authorities were aware of his contacts with terrorist organizations in yemen and syria molins said at a press conference
the government of yemen has launched an investigation into a possible al qaeda in the arabian peninsula link to the charlie hebdo magazine attack mohammed albasha yemen's spokesman in washington tweeted friday
al qaeda in the arabian peninsula has claimed responsibility for orchestrating the deadly terrorist attack on the paris offices of charlie hebdo the founder of the magazine the intercept jeremy scahill told cnn
cnn has not independently confirmed this claim
four hostages were killed and fifteen survived in the standoff between an armed terrorist and police at a paris kosher grocery store on friday according to israeli government sources who characterized a phone conversation between israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu and french president franois hollande
u.s. president barack obama said he wants the people of france to know that the united states stands with you today stands with you tomorrow after this week's terror
he told a crowd in tennessee that we stand for freedom and hope and dignity of all human beings that's what paris stands for
the fbi and u.s. department of homeland security issued a bulletin to law enforcement across the united states discussing the paris terrorist attack this week and the sophistication of the tactics a u.s. law enforcement source told cnn
the bulletin says the attacks demonstrated a degree of sophistication and training traditionally not seen in recent small armed attacks the official said
a man claiming to be amedy coulibaly the suspected hostage taker at the paris grocery store told cnn affiliate bfmtv that he belonged to the islamist militant group isis
cnn can not independently confirm the authenticity of the recording
the day's drama began in dammartin en goele where brothers cherif and said kouachi ended up in a print shop in an industrial area
a salesman who identified himself only as didier told france info radio that he shook one of the gunman's hands at about eight thirty a.m. as they arrived at the business
didier said he first thought the man who was dressed in black and heavily armed was a police officer
as he left the armed man said go we don't kill civilians
didier said it wasn't normal
i did not know what was going on
the gunmen told police that they wanted to die as martyrs yves albarello who is in france's parliament said on channel itele
the area meanwhile was locked down with children stuck in schools roads closed and shops shuttered
shortly before five p.m. gunshots and at least three large explosions pierced the relative silence

soon after men could be seen on the roof of the building where the brothers had holed up
four helicopters landed nearby
word came that the brothers were dead and that a man who had been hiding in the building was safe said bernard corneille the mayor of nearby othis
at the same time in a different setting near paris's porte de vincennes about forty kilometers away a similar crisis played out at a kosher store
amedy coulibaly the same man who authorities said is suspected with hayat boumeddiene of killing a policewoman thursday south of paris on friday took a number of hostages there
boumeddiene remains at large
like cherif kouachi a man claiming to be coulibaly called bfmtv on friday
at the scene witnesses heard coulibaly demand freedom for the kouachi brothers according to police union spokesman pascal disand
law enforcement swarmed the area
dozens of schools went on lockdown
a resolution came a few minutes after the dammartin en goele climax in the form of explosions and gunfire
up to twenty heavily armed police officers moved into the store
they came out with a number of civilians
not everyone made it
hollande said four people were killed
israeli government sources told cnn that hollande told netanyahu that four hostages were killed and fifteen were rescued
molins said four hostages were killed by the gunman before police stormed the market
in a speech friday night hollande called the porte de vincennes deaths an anti semitic act
he urged his countrymen not to respond with violence against muslims saying those who committed these acts have nothing to do with the muslim religion
unity he said is our best weapon
that kind of military language is apt when you're talking about two deadly attacks and violent standoffs in a few days
it's something that a man who asked to be called simply teddy understands
he was outside henri dunant elementary school in dammartin en goele on friday hoping to pick up his young son
and eventually the students did leave the school accompanied by police officers who held their hands and in some cases lifted them onto an awaiting bus that would take them to safety
it's like a war teddy said
i don't know how i will explain this to my five year old son
this war erupted two days ago when a pair of heavily armed men hooded and dressed in black entered the paris offices of charlie hebdo the satirical magazine known for its provocative often profane take on religion politics and most anything else
satirical magazine is no stranger to controversy
they burst into a meeting called out individuals and then executed them
the dead included editor and cartoonist stephane charbonnier and four other well known cartoonists known by the pen names
cabu wolinski honore and tignous
authorities followed a lead thursday morning from a gas station attendant near villers cotterets about forty kilometers from dammartin en goele whom cherif kouachi thirty two and said kouachi thirty four reportedly threatened as they stole food and gas
police think the brothers may have later fled on foot into nearby woods
as the suspects moved the french government including more than eighty thousand police deployed across the country also didn't stand still
some of them tried to prevent more bloodshed which might have something to do with nine people detained after the charlie hebdo attacks
investigators also dug to learn about the attackers
who are the suspects 
both men had ties to islamist extremists
said the elder of the kouachi brothers spent several months in yemen in two thousand and eleven receiving weapons training and working with al qaeda in the arabian peninsula according to u.s. officials
his younger brother cherif has a long history of jihad and anti semitism according to documents obtained by cnn
in a four hundred page court record he is described as wanting to go to iraq through syria to go and combat the americans
i was ready to go and die in battle he said in a deposition

i got this idea when i saw the injustices shown by television

i am speaking about the torture that the americans have inflicted on the iraqis
a man claiming to be cherif told cnn affiliate bfmtv in a phone call before he was shot and killed friday that he was sent to carry out the massacre by al qaeda in yemen and that the late anwar al awlaki financed his trip
cnn can not independently confirm the authenticity of the recording
al awlaki an american born muslim scholar and cleric who acted as a spokesperson for al qaeda in the arabian peninsula was killed in two thousand and eleven by a cia drone strike
cherif and coulibaly were involved in a two thousand and ten attempt to free an algerian incarcerated for a one thousand nine hundred and ninety five subway bombing
coulibaly was arrested with two hundred and forty rounds of ammunition for a kalashnikov rifle and a photo of djamel beghal a french algerian once known as al qaeda's premier european recruiter
the western intelligence source said that coulibaly lived with boumeddiene his alleged accomplice in the police shooting and that the two traveled to malaysia together
charlie hebdo columnist
they didn't want us to be quiet 
a unity rally will be held sunday celebrating the values behind charlie hebdo said british prime minister david cameron who will travel to paris to attend
and the magazine itself whose former offices were firebombed in two thousand and eleven on the day it was to publish an issue poking fun at islamic law and after it published a cartoon of the muslim prophet mohammed will go on as well even without its leader and most talented staffers
it's set to publish thousands of copies of its latest edition next wednesday
patrick pelloux a columnist for the magazine told cnn that i don't know if i'm afraid anymore because i've seen fear
i was scared for my friends and they are dead
he and many others are defiant
i know that they didn't want us to be quiet pelloux said of the slain charlie hebdo staffers.they would be assassinated twice if we remained silent

the twin episodes one outside the french capital involving the suspects who shot and killed twelve people wednesday at the offices of the satirical magazine the other at a kosher grocery store ended simultaneously with staccato bursts of gunfire and blasts of what appeared to be stun grenades by small armies of law enforcement officers
france is living through a trial when we see the worst massacre of this kind in the last fifty years president francois hollande said in and address to the nation friday
one of the most terrifying weeks in modern french history culminated with the shooting deaths of the suspects in the charlie hebdo slaughter brothers cherif and said kouachi and scenes of still stunned hostages being led to freedom by heavily armed security forces from the kosher supermarket after the man who police say took hostages there was killed
it's like a war a man who identified himself only as teddy said as the episodes unfolded
i don't know how i will explain this to my five year old son
this father lives across the street from a school in the village of dammartin en goele where security forces launched an assault on a graphics printing business where the kouachi brothers had holed themselves up
for hours friday there was no teaching in the classrooms in the small town northeast of paris
dozens of schools were on lockdown
teachers and their pupils hid in fear
mothers approached officers seeking assurances that their children were safe
some students were later allowed to leave
police officers accompanied them holding their hands as they guided the children away
the littlest ones were lifted onto an awaiting bus that would deliver them to the safety of nearby sports facilities
the two suspects told police by phone that they wanted to die as martyrs yves albarello a member of parliament said on french channel itele
shortly before five p.m. helicopters swooped down on the building where the kouachi brothers holed themselves up
explosions and gunfire echoed through the industrial area
smoke rose from the building
at the grocery store in paris four people were killed when police stormed the business near porte de vincennes hollande said
earlier a salesman who identified himself only as didier told france info radio that he had shaken hands with one of the gunmen about eight thirty a.m. friday as they arrived at the printing business
didier at first thought the man who was dressed in black and heavily armed was a police officer he told the public radio station
as he left the armed man told didier go we don't kill civilians
it wasn't normal didier said of his encounter
i did not know what was going on
relief but hunt continues for another suspect
fear of the unknown has gripped france
the dread friday reached an eastern paris kosher grocery store where a man suspected of a killing a police officer a day earlier took a number of hostages including children
the hostage taking suspect amedy coulibaly was a close associate of cherif kouachi a western intelligence source told cnn
about the time security forces killed the kouachi brothers other officers guns blazing moved in on the kosher market
police shouted get down
and we've got him according to video from cnn affiliate bfmtv
some hostages were killed according to french radio reports
a man who presumably was a hostage got out with an infant as did others
among those who may have escaped the building was a female accomplice of the grocery store hostage taker and suspect in thursday's fatal police shooting
on friday night the words paris est charlie french for paris is charlie were triumphantly projected on the iconic arc de triomphe
a new manhunt was launched meanwhile for the only surviving suspect from the two hostage situations police union spokesman pascal disant said
that suspect hayat boumeddiene twenty six was allegedly an accomplice of coulibaly in the standoff at the kosher market
in a televised address to the nation later hollande warned
france is not done with threats that are targeting


but intolerance for that irreverence has cost some of france's most respected and controversial cartoonists their lives
they were among the twelve people killed wednesday during a lunchtime attack on the offices of a paris based satirical magazine that lampooned religious symbols of all faiths
a moment of silence for the victims who also included a popular columnist and a copy editor was observed at noon paris time
charlie hebdo magazine editor stephane charb charbonnier was killed when hooded attackers carrying assault rifles burst in and shouted allahu akbar arabic for god is great as they opened fire according to paris prosecutor francois molins
the attackers said they avenged the prophet
the dead included georges wolinski who worked under the pen name wolinski
jean cabu cabut
bernard tignous verlhac
and philippe honore known as honore
they ranked among the most popular and best known members of a provocative staff whose cartoons of the prophet mohammed in recent years angered some muslims
also killed was journalist economist and charlie hebdo shareholder bernard maris
those killed were targeted for their artistic creations
the gunmen separated the men from the women and called out the names of cartoonists they intended to kill said dr. gerald kierzek a physician who treated wounded patients and spoke with survivors
patrick klugman deputy mayor of paris said the victims included the most famous cartoonists in france in decades
it's a very big and deep shock for all the press and for all the world he said
it's a major major loss
never a newspaper has been by this violence
throughout france and europe thousands rallied wednesday evening expressing solidarity with france and charlie hebdo and defiance to those behind the bloodshed
at an event in paris place de la republique demonstrators raised pens in honor of the slain cartoonists and chanted we are charlie
pictures posted online showed similar demonstrations in other cities including rome berlin and barcelona
charbonnier like his magazine was no stranger to controversy for lampooning a variety of subjects including christianity
but his staff's acerbic take on islam generated the most attention and vitriol and made him a target for extremists
charbonnier forty seven became editor of charlie hebdo in two thousand and nine britain's sky news reported
years later he became a target of islamic extremists
the al qaeda magazine inspire in its march two thousand and thirteen edition ran a wanted
dead or alive poster that included charbonnier
charlie hebdo's latest cover featured a caricature of controversial french author michel houellebecq who penned a novel set in a france governed by muslims
the country has the largest muslim population in western europe with an estimated four point seven million followers of the faith
the cartoon shows houellebecq saying in two thousand and twenty two i will do ramadan
charlie hebdo's last tweet before wednesday's attack featured a cartoon of isis leader abu bakr al baghdadi and the words and above all health
we do provocation
it's been twenty years since we've been doing provocation and it's being noticed only when we talked about islam or this part of islam which raises problems and which is a minority charbonnier told bfmtv in two thousand and twelve
and when the government asks us not to do any provocation we have the impression that three idiots who demonstrated in the streets represent all of islam
it's the government who insults muslims by saying that
you have to take them as they are
one has to mock them using humor disarm them with humor and not give them any credit
by taking them seriously and sending regiments of riot cops to hold them one takes them seriously
earlier cartoons of mohammed depictions that are deplored by muslims spurred protests and the burning of the magazine's office three years ago
in november two thousand and eleven the office caught fire the day charlie hebdo was due to publish a cover poking fun at islamic law
it's an indescribable mess charbonnier told cnn at the time
everything has melted
the keyboards the computers
everything is dead
ashes cover all of our belongings
a year later in an interview with le monde newspaper charbonnier gave no indication there were any plans to change charlie hebdo
it may sound pompous he said but i'd rather die standing than live on my knees
his death and those of others who worked with him spurred a wave of support for the publication in france and around the world
on social media a trend emerged of people tweeting past covers from the magazine as well as the words je suis charlie or i am charlie
in september two thousand and twelve as france was closing embassies in about twenty countries amid the global furor over the anti islam film innocence of muslims the magazine published an issue featuring a cartoon that appeared to depict a naked mohammed along with a cover that appeared to show mohammed being pushed in a wheelchair by an orthodox jew
charlie hebdo journalist laurent leger defended the magazine at the time saying the cartoons were not intended to provoke anger or violence
the aim is to laugh leger told bfmtv in two thousand and twelve
we want to laugh at the extremists every extremist
they can be muslim jewish catholic
everyone can be religious but extremist thoughts and acts we can not accept
in france we always have the right to write and draw
and if some people are not happy with this they can sue us and we can defend ourselves
that's democracy leger said
you don't throw bombs you discuss you debate
but you don't act violently
we have to stand and resist pressure from extremism
the weekly which was founded in one thousand nine hundred and seventy became renowned for its daring takedowns of politicians public figures and religious symbols of all faiths
after the slayings daniel leconte a filmmaker who was making a documentary about the cartoonists told the new york times that the cartoonists at charlie hebdo were like columnists in a very important journal
ecuadorian cartoonist xavier bonilla fifty said he got to know verlhac during seminars with cartooning for peace an international initiative created to promote tolerance through illustration
tignous was great at humor and had an easy manner about himself said bonilla
he strongly believed in freedom of the press something that becomes evident when you see his cartoons
he was a man who enjoyed freedom to its fullest in his artistic creativity and published his cartoons without fear
verlhac fifty eight was a contributor to the magazine sky news reported
bonilla recalled a reception he once attended with verlhac at the french embassy in bogota colombia
he asked about ten women to pose for him seated on a sofa he said
tignous took his time making a drawing of all of them posing
when he finally showed them the drawing they were not very pleased because it was a cartoon that didn't really make them look beautiful
he simply told them i drew them just like you look and that's how i see you 
then he laughed out loud
this was the kind of dark humor that was also evident in his cartoons
he was great at that
he was a great artist
leconte gave the new york times some insight into charbonnier's upbringing
he was raised by communists the filmmaker said and grew up to be a left wing activist
he has this education and this culture which was one part of his personality leconte told the newspaper but at the same time he was totally radical
showing cartoons of the prophet had nothing to do with religious ideology
rather charbonnier was driven by freedom liberte the filmmaker said
he was free man
he did not want to have obstructions in the way of thinking
he just wanted to express
freedom of speech
mexican cartoonist felipe galindo said he was a friend of wolinski who once presented him with an award
he was a great satirical artist galindo said
nothing was sacred for him
he would touch anything
but he was also a very gentle very kind man
wolinski eighty was reportedly born in tunisia to a french italian mother and a jewish father from poland
he began his career as a political cartoonist in one thousand nine hundred and sixty britain's sky news reported
galindo said wolinski who was on the magazine's editorial board and the other satirists lived following a french tradition of political cartooning about kings and napoleon and everything
they followed that tradition to an extreme
wolinski and the others were more concerned about possible retaliation against french citizens than themselves galindo said
they were very proud of their heritage and their country and freedom of expression he said
they were scapegoats
but the pen is mightier than the sword or guns in this case
this will enforce the idea of preserving our freedom of expression
under the instagram handle wolinskikiki a daughter of the cartoonist posted a photo her father's drawing table with the caption papa is gone not wolinski
cabut seventy six who contributed comic strips and caricatures to the magazine had his first illustrations published in paris newspapers in one thousand nine hundred and fifty four according to sky news
he studied art studies at the cole estienne
in two thousand and six he penned a controversial cartoon depicting mohammed that appeared on the cover of charlie hebdo sky news reported
london's daily mail described him as an almost legendary cultural figure in france
as the magazine's lead cartoonist cabut was reportedly the highest paid cartoonist in the world according to the independent
honore seventy three illustrated the cartoon featured on the last tweet on charlie hebdo's twitter feed wednesday morning
the cartoon is a drawing of al baghdadi the isis leader offering his best wishes for two thousand and fifteen
best wishes by the way the tweet reads
and health above all the terror leader is quoted as saying in the illustration signed by honore
maris also was a professor at the institute of european studies of the university of paris viii sky news reported
he also was a columnist and served as the magazine's deputy editor the international business times reported
merabet a member of the eleven th arrondissement police force who pursued the attackers was shot dead as he lay injured on the pavement according to french interior minister bernard cazeneuve
french media report that he was muslim
merabet was forty years old according to cazeneuve
brinsolaro forty nine was at the charlie hebdo offices as a protection officer for charbonnier
the daily mail reports that he was the married father of two children
brinsolaro's wife ingrid is the editor in chief of l'eveil normand a weekly news publication in the northwest of france according to a report from the french radio station tendance ouest the los angeles times said
he was a member of france's protection service which provides security for important people and institutions the los angeles times reported
brinsolaro held the rank of brigadier which is the same as a sergeant the newspaper said
the other four victims are as identified by didier guillaume a member the french senate
boisseau was a security guard who had worked for fifteen years in the building the new york times reported
he was on the first floor when the gunmen burst in spraying the lobby with gunfire
boisseau was killed as he sat at a welcome desk according to an interview with corrine rey a cartoonist at the magazine the times reported
cayat was the only woman killed le monde reported
she was a psychoanalyst and twice monthly columnist who wrote about a variety of subjects but focused on relationships the newspaper said
her column translated in english as the couch was popular among many
ourrad born in algeria was a copy editor for charlie hebdo
he moved to france twenty years ago and worked for several other publication before joining the magazine le monde reported
renaud the former chief of staff for the mayor of clermont ferrand was only visiting charlie hebdo on wednesday because he was returning some drawings that cartoonist cabut had lent to him for a travel book about clermont ferrand le monde said
renaud was invited to attend the staff editorial meeting where much of the bloodshed occurred

molly crabapple is an artist and writer
her memoir drawing blood will be published by harper collins in the fall
she has written for the new york times paris review and vanity fair and has work in the permanent collection of the museum of modern art
the opinions expressed in this commentary are hers
the artists of charlie hebdo join a long and tragic tradition
mocking pen strokes send authoritarians into paroxysm of rage
governments and extremist groups around the world target cartoonists for arrest beatings and execution
bullies can never take a joke
in two thousand and eleven masked gunmen broke the hands of syrian cartoonist ali ferzat as a warning to stop him from satirizing syrian president bashar al assad
in one thousand nine hundred and eighty seven palestinian cartoonist naji al ali creator of the character handala was killed outside his office in london
charlie hebdo was sometimes rank with a particularly french form of xenophobia
but the bravery of charbonnier and his staff in the face of death threats and firebombings was something to marvel at
i mourn my fellow artists
i hope perhaps futilely that their murders will not be used to justify a backlash on the muslims in france
though i'm an atheist i say a small prayer
for irreverence for love and for art

though we're told to regard the charlie hebdo massacre in paris as a story with relevance that transcends national boundaries from a north american perspective it's hard to understand its context as anything but impenetrably foreign
we can certainly empathize with the tragedy and the monstrous senseless slaughter of a dozen inspiring lives but as an episode of political and cultural significance 
its characteristics are decidedly exotic
part of this is due to the fact that the united states and canada possess no muslim population comparable to that of europe
the rising european impulse to push back against islam in this case through vulgar cartoons that incessantly insulted the faith its followers and prophet can appear weirdly chauvinistic even petty
north america also lacks a satirical culture of the sort charlie hebdo embodied in which vulgar insults are understood to be the appropriate language of comedic commentary
cartoonists in north america increasingly do not see themselves as avant garde provocateurs for whom no subject is beyond reproach but rather as cautious advocates for a particular strain of progressive tolerance
the cartoonists i know fret endlessly about committing sins of sexism racism and various other isms of intolerance in their art and stories
they worry about drawing obama's lips too big and female characters waists too narrow not who they can get to hate them
the paris killing raises an uneasy question
to what extent proponents of a free press should continue to needle an unpopular but vindictive minority 
it's a question increasingly irrelevant to an american culture ever more prone to aggressive self censorship in the name of preserving the delicate sensibilities of the easily outraged
i do not think much of those on this side of the atlantic who are posturing so heroically in support of a right they've shown little interest in exercising themselves

hayat boumeddiene a twenty six year old woman allegedly was the accomplice of amedy coulibaly thirty two in a hostage taking incident at a kosher grocery store in eastern paris

the gunmen asked maintenance men where the magazine office was and opened fire killing one of the workers
they made their way to the office on the second floor and headed to the newsroom opening fire again killing ten people this time
the staff of the magazine which is published each wednesday was in a lunchtime editorial meeting when the gunmen burst in
hebdo's editor and a police officer who was in charge of protecting him were among those killed
the gunmen asked for specific people by name before killing them said a doctor who helped the injured
dr. gerald kierzek said the gunmen divided the men from the women before opening fire
the shooting was not a random spray of bullets he said but more of a precision execution
the gunmen left the building and drove off with a third suspect encountering and exchanging fire with police three times
a second police officer was shot and killed in the final exchange
what we don't know
investigators are still working on what happened inside the office of charlie hebdo
the attack appeared highly organized down to a detailed getaway plan
it's not yet clear if the gunmen had help
several detentions took place overnight in connection with the shootings prime minister manuel valls said thursday without specifying how many
what we know
the two brothers accused of carrying out the charlie hebdo attack cherif kouachi and said kouachi are dead
so is grocery store suspect amedy coulibaly authorities said
those three men were part of the same same jihadist groups disant said
paris prosecutor francois molins said cherif kouachi's wife and the girlfriend of amedy coulibaly boumedienne exchanged five hundred phone calls in two thousand and fourteen
furthermore the wife told investigators that her husband and coulibaly knew each other very well
the prime minister said thursday that the suspects were known to the security services
both brothers were in the u.s. database of known or suspected international terrorists known as tide and also had been on the no fly list for years a u.s. law enforcement official said
cherif kouachi thirty two was convicted in two thousand and eight of being part of a jihadist recruitment ring in paris that sent fighters to the war in iraq
a french source close to the french security services said that investigators are looking at evidence to suggest that cherif went to syria and that he returned from this trip of unknown length to france in august two thousand and fourteen
usa today reported that both brothers returned from syria in the summer
less is publicly known about said kouachi thirty four
but cnn affiliate bfmtv reported that his id card was discovered during the investigation into the attack helping police single out the suspects
according to u.s. officials said spent several months in mid two thousand and eleven in yemen receiving weapons training and working with al qaeda's affiliate there al qaeda in the arabian peninsula
this would place him in yemen during the time that senior figure anwar al awlaki was still alive
al awlaki was killed in september two thousand and eleven in a u.s. drone strike
while it's not absolutely definitive the united states believes it's likely and possible that said kouachi and awlaki crossed paths but it's not known if they would have met for any extended period of time
a third suspect in the charlie hebdo attack hamyd mourad eighteen turned himself in to police wednesday a source close to the case told the news agency agence france presse
but french media outlets reported his release saturday
reports in french media and on social platforms suggested he was at school in northeastern france at the time of the attack
some experts warned that how well the gunmen in the attack wielded their weapons hid their identities and apparently planned their escape showed a marked difference form other lone wolf attacks
writing for cnn retired lt. gen. mark hertling former commander of u.s. army europe wrote that the gunmen appeared well trained
as for coulibaly a western intelligence source told cnn that he went by the alias doly gringny
the source said he was a close associate of cherif kouachi
the two were involved in a two thousand and ten attempt to free an algerian serving time for the one thousand nine hundred and ninety five subway bombing the source said
coulibaly was arrested in may two thousand and ten with two hundred and forty rounds of ammunition for a kalashnikov rifle
he also had a photo of himself with djamel beghal a french algerian once known as al qaeda's premiere european recruiter who was convicted of conspiring to attack the u.s. embassy in paris
coulibaly was indicted in the prison break plot but there was not enough evidence to charge cherif kouachi the source said
cherif kouachi visited coulibaly during pre trial detention
coulibaly lived with boumeddiene the source said
the two traveled to malaysia together
a man claiming to be amedy coulibaly told cnn affiliate bfmtv on friday that he belonged to the islamist militant group isis
what we don't know
were the suspects working with anyone else 
and were their attacks directed by terrorist networks 
the fbi and u.s. intelligence agencies are mapping their relationships for clues including digital records
they are also running the suspects names through databases and looking for connections with isis and al qaeda
an isis radio broadcast thursday praised the attackers calling them brave jihadists
but the broadcast did not say whether the two had any connection to the militant group
the victims in the charlie hebdo attack
what we know
at least twelve people were killed in the attack including police officers and some of the most revered and controversial cartoonists in france
charlie hebdo editor stephane charb charbonnier was among the dead
at least seven other journalists were killed including well known cartoonists georges wolinski who worked under the pen name wolinski jean cabu cabut bernard tignous verlhac and philippe honore known as honore
also killed was journalist economist and charlie hebdo shareholder bernard maris bfmtv reported
a maintenance man and two police officers also died according to authorities
the two police officers killed were identified as ahmed merabet and franck brinsolaro
eleven people were wounded in the attack including four in serious condition
what we don't know
all the victims have been identified but over time more stories of these lives cut tragically short by terrorism are likely to emerge
what we know
during the charlie hebdo attack the gunmen said allahu akbar which translates to god is great and that they were avenging the prophet mohammed the prosecutor told reporters
charlie hebdo has a controversial history of depicting mohammed often in an unfavorable light which has angered many muslims around the world
earlier cartoons depicting mohammed spurred protests and the burning of the magazine's office three years ago
its last tweet before wednesday's attack featured a cartoon of isis leader abu bakr al baghdadi offering festive greetings with the words and above all health
president francois hollande described the kosher grocery story attack as an anti semitic act
what we don't know
was the charlie hebdo attack part of a coordinated strategy 
was coulibaly working with the kouachi brothers or did he simply respond to their attack by launching his own 
were his attacks opportunistic or planned in advance 

at a press conference friday marie paule kieny who leads the who ebola vaccine work suggested there has been real promise offered from initial tests of two of the vaccines being studied
one comes from merck and newlink and the other is licensed by glaxosmithkline
both vaccines have an acceptable safety profile meaning there are no adverse affects that would keep it from being tested in a broader population
trials of the vaccines in africa should start soon
health care workers will be among some of the first volunteers to be a part of this next stage of the test
earlier the trial of the vaccine made by merck and newlink were stopped in december after some of the volunteers in the trial had transient mild joint pain
after investigating that side effect scientists concluded it was not a big enough issue to stop the development of the vaccine
no similar side effects were noted in the other vaccine trial
there are other ebola vaccines being tested by companies in the united states and in russia
while the ebola epidemic seems to be slowing people are still dying infections continue
to date there have been nineteen thousand three hundred and forty cases with seven thousand five hundred and eighteen deaths in the countries most impacted by the epidemic according to the latest who report

the hashtag jesuischarlie i am charlie became an international rallying point for people expressing solidarity with the victims of the slaughter carried out by gunmen at the offices of the french satirical magazine charlie hebdo on wednesday
but another hashtag jesuisahmed has become a poignant way of honoring ahmed merabet a forty year old police officer who was killed by the terrorists
during the massacre at the charlie hebdo offices the gunmen claimed that they were avenging the prophet mohammed by attacking a magazine that had repeatedly lampooned islam and other religions
but by killing merabet they took the life of a man who was reported to be a muslim
like the parents of the two main suspects in the attack merabet's mother and father are believed to have moved to paris from north africa
i am not charlie i am ahmed the dead cop
charlie ridiculed my faith and culture and i died defending his right to do so wrote the twitter user dyab abou jahjah
by friday morning paris time his tweet using the jesuisahmed hashtag had been retweeted more than seventeen thousand times
many more tributes to merabet poured in on the hashtag
alongside it some people tweeted a quote attributed to the french philosopher voltaire
i do not agree with what you have to say but i'll defend to the death your right to say it
others simply said thank you to the fallen officer
it was his job it was his duty 
even before merabet's name and background became public many people knew how he died because of a widely circulated video from wednesday's attack
he was on patrol near the charlie hebdo offices when the attackers burst out
he was on foot and came nose to nose with the terrorists
he pulled out his weapon
it was his job it was his duty rocco contento a police union representative told the guardian
the video from the scene shows merabet twisting in pain on the ground after already being shot once
as the gunmen move toward him he raises his hands indicating surrender
french media reported that one of the gunmen asked the wounded officer do you want to kill us 
merabet is heard in the video crying out no
it's ok boss
that's when one of the gunmen shoots him at point blank range in the head
contento described merabet as a quiet conscientious man likable and always smiling
a photo shows him grinning into the camera
he had a girlfriend according to contento
merabet had reportedly been a police officer for eight years assigned to the eleven th arrondissement where the attack took place
he was working as a bicycle cop but french newspaper le figaro reported that he'd recently qualified to become a detective
merabet wasn't the only police officer killed in the attack
the other was franck brinsolaro who had been assigned to protect stephane charb charbonnier the editor of charlie hebdo for the past several years according to le figaro
brinsolaro forty eight was killed inside the magazine's offices with charbonnier and other cartoonists
le figaro reported that the police officer had just got married to a woman with whom he had a one year old daughter
the whole of france needs to take action said brinsolaro's twin brother philippe according to the newspaper
you can't attack freedom of expression and the authority of the state like that
on social media franck brinsolaro like ahmed and the staff of charlie was also being remembered through the hashtag jesuisfranck



the attack wednesday on the charlie hebdo offices in paris touched off three days of terror in france as authorities staged an intensive hunt for the suspects
on friday security forces killed two suspects in the magazine attack who were holed up in a building north of paris
at the same time security forces stormed a kosher grocery store in paris where a man suspected of killing a police officer had taken hostages
the suspect was killed and four hostages were found dead while others fled safely
about eleven thirty a.m. wednesday according to the french newspaper le monde gunmen dressed in black and wearing bulletproof vests forced their way into a building two doors down from charlie hebdo asking where to find the magazine
they then headed to the correct building where they killed an officer on security detail officials said
they later encountered a charlie hebdo cartoonist who was on her way out of the building and demanded she lead them to the offices
once there she was told to enter a security code to open its fortified door according to the newspaper
the gunmen barged in during a lunchtime editorial meeting separating men and women and calling out the names of employees they intended to kill said dr. gerald kierzek a physician who treated wounded patients and spoke with survivors
he described the gunfire as a precision execution
the gunmen said they were avenging the prophet mohammed and shouted allahu akbar which translates to god is great paris prosecutor francois molins said
some workers managed to flee to the rooftop and record video as the attackers left and fired on police
a short time later the gunmen opened fire as a police car blocked their way
more than a dozen bullets were shot into the patrol car
the attackers escaped
the gunmen drove a few more blocks before encountering an officer along a parisian boulevard
they executed him on the sidewalk
in all twelve people died the attack
thousands of parisians took to the streets wednesday night and held a defiant vigil for the victims
social media responded to the terrorist attack with je suis charlie or i am charlie
the show of solidarity with paris and the satirical newspaper went viral in a multitude of languages
late wednesday one suspect in the attack eighteen year old hamyd mourad turned himself in to police a source close to the case told the afp news agency
he did so after seeing his name mentioned on social media the source said
heavily armed police fanned out across the country overnight searching for the two other suspects in the attack who would be later identified as cherif kouachi and said kouachi brothers known to french and international intelligence
as that search was ongoing people dressed similarly to those in the charlie hebdo attack all in black and wearing bulletproof vests shot a female police officer in the paris suburb of montrouge
she later died
meanwhile in northern france a gas station attendant near villers cotterets reported the kouachi brothers stole food and gas from the business leading to a massive manhunt there
armed officers some in helmets and carrying shields searched fields and forests as helicopters with night vision optics buzzed overhead
french prime minister manuel valls raised the terror alert level in the picardy region to the highest level as it became the focal point in the search
police and french special forces troops surrounded a building in dammartin en goele about forty kilometers from villers cotterets believing the kouachi brothers were inside
a member of france's parliament told french channel itele the two suspects told police they wanted to die as martyrs
many area schools were placed on lockdown shops were told to close and residents were told to stay inside the mayor's media office said
a new front in the crisis opened friday afternoon when a gunman entered a kosher store in the paris suburb of porte de vincennes taking people hostage according to a police union spokesman
the gunman is believed to be the same man accused of shooting the police officer thursday in montrouge alliance police union spokesman pascal disant said
in dammartin en goele the move by security forces on the building where the kouachi brothers were hiding ended with both men dead according to district mayor bernard corneille
in the supermarket standoff suspected hostage taker amedy coulibaly was killed in the operation and some police officers were injured disant said
four hostages were killed and fifteen survived according to israeli government sources who characterized a phone conversation between israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu and french president franois hollande
coulibaly's suspected accomplice twenty six year old hayat boumeddiene escaped as hostages ran from the store disant said
al qaeda in the arabian peninsula claimed responsibility for orchestrating the attack on charlie hebdo the founder of the magazine the intercept jeremy scahill told cnn
cnn has not independently confirmed this claim

they were trying to get into the building
moments later the massacre erupted in the offices of satirical magazine charlie hebdo feet away from boudot he told cnn's anderson cooper
we heard the first shots and then more and more shots right across the whole five or six minutes
and they heard screams said boudot who is a documentarian
they ran for the roof while their minds raced through possible dangers
we knew that there were victims a few meters away from us but there might be you know some explosives somewhere or maybe a third guy boudot said
in the offices of charlie hebdo the masked gunmen dressed in black apparently barged in on a conference
survivors later told their stories to a doctor who treated them
he relayed them to cnn
the gunman separated the men from the women and called out names of cartoonists
then they fired
not randomly spraying bullets but taking professional precise aim
they left the building and cell phone video captured them as they ran in the street and kept firing
one of the masked men ran over to a man in uniform lying apparently wounded on the sidewalk and shot him at close range
the two said they were avenging the prophet mohammed and shouted allahu akbar which translates to god is great a french official said
video shows a gunman approaching his black getaway car and raising his finger
perhaps it was a signal
when the gunfire ceased boudot and his colleagues went back into the building
they couldn't have been too surprised that the satire magazine had been attacked
threats against it had been widely reported
charlie hebdo's previous offices had been fire bombed three years before the day it was to publish a provocative cover lampooning the muslim prophet mohammed
they moved to their current office a year ago paul moreira who works in the building told cnn's erin burnett
the magazine refused to change anything and kept publishing irreverent cartoons on islam but also on christianity judaism politics and society in its usual profane style
charlie hebdo's editor cartoonist stephane charbonnier charb for short was on an al qaeda target list
the gunmen killed him as they did three other famous cartoonists known by the pen names cabu wolinski and tignous
he was always accompanied by one or two secret service officers
everywhere we went for the last four years
at day and at night so he was protected he said
de vries thinks one of those killed was a body guard
in the meeting room boudot saw bodies lying off to the left
survivors were either hiding or standing
they were just standing like not zombies but they were standing and didn't do anything he said
we tried to help the very first one but actually to be honest there were not a lot of wounded they were just people dead all around
but the gunman had not only killed in the meeting room
moreira made his way to charlie hebdo's offices as well
the first thing he saw was the body of a building doorman
this grumpy guy we liked and appreciated
he was lying down in his blood and he was dead
he had been shot by the gunners
blood stained the stairways where heavily wounded people lay
a man moreira knew for twenty years had been shot in each leg
moreira went up to the cartoonists offices
witnesses huddled with survivors
they were in one room some crying hysterical
some were like prostrated and not capable of saying anything saying a word moreira said
the gunmen had shot dead eight of their colleagues as well as a guest the doorman and two police officers
on thursday businesses around the corner in the trendy inner city neighborhood reopened cafes filled with patrons and traffic congested streets
aside from a covey of journalists satellite trucks the only sign of the carnage a day earlier was a tribute taped to a tree
a bouquet of roses and a quote by a french philosopher
it read there is only one step from fanaticism to barbarism

aleppo has somehow sometime between late two thousand and twelve when it was the open sore of the syrian civil war and today when the fight against isis has completely grabbed the world's attention span slipped off the radar screen
but here is why it must not
there remain an estimated three hundred thousand civilians there in rebel held areas alone
these are people who suffer any one or all of the following litany of afflictions daily
barrel bombs randomly dropped crudely made devices intended to maim kill and terrify
warring rebel militia also fighting with the regime
radical islamic groups
shortages of food and water
people cutting down whatever trees they can find for fuel
and above all a sense for months now of hopelessness that their world has only worsened since the fight for aleppo began in june two thousand and twelve
that their fight has been deemed by some to be so incurable and intractable that the outside world has left aleppo to its own devices willing to help the winner but not to assist a victory
aleppo is the greatest prize in the fight for syria's north but also its greatest victim
aleppo the biggest city its commercial hub its cultural heart is a skeleton of what stood proudly merely three years ago
it is very difficult to gain independent access to aleppo
you can count on one hand the number of western tv channels who have done so in the past year
cnn last entered in june for six hours
kidnapping is now the major hazard
after months of hospitality and risking themselves to assist journalists rebels now find their ranks bedevilled by radicals and criminals who see foreign media often as a form of currency to help with boosting funds or dealing with another scourge
isis
there are a few exceptions who through luck of contacts manage to evade the various hazards
brazilian photojournalist gabriel chaim managed to spend a month in aleppo with some of the more moderate rebel groups
they provided him access to their world
access to a school hidden away in a house where children still learn english
to an artist who commemorates the war's dead with paintings he etches out in a cave underground that also serves as a bomb shelter
and to the front lines where the battle for syria's largest city is being fought with a desperation not seen before
chaim gained access to one key battle currently under way
and as in so much of syria's war it has been that way for months and will probably go on so as the outcome is so vital that nobody is prepared to give up
the fight for a small hill called handarat
the hill and its associated settlement lies to the northeast of aleppo city on a vital road into the rebel held areas
the regime has a strong presence to its west and has been pushing up to the east for the past weeks
daily hourly they push towards this raised bit of geography which if it were to fall into their control would allow them to shell the only roads in and out of rebel held areas effectively denying the rebels and the civilians who live among them their use
then many fear the siege of aleppo would begin
the regime has tried this tactic dubbed starve or surrender before namely in homs
they besiege an area deny its fighters and civilians food medicine everything
eventually the regime presents a deal
leave or surrender
the fear is that the fall of handarat might present a similar opportunity for the regime
and then the humanitarian catastrophe currently brewing inside rebel areas would mushroom
hanaa singer a spokesperson for unicef says the situation this winter in aleppo is very desperate regardless whether areas are control of the government control or armed opposition groups
waterborne diseases continue to spread partly because often as many as fifty to seventy displaced people share the same toilet
there is no electricity or fuel for heating which leaves many people with the only choice of cutting trees from the public spaces and use them to heat the houses she says adding the situation is even harder for the displaced as many live in unfinished buildings or collective shelters where they have no windows doors or even walls
unicef estimates that sixty five thousand families risk being cut off from any assistance should the regime take handarat hill that's about three hundred thousand people
another one hundred thousand children simply need warm clothes for this winter singer adds
that is around aleppo alone
this is the nightmare of being caught between a regime trying to besiege them on one side and on the other the evil of isis trying to impose their radical worldview

the tragic murder of cpl
nathan cirillo by michael zehaf bibeau a recent convert to islam as every media outlet in the united states would like to remind you has added fuel to the already fiery debate in this country over the inherently violent nature of religion in general and islam in particular
it seems that in the minds of many the only possible reason a muslim convert would go on a shooting spree in the canadian parliament is because his religious beliefs commanded him to do so
of course it could very well be the case that zehaf bibeau was motivated by his islamic beliefs
it could be that he read a particular passage in the quran understood it to mean he should kill as many canadian government officials as possible and then went out and did just that
after all there's no question that a person's religious beliefs can and often do influence his or her behavior
the mistake lies in assuming there is a necessary and distinct causal connection between belief and behavior that bibeau's actions were exclusively the result of his religious beliefs
the notion that there is a one to one correlation between religious beliefs and behavior may seem obvious and self evident to those unfamiliar with the study of religion
but it has been repeatedly debunked by social scientists who note that beliefs do not causally explain behavior and that behavior is in fact the result of complex interplay among a host of social political cultural ethical emotional and yes religious factors
in the case of bibeau his violent behavior could have been influenced as much by his religious beliefs as by his documented mental problems his extensive criminal past or his history of drug addiction
yet because bibeau was a muslim it is simply assumed that the sole motivating factor for his abhorrent behavior was his religious beliefs
indeed there's even a term for this idea
sudden jihad syndrome an imaginary contagion invented by the neo conservative commentator daniel pipes to describe how any normal seeming muslim can suddenly snap for no reason at all and go on a murderous rampage
strangely this causal connection between belief and behavior seems not to be as aggressively applied if the criminal in question claims a different religion than islam
take the example of the norwegian terrorist anders breivik who slaughtered seventy seven people the majority of them children in two thousand and eleven
breivik explicitly defined himself as a christian warrior fighting what he called an existential conflict with islam
nevertheless a great deal of the media coverage surrounding his actions seemed to take for granted that his crime had nothing to do with his christian identity that it was based instead on his right wing ideology or his anti immigrant views or his neglectful upbringing or even as ayan hirshi ali famously argued because his view that europe will be overrun by islam was being censored by a politically correct media leaving him no other choice but to use violence
all of the above explanations for breivik's behavior including his religious beliefs are pertinent in understanding the motivations for his behavior
but to argue that breivik's or bibeau's actions were motivated solely by their religious beliefs or that their religious beliefs necessarily dictated their actions is simply irrational
and yet this trope has become exceedingly common among some critics of religion
take the following excerpt from the bestselling book the end of faith by the anti theist activist sam harris
the link between belief and behavior raises the stakes considerably
some propositions are so dangerous that it may even be ethical to kill people for believing them
this may seem an extraordinary claim but it merely enunciates an ordinary fact about the world in which we live
certain beliefs place their adherents beyond the reach of every peaceful means of persuasion while inspiring them to commit acts of extraordinary violence against others
there is in fact no talking to some people
if they can not be captured and they often can not otherwise tolerant people may be justified in killing them in self defense
harris argument is that a person's religious beliefs do not merely influence his or her behavior
they determine it
in other words people holding certain beliefs should be killed not because those beliefs may lead to violent behavior but because they necessarily will
therefore in order to save ourselves we may be justified in killing the believer before his or her beliefs turn into action as they inevitably will
it is true that religious beliefs can often lead to actions that violate basic human rights
it is also true that a great many of those actions are taking place right now among muslims
but it is ridiculous to claim that the actions of islamic extremists are either necessarily or exclusively the result of their belief in islam
there may be millions of muslims who share the ultra orthodox puritanical strain of islam called salafism that fuels the members of isis
but the u.s. is not at war with salafism
it is at war with isis and not because of what they believe but because of the actions they have carried out based on their interpretation of those beliefs
arguing otherwise leads to the preposterous conclusion that anyone who shares any measure of religious beliefs with a violent extremist is equally guilty for that extremist's violent actions regardless of how diverse the interpretations of those beliefs may be
in fact harris makes this exact point
given the link between belief and action it is clear that we can no more tolerate a diversity of religious beliefs than a diversity of beliefs about epidemiology and basic hygiene
the danger of this mistaken view of the link between belief and action is that it makes it that much more difficult to counter religious violence
when we condemn an entire community of faith for sharing certain beliefs with extremists in their community we end up alienating the very people who are best positioned to counter such extremism in the first place
people should be free to believe whatever they want to believe no matter how irrational those beliefs may appear to us just as people should be free to criticize those beliefs
it is when such beliefs lead to violent behavior that people of all faiths as well as those of no faith should unite in condemnation


badawi was sentenced to ten years in prison one thousand lashes and a fine of one million saudi arabian riyals in may two thousand and fourteen by a saudi court accusing him of insulting islam said his wife and a source who followed the case closely
a respected rights activist in saudi arabia badawi first got into legal trouble with the saudi government after he started the free saudi liberals website in two thousand and eight which included a forum for users to discuss religion
his trial guilty verdict sentence and imprisonment have raised outrage among international rights groups such as human rights watch and amnesty international which accused saudi authorities of cracking down on activism and attempting to suppress dissent in the ultraconservative nation
human rights groups accuse saudi authorities of targeting activists through the courts and travel bans
amnesty international has said badawi's is clear case of intimidation against him and others who seek to engage in open debates about the issues that saudi arabians face in their daily lives
badawi will receive his first fifty of one thousand lashes on friday following prayers in front of al jafali mosque in jeddah
the rest of the one thousand lashes will be carried out over a period of twenty weeks
amnesty international considers badawi a prisoner of conscience and is calling for his sentence to be quashed and for him to be released immediately and unconditionally
the news that raif badawi's flogging will start tomorrow is shocking said philip luther director of amnesty international middle east and north africa
in two thousand and thirteen badawi was originally sentenced to seven years in prison and six hundred lashes in relation to the charges but after an appeal the judge stiffened the punishment
following his arrest his wife and children left the kingdom for canada
it is horrifying to think that such a vicious and cruel punishment should be imposed on someone who is guilty of nothing more than daring to create a public forum for discussion and peacefully exercising the right to freedom of expression said luther
cnn was unable thursday to reach saudi arabia's justice ministry for comment
the u.s. state department said it was concerned about the flogging and sentence imposed on badawi for exercising his rights to freedom of expression and religion
the united states government calls on saudi authorities to cancel this brutal punishment and to review badawi's case and sentence state department spokeswoman jen psaki said in a statement
the united states strongly opposes laws including apostasy laws that restrict the exercise of these freedoms and urges all countries to uphold these rights in practice



an indonesian search vessel had earlier detected the pings said gen. moeldoko the head of indonesia's armed forces
he was speaking on board the ship that is being used as a base for divers trying to raise the tail of the airasia plane which went down in the java sea on december twenty eight with one hundred and sixty two people on board
but there is also caution surrounding the possible pings because the sound could be emanating from other sources
in the case of malaysia airlines flight mh three hundred and seventy several signals raised hopes of locating the missing plane but proved to be false leads
search teams which had been battling bad weather and strong currents found the tail section on the sea floor wednesday
that discovery was seen as significant because in the airbus a three hundred and twenty two hundred the aircraft model of flight qz eight thousand five hundred and one the flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder are housed in the tail
but before friday searchers hadn't reported detecting any possible pings from the locator beacons on the flight recorders which are popularly known as black boxes
it was unclear whether the devices remained inside the tail or had come free
batteries that send out the pings last thirty days
it has been thirteen days since the airasia plane fell into the sea
conditions cleared up friday as divers prepared for a complicated operation to raise the tail to find the recorders
divers are lowering ropes and slings down to the tail
the plan is to inflate giant airbags or balloons underneath to lift the tail from the bottom of the sea
a crane would then be used to raise the section
search officials said that the underwater visibility and currents are much better than conditions in previous days
experts say the information contained within the flight recorders is likely to enable investigators to figure out why flight qz eight thousand five hundred and one dropped off radar and went down in the sea on its way from the indonesian city of surabaya to singapore
the plane's pilot had asked to change course and climb to a higher altitude minutes before contact was lost according to indonesian officials
the vast majority of the people on the plane were indonesian
there were also citizens of great britain france malaysia singapore and south korea
a total of forty eight bodies have so far been recovered from the sea indonesia's search and rescue agency said friday
some of the bodies have been found still strapped into seats

jaycee chan who pleaded guilty to hosting others to take drugs was also fined two thousand yuan announced the dongcheng district people's court
wearing a black sweatshirt and blue pants the thirty two year old chan who is an actor like his father bowed to the judge and prosecutor after the ninety minute trial
i committed a crime and deserve to be punished the court's official microblog quoted him as saying
it doesn't mean i have received mercy and forgiveness i hope to earn them with my future actions
reminding him to return to the right path and establish a healthy public image the prosecutor cited chan's cooperation with police as a basis for leniency according to the court
the hong kong native was arrested in beijing last summer along with a taiwanese actor amid a government crackdown on celebrity drug offenders
after both men tested positive for marijuana police found more than one hundred grams of the drug after searching chan's apartment
although he did not attend the trial jackie chan who has starred in hollywood blockbusters like rush hour and was named an anti drugs ambassador in china in two thousand and nine had expressed anger and disappointment in his son in media interviews
i failed to discipline him now the state is helping me discipline him and make him get rid all the bad habits the elder chan sixty told the state run xinhua news agency last month while denying his son had received special treatment in jail
the younger chan's case has put a spotlight on the chinese capital's intensifying anti drugs campaign
by mid november the authorities had detained almost ten thousand people for using drugs nearly double the previous year's figure
announcing the numbers a top anti narcotics official in beijing emphasized the government's zero tolerance stance on celebrity offenders due to the impact of their behavior on the youth
last august dozens of management agencies representing actors and singers signed an agreement with beijing authorities banning drug use from the entertainment industry and pledging to fire any artists who break the law

the idea of the essay is to drive the audience into a war environment quintao said about his front row project
the shades of gray with a lot of contrast associated with the dramatic faces and the desperate acts of the crowd gave me the drama i wanted
indeed the images he captures depict the agony and frustration someone might feel in conflict
but amid the pain there is also joy and excitement as music lovers get a taste of something most people at a concert do not
quintao's photographs from the rock in rio festival in rio de janeiro are up close personal and intimate
the festival is one of the largest music concerts in the world and has brought together some of the most popular acts of their time
queen prince elton john katy perry and more recently beyonce bruce springsteen and metallica
it draws hundreds of thousands of fans from all over the world to see and hear their favorite acts
but for some people it is the chance to show the performers how they feel about them
i realized that people who stay at the first row in these situations don't want just to listen to the music better or to see their idol closer quintao said
they want to prove love to the person on the stage and to prove to themselves that they're brave
the thirty year old photographer from sao paulo brazil said the crowds who press forward during the music festival is mostly younger and male
however there is a woman he thinks is in her sixty s who is ever present at many of the venues and somehow makes her way to the first row
from quintao's photos it might appear that the action on the stage is secondary to the rush in the crowd
quintao trains his camera on what he believes is the most unpredictable places to get the most emotional images at the events
sometimes the artist behind the microphone just doesn't move the light doesn't change and a few pictures already present what the gig was he said
but the front row is always unpredictable
it changes every time
people reaching their physical limit just to be as close as possible to their idol is much more interesting than the planned and controlled situation happening on the stage
the subjects of his lens have described themselves as proud to go through such pain for their musical adulation and they proclaim the front row is only for the real ones on the facebook page of his projects
people who face this situation until the end of the concert go home feeling they've received an honor medal for being strong quintao said
who wants to see the concert comfortably from an empty space 
while he's never seen a serious injury from his position in the pit the space between the stage and the crowd quintao hopes his photos do justice to the level of emotions portrayed in the name of fandom
he thinks the people in the front row believe they answer to a higher calling
the aim of this work is to show the power of fanaticism he said
i wanted to show how a rock concert can be similar to a religion cult where sometimes people submit themselves to suffering just to prove their love to their idol

just inside the western walls of the old city of jerusalem beneath the tall ottoman era fortification known misleadingly as the tower of david archaeologists this week proclaimed the discovery of the site of jesus trial by pontius pilate at which he was condemned to die by crucifixion
more accurately
they proclaimed the opening to visitors of the site which has now been excavated and prepared for public viewing
without pinpointing the precise location scholars have known for a long time that the trial must have taken place somewhere in this general vicinity despite the fact that tradition has put the spot of the trial on the very opposite side of the old city in the antonia fortress
according to the gospel of matthew jesus trial before pilate happened in a place called the praetorium
originally a term used to signify the tent of the general when encamped for war and thus the place where the important military decisions were made praetorium came to signify the palace or administrative center for very high ranking officials
in jerusalem this was the palace of herod the great and according to ancient witnesses it was at herod's palace that visiting roman prefects like pilate would hold any necessary trials during their visits to the capital city
these same ancient writers declared that herod's palace was in the western part of jerusalem near the tower of david
on these grounds scholars have long doubted indeed outright rejected the notion that the antonia fortress on the northeastern side of the city was where the praetorium was located and the trial occurred
this most recent announcement is being hailed as a blockbuster in large part because the antonia fortress is the first station of the cross on the via dolorosa the path that jesus is thought to have taken from his trial to his crucifixion and burial at golgotha ending at the church of the holy sepulchre
the via dolorosa is an important pilgrimage site and a massive tourist attraction
but if its first station is on the completely wrong side of the city then the whole thing is cast into doubt
the tower of david museum which is housing the exhibit of the newly discovered trial site is openly hoping to draw pilgrims and other interested visitors and it is certain to get them
what should not be overlooked however is that an important archaeological revelation about the life and death of jesus was effectively kept under wraps for nearly fifteen years the discovery of herod's palace beneath the tower of david was first made in two thousand and one as part of a museum expansion project
the timing of the announcement is linked entirely to the potential for tourist dollars rather than to the remarkable historical and religious significance of the discovery on its own terms
this may sound cynical but it is par for the course especially in jerusalem where the integration of history religion archeology and tourism is at the very heart of the city's economy
it is a safe bet that this discovery will not significantly diminish interest in walking the via dolorosa customs and traditions are awfully hard to break even with the best historical evidence
what is more likely to happen is that there will be two sites of jesus trial happily coexisting just as there are two sites of jesus burial
the church of the holy sepulchre and the garden tomb
jerusalem despite being riven by conflict remains one of the most religiously pluralistic places on earth and that pluralism is nowhere better exemplified than in the sharing duplicating and often just plain old creating of religious sites
from a scholarly perspective however it is nice that in this case the significance for the tourism industry of an archeological discovery really does match up with its significance in history
better fifteen years late than never

the hubble space telescope revisited the so called pillars of creation which the space agency describes as three giant columns of cold gas bathed in the scorching ultraviolet light from a cluster of young massive stars in a small region of the eagle nebula or m sixteen
the previous photo of these pillars taken in one thousand nine hundred and ninety five went on to stand out from all the rest of nasa's space images the agency said
the hubble image is so popular that it has appeared in movies and television shows on t shirts and pillows and even on a postage stamp
in celebration of the telescope's upcoming twenty five th anniversary in april hubble returned to the pillars and this time with the latest high definition tools
the new sharper and wider image was taken in near infrared light as well as visible light nasa said
the infrared view transforms the pillars into eerie wispy silhouettes seen against a background of myriad stars
that's because the infrared light penetrates much of the gas and dust except for the densest regions of the pillars
newborn stars can be seen hidden away inside the pillars
in one thousand nine hundred and ninety five the captured image gave insight into star formation
nebulous star forming regions like m sixteen are the interstellar neon signs that say we just made a bunch of massive stars here said paul scowen of arizona state university who helped lead the original observations in a post on nasa's website
the new image hints that these columns are also pillars of destruction nasa said
the ghostly bluish haze around the dense edges of the pillars is material getting heated up and evaporating away into space said scowen
we have caught these pillars at a very unique and short lived moment in their evolution

the high profile prosecution of rios montt who is accused of allowing the massacres of more than one thousand seven hundred indigenous ixil mayans in the early one thousand nine hundred and eighty s dates back to two thousand and twelve
he was convicted in may two thousand and thirteen a verdict that was overturned ten days later on procedural grounds
after genocide trial has justice been done 
a retrial which opened monday was characterized by the twists and delays that marked earlier proceedings
the accused did not show up in court
lawyers for rios montt argued that the eighty eight year old was too sick to attend the trial
rios montt has maintained since the beginning that he did not order the massacres
the three judge panel rejected the motion to delay the trial because of rios montt's health and ordered him to appear
rios montt eventually made his entrance strapped on a gurney covered with a blanket and wearing sunglasses
the presiding judge irma valdez called rios montt's absence unjustifiable according to the state run agn news agency
then she herself became the object of further complications
the former dictator's defense demanded that valdez recuse herself because of a thesis she wrote for a master's degree ten years ago
the topic of the paper 
a legal analysis of the crime of genocide as it relates to the atrocities committed during the period rios montt was in power
the defense argued that valdez had formed an opinion namely that genocide did occur in guatemala and therefore she could not be impartial
the judges agreed that valdez must recuse herself and now the trial is suspended until an appeals court can name a new judge
it's not controversial that a judge steps aside because of a conflict of interest but it may have been a legal strategy by rios montt's lawyers to wait until the first day of the trial to make their motion
valdez's thesis was no secret the thesis had been written about in the local press as early as two thousand and three
for observers the legal process against rios montt has been both historic and confounding at times
the indictment of rios montt by then attorney general claudia paz y paz was hailed by human rights groups
in guatemala like other latin american countries who lived through periods of violence and human rights violations at the hands of the government there were amnesty laws to protect those in power
the first trial against rios montt represented the first time that a former head of state was tried for genocide by his own nation's judicial system
the first trial was almost derailed several times
lawyers for rios montt lodged more than seventy motions and appeals many seeking to end the process on technical or procedural grounds
in the end the trial was completed and the guilty verdict came down
in a nation where the powerful and the political elite have historically been able to act with impunity the moment was big
ten days later however a higher court annulled the conviction and ordered a retrial a move critics considered politically motivated
some observers say they saw the invisible hand of the political elite at work when a court ordered paz y paz the attorney general who indicted rios montt to step down seven months before her term was to expire
shortly afterward the judge who handed down the guilty verdict against rios montt yassmin barrios was suspended by the guatemalan bar association for alleged ethics violations
there's no conclusive evidence that the actions against paz y paz and barrios are retaliation for their role in prosecuting guatemala's one time dictator but the sentiment among many is that this is exactly what happened
the first trial unearthed guatemala's complicated relationship with its own history as both protesters and supporters rallied outside the courtroom last year
rios montt came to power in a march one thousand nine hundred and eighty two coup only to be overthrown eighteen months later
during the trial prosecutors argued that rios montt's junta government oversaw the bloodiest period of the country's one thousand nine hundred and sixty one thousand nine hundred and ninety six civil war that left more than two hundred thousand people dead and one million refugees according to various truth commission reports

the statement doesn't so much roll off my tongue as it stumbles out of my mouth as i look at the scrappy tufts of feather on the leathery head of a marabou stork
others on the boat mutter similar sentiments
it's one of the ugly five says amos our captain and guide on an afternoon safari cruise at moremi game reserve in botswana's okavango river delta
his enthusiasm feels exaggerated for such a hideous bird
safaris tend to focus on the so called big five lions leopards buffalo rhinos elephants but the ugly five makes for a fun alternative for anyone who's already checked off the safari stars
the list runs like a cast call for the lion king's least majestic animals
marabou stork hyena vulture wildebeest and warthog
and we're here to meet them all
the marabou stork doesn't just rely on its looks it's also got a scent thing going down
they can grow up to five feet long says amos as we get close enough to see the scabby looking beak of one these large birds
and be glad it's not close enough that you can smell him
everyone except our guide cringes as the bird spreads its malodorous twelve foot wings and takes off from a tree giving us a full view of its underbelly and wrinkly throat sack
the okavango delta is one of two breeding grounds for the marabou stork
during mating season the birds are known to eat live prey including adult flamingos
the stork also goes by the name of the undertaker bird in recognition of the grim but important role it plays in the delta reducing diseases and cleaning up the ecosystem by devouring rotten carcasses
one the next morning's bush walk we get lucky in spotting a hyena
we're certainly luckier than the smelly dead animal it's devouring
your nose is the strongest tracker of game says amos
apparently your ears are the second but we're alerted to the hyena's presence not by its notorious cackling laugh but by the sound of the bones it's crunching
we peer over the brush to see a spotted hyena with its snout in the stomach of an impala
before anyone can ask our guide says
it probably didn't steal this meal from lions
hyenas are very successful hunters
the hyena registers low on the cuteness meter
this one couldn't get any more ugly unless it was covered in blood
which it is
my friend anja disagrees claiming that hyenas are so unattractive they're actually endearing
they're only ugly because they're villains in movies she says
showing me a photo of a hyena cub her sister took in south africa's kruger national park she adds the babies are so cute
that's debatable but they certainly get uglier with age
as we're watching our hyena pulls its bloody face out of the carcass revealing its elongated neck hunched gait and dirty scrappy fur
with one of the strongest jaws in the animal world hyenas don't leave much for scavengers
even so where there are carcasses there are usually vultures
while the marabou is the only species of stork on the list the entire vulture family can claim membership to the ugly club
circling overhead in a flying kettle the vultures we see aren't too bad to look at
their wings silhouette magnificently against the blue sky
the illusion is broken when a few fly down to compete with the hyena for impala meat revealing that though they have the wings of an eagle they have the face of freddy kruger
it's no surprise the bird's hooked beak and hunched stature have inspired a marvel comic villain
their ugliness is efficient says amos
the curved beak is effective in ripping meat according to our guide
the vulture's ugliest feature the featherless head and neck is easy to keep clean after eating carrion
esthetically it's the stuff of nightmares
the warthog is another case of practicality over prettiness
these wild pigs are plagued with useful but unappealing warts on both sides of their faces landing them firmly in the ugly crowd
the protuberances protect the faces of male warthogs when they fight even if they do look like surgery gone wrong
warthogs are plentiful in the okavango delta
anywhere out of scent range from carnivores we see warthog families digging for roots with their front knuckles
together with warts shaggy mohawks down their backs and uneven body hair the warthog is the least appealing pig in the delta
their bodies seem disproportionately stocky in comparison to their skinny legs and short necks
as we're watching a mother and two babies someone in our group steps on a twig and spooks them
we're treated to the beautiful sight of warthog butts with tails straight up in the air
during an afternoon heading out from the delta's moremi crossing resort in a mokoro dug out canoe we cross paths with the last of the ugly five
wildebeest
as we slosh from one end of the small herd to another a dozen weary black faces with straggly manes stare us down perhaps concerned we might try to eat them
because they're one of the most populous safari animals and not much to look at many people don't bother to photograph them says amos
as the unpretty cousin of the more elegant eland and gazelle the wildebeest is a peculiar genetic mishmash
it has the head of a buffalo body of an antelope and tail of a shaggy horse
its elongated face is connected to a dirty looking neck fringe and features a mouth shaped and used like a lawnmower
murky gray bodies decorated with black and white markings add to the unkempt appearance
its ugliness is no problem for mating they're practically blind amos laughs
the only way to get to moremi crossing is by small plane followed by a five minute boat ride
the guided cruise bush walk and mokoro rides are part of all inclusive packages for guests

the scottish spca is appealing for information on facebook after the male shar pei crossbreed was discovered friday night tied to a railing outside the ayr train station
beside him was a suitcase with some of the dog's belongings including a pillow toy a bowl and food
heart tugging photos of the forlorn dog attracted thousands of shares and sympathetic comments on social media with many people condemning his former owner
poor lad what a thing to do to him wrote one woman on facebook
i hope his future is brighter
spca inspector stewart taylor said the dog is microchipped allowing authorities to find out his name
kai
the spca contacted the owner registered to the microchip who said they had sold kai online in two thousand and thirteen but did not know the address of the person who bought him
this case highlights the potential consequences of selling an animal online as it often leads to the impulse buying of pets that people know very little about taylor said in a post on the scottish spca's website
regardless of the fact kai was left with his belongings this was still a cruel incident and we are keen to identify the person responsible
if anyone can help we would ask them to get in touch as soon as possible
a woman from aberdeenshire scotland told the daily record on friday that the dog's abandonment was the result of an attempted sale gone wrong
the woman said she responded to an online ad and agreed to buy the dog for about six hundred dollar but changed her mind once she arrived at the ayr train station to meet the seller
i went to buy a dog but the dog was not the same as the picture advertised she told the record
the seller then took off in his car leaving the pooch she said
the woman said she considered taking the dog home but panicked and left him tied to the railing because she had to catch the last train to aberdeen with her daughter who suffers from asthma
meanwhile the spca has been flooded with requests from people wanting to adopt the dog
taylor of the spca said kai is about two to three years old and is a lovely dog with a nice nature
we will look after him until we can find him a permanent and loving home
some people noted that kai's plight echoes that of paddington the fictional bear in a series of popular kids books who was adopted by a family after they found him sitting on his suitcase at paddington railway station in london
abandoning an animal is an offense under scotland's animal health and welfare act and anyone found guilty of doing so can expect to be banned from keeping animals for a fixed period or even life

the small airport serving the southwest england port city has emerged as the world's most punctual aviation hub in two thousand and fourteen outperforming some of the biggest destinations on the planet
with connections to europe and north africa bristol managed to get ninety four point four percents of its flights on or off the ground within fifteen minutes of schedule according to stats from uk based aviation data monitors oag
it's a figure that might discomfit officials at the main airports serving london including europe's busiest at heathrow none of which made the top rankings with the exception of london luton
that puts it top of the league not only for small airports but also larger facilities
john grant oag executive vice president says the findings of his company's first annual punctuality league were positive although many leading operators would probably be looking to up their game in two thousand and fifteen
with many airports and airlines achieving in excess of ninety percents on time performance within fifteen minutes of schedule there is a lot to celebrate he said
european destinations dominated the timekeeping list when it comes to small airports with bristol followed closely by brussels south charleroi airport at ninety three point one percents and berlin schoenefeld at ninety two point three percents
japan's osaka international airport claimed the top spot for medium sized airports with ninety three point two percents followed by moscow sheremetyevo and copenhagen airport
the most punctual large air hub was named as munich airport a fact that'll do little to dispel stereotypes of german efficiency but one that also highlights the five year delay to berlin's still unopened brandenburg airport
munich was followed by tokyo haneda at eighty seven point nine percents and seattle's sea tac airport at eighty six point two percents
the world's busiest air destination atlanta was ranked twelve th on the large airports list with a score of eighty two point four percents
dubai at fourteen th with eighty two point three percents was the only middle eastern airport to make any of the top twenties
in a week when it emerged that passengers spent twenty eight hours stuck on a delayed flight from abu dhabi to san francisco oag's rankings for the world's most punctual airlines makes interesting reading
smaller operations again took the lead with latvia's airbaltic outperforming all others at ninety four point nine percents
second and third were hawaiian airlines at ninety two point three percents and austrian airlines at ninety percents
the rest of the top ten includes
iberia klm saudi arabian airlines sas japan airlines finnair and alaska airlines
norwegian air shuttle was named the most punctual low cost carrier with almost nine out of ten flights sticking to schedule
it was followed by thai airasia and easyjet

dennis rodman belted out happy birthday not far from marilyn monroe's rendition as the pyongyang crowd clapped in unison during a basketball game
this year's birthday affairs are less likely to be bizarre rodman is not in town
kim's birthday is believed to fall on january eight but like most affairs of north korea his personal details are opaque
north korean state media has not acknowledged the exact date of kim's birth in either of its korean and english language archives
there is a lot of debate about the year he was born said cheong seong chang a senior research fellow at the sejong institute a korean think tank
some say it is one thousand nine hundred and eighty four while others say is eighty three or eighty two
in previous years kim has distributed sweets to children on january seven which was a tradition held by his grandfather and father during their birthdays
the birthday of kim il sung the founder of the country is considered the day of the sun and falls on april fifteen
kim jong il's birthday on february sixteen is known as the day of the shining star
these are the days when residents received goods from the state and children got sweets
the days are marked with pomp and circumstance including military parades patriotic chants and oaths of loyalty to the leaders
but the current leader kim's birthday has been decidedly more low key during his three years in power
there's a lot of speculation why that's the case said lee jung hoon professor of international relations at yonsei university in south korea
kim could be trying to put out this image as a humble guy that he's not extravagant
then there's sort of negative take on this issue as to he's still very young twenty nine thirty or thirty one
when you start marking his birthday then the whole north korean people will start to wonder then what's his age 
and revealing his age raises questions about experience
it could be because he is a young leader
being young could have its advantage and disadvantage but it appears as though he doesn't want to make it public yet said cheong
unlike his predecessors there's little sign that kim's birthday is a major national holiday
the kyodo news reported last year that the current north korean leader's birthday is not likely to be celebrated as a national holiday this year after it reviewed five north korean calendars for two thousand and fifteen
and north korean workers at the joint kaesong industrial complex never have asked for a holiday on january eight in the past two years according to the south korean unification ministry the agency which handles north korean affairs
his birth date was first revealed by kenji fujimoto the former sushi chef of kim's father kim jong il
the date is known as accurate but north korea never officially confirmed it said cheong
the unification ministry recorded kim's birthday as january eight although the exact year of birth is marked as one thousand nine hundred and eighty two one thousand nine hundred and eighty three or one thousand nine hundred and eighty four
in kim's three years in power he's largely followed the legacies of his father and grandfather said lee
a south korean report that released this week indicated that north korea could be closer to miniaturizing a nuclear warhead indicating that kim has continued with the focus on nuclear weapons
and his regime has also been marked by the purge of kim's uncle jang song thaek who was executed after being branded a traitor in december two thousand and thirteen
unfortunately there were some hopes because he was educated in switzerland and that he's young people hoped that there might be some change
none of that has happened
it might be worse because he's less experienced than his father and grandfather and very rash and impatient as we've seen with the cyberattacks lee said referring to a sony hacking scandal in which the fbi blamed north korea

editor's note
retired lt. gen. mark hertling former commander of u.s. army europe served in the army for more than thirty seven years and spent more than three years in iraq
he was the director for war plans on the joint staff on september eleven and has extensive experience in strategy development and implementation
he is a cnn military analyst
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author
the uniform
all the attackers are uniform in appearance
all have vests capable of holding multiple magazines of ammunition for their weapons and perhaps grenades
additionally they are all wearing what appear to be heavy coats
that could indicate either body armor or possibly suicide vests underneath to be detonated if captured
some experts are suggesting they came to kill not to die but those of us with experience in these kinds of encounters might suggest they came to kill until they are trapped then they will willingly die if they can kill more by detonating a suicide vest as a last resort
use of weapons
the terrorists were wielding ak forty seven s according to police spokesman xavier castaing but at least one of them also appeared to have a military three point sling attached to the weapon
these slings are used in close in attacks
the driver does not appear to have this strap which allows for freedom in the car
the attackers appear to be good marksmen as evidenced by the tight shot of a group of bullets that riddled the windshield of a french police car shown in several photographs at the scene
additionally the attackers have their weapons on semi automatic versus full automatic
many terrorists use what u.s. soldiers derisively call the pray and spray method
that is they point their weapons on full automatic scream a religious slogan and let loose with a stream of bullets most of which don't hit the targets
these terrorists appear well trained with aimed fire single shots and controlled targeting
fire and maneuver
these terrorists appear to have been trained in movement techniques
they use cover and aim fire while their terrorist buddy maneuvers to a new firing location
at that point the moving terrorist aims and fires while the previously covering terrorist moves to join him
reconnaissance
the attack occurred at noon in busy paris yet there was no traffic on the side streets where the citizens filming took place
additionally initial reports indicate that an editors meeting was occurring at that time with all the subjects in one room
that indicates there was intelligence route planning and then individual requirements for the members of the terrorist team
speed
they moved fast knew where they are going did their job and then they were gone
again that's indicative of rehearsals but also single mindedness of mission
selection of target
this was a follow on attack
the offices of charlie hebdo had been previously firebombed but that attack was not successful
much like the initial world trade center bombing in one thousand nine hundred and ninety three that was followed by the two thousand and one attack these terrorists were again going after the same target
usually terrorists film their attacks for future information operations and social media use
they may have had terrorist videographers in specific locations for that purpose during this attack as well
those videos may appear in the future but until then french citizens posting youtube videos contribute to the terrorists information campaign
in the next few hours and days other countries of europe especially germany and italy will be interested in sharing information from this attack as they face similar threats from muslim extremists
france the european union and interpol will share information and given the ability of the terrorists to move freely through europe this passing of information will be critical
the passport free schengen area allows for movement through twenty six countries in europe on the motorways and autobahns so while initially this is an attack on france these terrorists are a threat to all of europe

they had taken shelter from three armed men who had just opened fire against their colleagues during the weekly satirical newspaper's editorial committee
events unfolded very rapidly from then on
french president franois hollande was very quick on the scene the terrorist nature of the events was confirmed almost immediately and so was the shocking number of casualties
twelve dead and eleven injured some critically
the operation appeared to have been prepared in a military style with weapons of war
what can cartoonists with their pen and paper do against killers with automatic weapons 
then the dead were given names this is probably when the news really sank in
the cartoonists with the noms de plume charb cabu wolinski and tignous known to millions in france had been assassinated at point blank range
cabu and wolinski in particular both in their late seventy s have accompanied generations of french people and made them laugh every week in many different publications on radio and on television for over fifty years
i heard people unable to finish their sentences forced to hang up the phone on learning the news too moved to speak
i saw shoppers stopping in their tracks sinking lost onto benches others in tears when learning the news from a friend's call
as u.s. secretary john kerry later commented both in french and english from washington
france gave democracy to the world and knows better than most the price of liberty
the french have been shockingly reminded that libert egalit fraternit values they fought hard to see every day on the frontispiece of their schools and public buildings are threatened by terrorists
while their identities have not yet been confirmed france with the largest muslim community in the western world has always been a prime target for islamist extremists
in one thousand nine hundred and ninety five paris reeled from a wave of terrorist attacks by the algerian gia which killed a total of twelve people
in one thousand nine hundred and eighty six the hezbollah had carried another deadly attack bombing the grand magasin tati and killing eight passers by
french secret services were notoriously good at preventing such plots and president hollande today revealed that many planned attacks had been very recently foiled
there will be a lot of soul searching in the next weeks and months within the french and president hollande is facing difficult questions and an enormous task
with the far right of marine le pen blowing the flames of national divisions and blaming immigration for france's many social and economic problems and the left trying very hard not to stigmatize its muslim citizens there is little space left for a robust and calm public debate
the news that the french writer michel houellebecq is now under police protection as a result of today's attack on charlie hebdo means that the french interior ministry takes no chances with terrorism but it also shows the depth of the malaise at the heart of french society
houellebecq's latest novel takes place in two thousand and twenty two during the presidential elections
after a second round between the far right and a french islamist the islamists are rise to victory with the help of the liberal left and france is refounded as an islamic state
today a french imam called the dead journalists and cartoonists of charlie hebdo martyrs of freedom
but france may have also discovered the price of its complacency and learned that such fraternit should never be taken for granted
charlie hebdo
satirical magazine is no stranger to controversy

once again australian airline qantas grabs the top spot
qantas continues to lead the industry with safety innovations and its fleet is now the youngest seven point nine years it has been since the airline was privatized in one thousand nine hundred and ninety five airlineratings dot com editor geoffrey thomas tells cnn
he says the airline is an industry benchmark for best practice and has taken the lead in virtually every major advancement in airline safety over the past sixty years
rounding out the rest of the top ten in alphabetical order are
air new zealand british airways cathay pacific airways emirates etihad airways eva air finnair lufthansa and singapore airlines
our top ten safest airlines are always at the forefront of safety innovation and launching new planes says thomas
airlineratings dot com's rating system takes into account audits from aviation's governing bodies and lead associations as well as government audits and the airlines fatality records
it also examines airlines operational histories incident records and operational excellence
of the the four hundred and forty nine airlines it monitors one hundred and forty nine have the top seven star safety ranking
this year the site also included a list of the top ten safest low cost airlines for two thousand and fifteen
these are in alphabetical order
aer lingus alaska airlines icelandair jetblue jetstar kulula dot com monarch airlines thomas cook tuifly and westjet
unlike a number of low cost carriers these airlines have all passed the stringent international air transport association operational safety audit audit and have excellent safety records says thomas
low cost does not mean low safety
one fatal accident for every one point three million flights
the release of the airlineratings dot com list comes at a particularly sensitive time for fliers
while two thousand and thirteen was one of the safest years in global aviation history two thousand and fourteen is considered one of the worst in recent years in terms of fatalities due to several high profile air incidents
airlineratings dot com says there were twenty one fatal accidents with nine hundred and eighty six fatalities in two thousand and fourteen higher than the ten year average
however looking to the positive there were only one hundred and eleven crashes in two thousand and fourteen the lowest number in more than eighty years says the geneva based bureau of aircraft accidents archives or baaa
the last time the world had one hundred and eleven crashes was in one thousand nine hundred and twenty seven
if you consider sheer numbers of aircraft crashes flying today is safer says kane ray an analyst with the international bureau of aviation a global aviation consulting group
however there are more aircraft in the sky so naturally the overall number may appear similar to previous decades and in some categories of disaster higher
according to a report on airlineratings dot com the world's airlines carried a record three point three billion passengers on twenty seven million flights in two thousand and fourteen
flashback fifty years and there were a staggering eighty seven crashes killing one thousand five hundred and ninety seven when airlines carried only one hundred and forty one million passengers five percents of today's number says the website
another twist is that fatal accidents for two thousand and fourteen were at a record low twenty one one for every one point three million flights
two of the crashes last year mh three hundred and seventy and mh seventeen were unprecedented in modern times and claimed five hundred and thirty seven lives
in march malaysia airlines flight three hundred and seventy disappeared en route from kuala lumpur to beijing with two hundred and thirty nine aboard
officials believe that plane is somewhere in the indian ocean
but nearly ten months later mh three hundred and seventy hasn't been found
in july malaysia airlines flight seventeen was shot down over eastern ukraine killing all two hundred and ninety eight aboard
malaysia airlines has a five out of seven ranking on airlineratings dot com
airasia indonesia still reeling from the crash of flight qz eight thousand five hundred and one which went down over the java sea on december twenty eight with one hundred and sixty two people on board has a four out of seven star ranking
prior to december airasia had a near flawless safety record with no previous fatal accidents
airlineratings dot com says if an airline has a crash that involves the death of a passenger and or crew members it will automatically receive a deduction of one star giving it a lower safety rating
a crash involving fatalities carries with it a one star deduction for ten years from the date of the incident says the website on a page explaining its ratings system
of the four hundred and forty nine airlines surveyed by airlineratings dot com nearly fifty have just three stars or less
four airlines only achieved one star for safety
two are from nepal tara air and nepal airlines joining kazakhstan's scat airlines and afghanistan's kam air
all four are on a list of airlines banned from flying within the european union
the united states doesn't blacklist individual airlines but it does make public a list of countries it judges to fall short of international aviation safety standards

to scientists it's something more
evidence of the drought that is suspected to have led to the demise of the mayan civilization
the team drilled cores from the blue hole sinkhole and a nearby lagoon
they found that the ratio of titanium to aluminum changed in the ninth and ten th centuries a period when the mayan civilization in the yucatan peninsula went into decline
more titanium means that heavier rains were affecting the region since the runoff from the area's volcanic rock is rich in the element
but from about a.d. eight hundred to one thousand the ratio between the two elements was much smaller indicating that there was much less rainfall
when you have major droughts you start to get famines and unrest droxler said
the mayan civilization noted for its advances in astronomy and agriculture dominated the yucatan in the first half of the first millennium a.d
but by nine hundred most of the civilization's cities located in present day guatemala el salvador honduras and southern mexico had been abandoned
the question of why this happened has tantalized scientists and historians for decades
the drought theory isn't new but the findings of droxler and his colleagues buttress other studies
in two thousand and twelve samples from a two thousand year old stalagmite also showed that drought had afflicted the region in the latter half of the first millennium a.d
the main finding was that a prolonged drought contributed to the collapse of classic mayan civilization environmental archaeologist douglas kennett told livescience two years ago
droxler and his colleagues published their findings in scientific reports

but mystery surrounds how the thirty nine year old pole lost his life
no damage was found to either his body or bike said race director etienne lavigne
hernik who was located just a few hundred meters from the race track had removed his helmet prior to his death
the circumstances surrounding his death have yet to be determined as the competitor did not show any external signs of an accident said a rally statement
hernik who was competing in his first dakar was found at kilometer two hundred and six on the stage between san juan and chilecito in northern argentina
shortly after the rider wearing bib number eighty two failed to appear at the finish line organizers tried to find him
the search was complicated by the absence of a signal from his satellite tracker
when the race management detected the loss of his irritrack signal and was informed that he had not completed the special stage at fifteen sixteen it decided to start a search for the rider at fifteen twenty three said a statement
an ambulance helicopter found the rider three hundred meters off the route at sixteen three
unfortunately the on board doctor could only confirm the rider's death
hernik's death means five competitors have died since the rally moved from west africa to south america in two thousand and nine because of security concerns in the sahara region
all those five have been competing in the motorbike section
since the dakar began on december twenty six one thousand nine hundred and seventy eight a total of twenty four competitors have died but there have been over fifty fatalities when including the deaths of spectators and officials
speaking after the stage the overall leader of the motorbike race joan barreda bort said it had been a challenging section
it was really dangerous because we were on river beds with a lot of stones and broken up tracks all day the spaniard told reporters
race organizers said hernik had previously competed and completed both the two thousand and thirteen morocco rally and the two thousand and fourteen abu dhabi desert challenge
the whole dakar family offers its condolences to michal's family close friends and team added the dakar statement

the concept has been around since the one thousand nine hundred and forty s when science fiction writer isaac asimov posited the idea of a robot manned space station that delivered energy to earth via microwaves
today the idea is less science fiction than a steadily advancing reality
the united states china india and japan all have projects at various stages of development that would see robots assemble solar arrays that could provide the earth with massive amounts of clean and renewable energy delivered wirelessly
some variants of the idea could even see as much as one gw of energy beamed to receivers on earth enough to power a large city
according to dr paul jaffe spacecraft engineer at the us naval research laboratory the concept is scientifically sound
nasa and the us department of energy did a study in the late seventy s that cost twenty million dollar at the time and looked at it in pretty great depth dr jaffe told cnn
the conclusion at that time was that there was nothing wrong with the physics but the real question is the economics
the cost lies in the number of space launches required to build the power transmitting satellite
with costs as high as forty thousand dollar per kilogram for some space launches the final price tag for the first space based solar power station could be as high as twenty billion dollar
while the recent entry of private space companies stands significantly to cut costs basic physics dictates that getting payloads into space is still an expensive undertaking
the subject is revisited every ten years when the technology changes and some of the factors affecting the economics change
he said the wars in the middle east gave new impetus to the space based solar power as scientific researchers with the military wrestled with the problems of delivering energy to troops in hostile areas
multiple and potentially hidden receivers could tap space based solar power and relieve the military of the expensive and often dangerous task of supplying troops with generator diesel by either road or air he said
if you could deliver electricity from space that would be kind of attractive he said
two proven ways of getting the power to earth exist in the form of either laser beams or microwaves
the laser beam option would involve sending small laser transmitting satellites into space at the relatively low cost of between five hundred million dollar and one billion dollar
the self assembling satellite would lower costs and the small diameter of the laser beam would make it easier to collect on the ground
but at just one mw to ten mw per satellite many satellites would be needed to provide enough energy
as well as this laser transmitting satellites would have difficulty beaming power through clouds and rain
the microwave option would have the advantage of uninterrupted transmission through rain hail or any other atmospheric conditions and could provide gigawatts of power
microwave technology dr jaffe explained has been established for decades
as early as one thousand nine hundred and sixty four scientists were able to power a helicopter using microwaves
dr jaffe said with a large receiving area the energy from the microwaves was so dissipated that it would present no danger to life
the chief disadvantage however is the fact that as many as one hundred launches into space would be required to construct the space stations with costs running into tens of billions
unfortunately too from a public relations standpoint both microwaves and lasers have negative connotations for most people because they associate microwaves with the oven in their kitchen and lasers with science fiction space battles dr jaffe said
his research is currently concentrated on the so called sandwich module the part of the solar array that actually converts the sunlight into power
one side of the sandwich receives solar energy with a photovoltaic panel electronics in the middle convert the current into a radio frequency and the other side has an antenna to beam it away
people might not associate radio waves with carrying energy says jaffe because they think of them for communications like radio tv or cell phones
they don't think about them as carrying usable amounts of power
despite the technology already being available for space based solar power dr jaffe believes the first space power station is still decades away even though the japanese have already made it one of the pillars of their space program
without the similar research base that we have in the united states for say fusion energy it's unlikely to make meaningful progress he said
if the japanese make progress in the next five years people might start to notice and say why aren't we doing that here 
ultimately he said space based solar energy is like most novel ideas
it's hard to tell if it's nuts until you've actually tried

nasa is currently doing just that
floating a concept that could one day see a thirty day manned mission to earth's closest planetary neighbor
eventually the mission could involve a permanent human presence suspended above the planet
also known as the morning star and named after the goddess of love and beauty because it shone the brightest of the five planets known to ancient astronomers venus is a hot sulphurous hellish place whose surface has more volcanoes than any other planet in the solar system
with a mean temperature of four hundred and sixty two degrees celsius an atmospheric pressure ninety two times greater than earth's and a cloud layer of sulphuric acid even probes to venus have lasted little more than two hours
its surface is hot enough to melt lead and its atmospheric pressure is the equivalent of diving a mile underwater
but above this cauldron of carbon dioxide at an altitude of fifty km scientists say the conditions are as close to earth's as you'll find anywhere in the solar system
the gravity at this altitude is only slightly lower than that of earth its atmospheric pressure is similar and the aerospace provides enough protection from solar radiation to make it no more dangerous than taking a trip to canada
known at nasa as havoc high altitude venus operational concept engineers and scientists at the systems analysis and concepts directorate at nasa's langley research center in hampton virginia have been working on a preliminary feasibility study on how robots and humans could make a venus mission a reality
the atmosphere of venus is an exciting destination for both further scientific study and future human exploration said aerospace engineer christopher a. jones of the space mission analysis branch
one concept is a lighter than air vehicle that could carry either a host of instruments and probes or a habitat and ascent vehicle for a crew of two astronauts to explore venus for up to a month
he said the study showed the mission would require less time to complete than crewed missions to other planets and could even be a practice run for a mars mission
venus has the advantage of being much closer to earth
its minimum distance to earth is thirty eight million kilometers compared with fifty four point six million to mars
the kind of multi decade mission that we believe could succeed would be an evolutionary program for the exploration of venus with focus on the mission architecture and vehicle concept for a thirty day crewed mission into venus's atmosphere he said
at the heart of the concept is the logistically difficult task of sending a spacecraft into the atmosphere of venus without landing it
the havoc model involves placing the astronauts inside an aeroshell that would enter the atmosphere at four thousand five hundred miles per hour
decelerating during its descent to just four hundred and fifty meters per second and then deploying a parachute the shell would fall away to reveal a folded airship
robotic arms would unfurl the blimp which would be inflated with helium to allow the airship to float thirty miles above the planet's fiery surface
jones said the key technical challenges for the mission include performing the aerocapture maneuvers at venus and earth inserting and inflating the airships and protecting the solar panels and structure from the sulphuric acid in the atmosphere
with advances in technology and further refinement of the concept missions to the venusian atmosphere can expand humanity's future in space he said
suspended in a gondola beneath the airships astronauts would not have to contend with the physical challenges of zero gravity where weightlessness causes muscles to wither and bones to demineralize
and at a mere one hundred and sixty seven degrees fahrenheit just thirty degrees fahrenheit hotter than the highest temperature ever recorded on earth even current technology has the ability to contend with everything that venus could throw at the mission
even so havoc is envisioned as a multi phase campaign and robotic missions would have to be sent to test technologies and better understand the atmosphere
while nasa has no current plans to fund the concept the langley based team continues its work with the hope the space agency could make the plan come to fruition within several decades
eventually a short duration human mission would allow us to gain experience having humans live at another world with the hope that it would someday be possible to live in the atmosphere permanently jones said

for dr. heinrich h. blthoff one of the leading researchers on the mycopter project it's a serious question
making an idiot proof flying car that anyone can pilot has involved years of painstaking research and may be the secret to the long held dream of firing up the rotors levitating and simply flying out of the bumper to bumper grind
now the european union wants to make the dream a reality researching the feasibility of small commuter air vehicles to ease the world's traffic congestion
it's been a dream of mine since i read it in science fiction books and in the movies as a kid but science fiction is becoming the reality these days says dr. blthoff director of perception cognition and action at the max planck institute in tbingen germany
under the four year project the eu has drawn together six institutes from across europe to look at the problems associated with commuting in personal aviation vehicles
at the center of the research is a focus not so much on building the vehicle but on all the issues and challenges surrounding commuter aviation
in the case of his institute it's how to make the machine accessible to ordinary drivers
there's no intention with this project to actually build the system explains dr.blthoff whose research is part of a two thousand and seven eu report called out of the box
ideas about the future of air transport
they said to us please not another proposal for a flying vehicle we have received so many there are so many other issues to address he said
these challenges involve setting up virtual corridor traffic systems in the sky that guide pavs under existing aircraft using advances in swarm technology to stop them crashing into each other and working on landing systems that do not involve air traffic controllers
if you want to make a flying car it should be for everybody but you can't make every car driver into a pilot he said
the idea is to fly in uncontrolled airspace without interfering with all the other aircraft
he said the plan is to make the flying vehicles so intelligent they communicate with each other and avoid collisions without any human input
his institute in particular is focused on the problems of the human machine interface
creating a design that reduces the withering array of dials and monitors in a helicopter or plane into a few simple controls on a dashboard
keeping the simple steering wheel on a flying vehicle where controls must make adjustments for traveling through three rather than two dimensions has been just one of the challenges of the project
for more than one hundred years cars have used the steering wheel
it was a good idea for cars but if you make the transition to the air why should a driver learn something completely new 
he said
the aircraft would be largely autonomous and would for the most part need no piloting at all
flying through highways in the sky flight paths designed to host swarms of pavs flying in formation the pavs would avoid obstacles and select landing spots autonomously by using intelligent sight sensors
the controls would be shared between the pilot and the machine allowing for what researchers call comprehensive situational awareness
so called haptic controls that put a feeling of resistance in the steering wheel would allow drivers to know when they were edging towards the confines of the highway in the sky
other aspects of the study have looked at the social impact of pavs as the commuter vehicle of the future
many people might ask whether we really want thousands of these things buzzing around in the sky dr blthoff said
researchers have been looking at ways of constructing pav flight paths above existing freeways and roads to minimize the environmental impact keeping the flight ceiling at fifty meters to avoid commercial aircraft
while flying time is relatively short due to the constraints of battery life using current technology researchers on the project had found that ninety percent of commuter trips were shorter than twenty five km and averaged about thirty minutes with peak hour delays of about fifteen minutes making a pav perfect for short hop journeys from work to home
dr blthoff said recent advances and social acceptance of google's driverless car had given real hope to researchers on the project
that really makes me very optimistic he said
the car industry has been producing the same basic model of automobile for more than one hundred years
google is doing something that is making the car industry wake up
i would never have expected that several states in the united states have legalized autonomous driving for example
even so there are many issues still to be examined
legally for instance if there's no driver we don't know who's responsible in case of a crash
these questions still need to be answered
while the driverless car is now a reality he says it might be some time yet before anyone can walk into a dealership and buy a personal aviation vehicle
the timescale is to have them available by two thousand and fifty says dr blthoff
but i am not likely to be around in two thousand and fifty so i'm quietly optimistic that we will have one before that
can this one wheeled wonder change the way you commute to work 
will people still be useful in the twenty one st century

at least thirty eight people were killed and dozens others were injured in a car bomb explosion in front of the police college in the yemeni capital sanaa wednesday morning two top interior ministry officials told cnn
the bomber parked his vehicle in the middle of the road and then boarded another that was waiting for him said abdulbari al shamiri a witness to the explosion
as soon as he left the scene everyone one hundred meters from the explosion was killed or injured al shamiri said
police recruits were waiting in line at the gates of the police college when the attack took place the interior ministry said
no group immediately claimed responsibility for the attack


where's the batterer i've come to meet 
the man who grabbed pushed and punched a woman he claimed to love 
the one i've enlisted to help me understand
why do some men do this 
how can they be stopped 
dylan is ivy league educated a self professed nerd who was raised by loving parents with advanced degrees
he grew up in a beautiful home in a tony atlanta suburb
he enjoyed every privilege a boy could want
he vacationed in places like cairo london and paris before he could even shave
he defies the stereotypical image of a batterer i have in mind
i'm ashamed of my own naivet
lesson one
just because he had it so good doesn't mean he wasn't capable of becoming brutal
dylan has met me after work in a quiet office outside atlanta
he's asked that i change his name and hide his identity to protect him and his victim
in exchange he has agreed to take me back to a time he'd rather forget
he will map out how he became an abuser
and how some ten years later he became a new person the man he wanted to be
going inside the mind of a batterer i'll learn means examining much more than the images we hold onto
the story of suspended nfl running back ray rice and other abusers doesn't end with a knock out punch in an elevator or an attack never seen on video
nor do these tragedies begin there
dylan's parents weren't perfect
neither were friends who he idolized
not many people are
scene one
his mother and father argued
the abuse was verbal sometimes physical
twice he watched his father push his mother
scene two
he was sitting on a bus in the high school parking lot
he watched out the window as an upperclassman he respected struck his girlfriend
hard
she was the sort of girl dylan dreamed of dating someday
he gawked with others as she cowered and bled
at home and at school no one talked about what dylan saw
love between a man and a woman as far as he could tell was allowed to look this way
now in his mid thirty s dylan has a tool for identifying what he witnessed and how he acted himself
have you ever seen the power and control wheel 
he asks me
i have no idea what this means
he pulls out a sheet with a round diagram
it shows tactics a man might use to gain leverage in a relationship ways he may behave before resorting to physical or sexual violence
these are the less obvious but insidious means by which men keep women down
red flags dylan couldn't identify back then
minimizing
coercion
male privilege
at first the language sounds like over intellectualized psychobabble
but soon i realize that the wheel represents everything i'd like to caution my nieces about before they go out into the world
dylan was in college when he met his first girlfriend
early on without even knowing her friends he told her he didn't like them
isolation
controlling who she sees
when she came to his room later at night than he wanted he locked the door something he never did otherwise and made her knock
he took his time answering to remind her who was boss
male privilege
acting like the master of the castle
fast forward to after college
he was living with a new girlfriend isabelle in atlanta
she might have had the better job but he was the one who could drive
she has a disability and depended on him to get to work
he didn't let her forget it
threats
making her feel guilty
the cloud of economic abuse
she could lose her job
his boss treated him like an idiot but dylan felt he had to take it
out in the world it seemed like people walked all over him
so at home dylan exerted power in the only place he felt he could
he was making more money by then he says and had earned the right to act like a man
more male privilege
defining their roles
he criticized how she did her hair what she wore even the way she filled the dishwasher
emotional abuse
making her feel small and humiliated
you see how this works right 
he kept the wheel well oiled and it would eventually spin out of control
it's one thing to hear his story but what about hers 
once i learned he was still in touch with isabelle i told dylan i wanted to give voice to her perspective too
it seemed only fair i said
he didn't think she'd be interested in talking but he agreed to reach out to her for me
a week later isabelle and i first communicated
she was eager to speak but only if i used a pseudonym
she doesn't want her past to define her present or future
growing up thousands of miles from dylan isabelle watched her father suppress her mother
he degraded her with his words and threw things to intimidate her
even though her mother would later find the strength to leave isabelle learned early about submission
today she seems self aware and certainly no pushover as we share chips and salsa in a small mexican joint
thinking back to how her relationship with dylan unfolded she says she should have seen what was coming
she'd taken to going away on weekends to escape him
she pleaded with him to move out of her house but he wouldn't budge
he used her inability to drive against her even though she'd managed just fine before he came along
he isolated her from friends and family
too ashamed to admit how unhappy and worried she was she isolated herself further
he put her down in public and made her feel like a child
she was embarrassed
after all she had a master's degree
she was smarter than this
still for so long she hungered for what they had when the relationship was good
i wanted him to come back to me as i remembered him she says
i lived for those moments when he would show up
when she changed the radio station in the car without asking he says he gave her a push and yelled about wanting to be respected
she remembers him pinning her against the door in the moving car and worried that if it opened she'd be a goner
when she once called him an asshole he grabbed her arm
if you want to call me an asshole i'll show you an asshole he says
it was a sunday morning when he crossed the line for the last time
this is how dylan recalls it
she'd been up late talking on the phone with a male friend and dylan decided she was cheating
he ripped up some of her favorite photographs
he called her a bitch and a whore
he took a vase of flowers they were irises he says thinking back a decade and dumped it over her head
he threatened to break her cell phone
and then he unleashed his remaining rage with a punch to her chest
in that moment he says i realized what i'd done
he picked up the flowers and poured on the apologies
he left to give her space
he was at his parents house when the sheriff's deputy drove up and served him a temporary restraining order
dylan never fought it
that last punch was a jolt to him too
he'd assaulted his girlfriend of more than four years on of all days father's day
i will not bring a child into this he remembers thinking
i was very clear that i needed to find a new way to move in the world because the way i was moving wasn't working and wasn't healthy
when he stood before the court he quickly agreed to stay away from her for a year
he didn't want her to have to sit on a stand and recount all he'd done
he says he wanted to protect her feelings
but to be honest dylan didn't want to hear it
the story she tells is less sanitized and more haunting
isabelle says on the day of the incident she thought she'd die
she hadn't been on the phone late at night as he remembers it
no she'd escaped to a hotel to crash with visiting friends and had stayed up late with them
back home that sunday morning isabelle was jolted awake from a nap when he grabbed her
he called me a whore she says and began ragdolling me around the house
that vase of flowers he spilled over her 
he intended to break it over her head she believes but she was able to push his arm away
he tried to snap her cell phone in two and asked her which half she'd want
she tried to close a door between them which only enraged him further
never shut the door on me
then came that punch to her chest which sent her five foot four one hundred and ten pound frame flying into a heap of laundry on the floor
the world she says fell silent
and then the universe said just play dead and so i did
he was sufficiently freaked out and backed off long enough for her to crawl into the bathroom and lock herself inside
he peppered her with apologies through the door
he offered her advil
she laughs at the absurdity of that suggestion
as if advil could make things better 
you need to leave she says she told him
and i suggest you take an overnight bag
she's grateful there was no weapon in the house
a friend came over to help her
she called a locksmith to change the locks before she left the house
she wore a turtleneck to hide the growing bruises
she pretended she was ok
but in the restaurant where the two friends went isabelle could barely breathe
her friend took her to the hospital where the doctor said i don't know how you're alive 
one inch to the left she was told and the direct blow to her chest could have killed her
i'm very lucky she says
i have angels on my shoulders
dylan promised the court he'd stay away
no contact
no phone calls
no showing up at her door
he paid restitution covering some expenses such as the cost of changing the locks in her house
he then set out to change himself
he camped out in the self help section of barnes and noble
he armed himself with books including anger management for dummies
when books could only take him so far he sought out more and came across men stopping violence a national training institute committed to creating safer communities for women and girls
the thirty two year old organization conducts trainings in churches corporations community groups government agencies and schools
the primary aim is prevention to help society understand and change the social norms that create violent men and thereby prevent the abuse of women from even starting
only a small fraction of batterers get busted explains msv executive director ulester douglas
it's better to engage all men before they abuse whether they are black white rich poor young or old
if we rely only on intervention we miss the mark douglas says
prevention is what we need and this must be a systemic approach
but there is an intervention arm of msv and dylan signed up for its twenty four week educational course to learn alternatives to controlling and abusive behavior
the atlanta area course which teaches about two hundred and twenty men a year draws those who've been sent under court order and men like dylan who self enroll oftentimes because they feel they have too much to lose
maybe a wife has threatened to leave unless they get help
or protective services has required their attendance before they can see their children again
dylan learned to let go of his definition of manhood the image society drills into boys
it says tears are for sissies vulnerability is a sign of weakness
it teaches that the only manly emotions are anger and rage
he owned what he'd done and who he'd become
only then could he change
he found out how to be intentional and thoughtful
he became versed in what men stopping violence calls the arc of choice a path lined with speed bumps to stop knee jerk attacks verbal or otherwise
he learned to take deep breaths and think about his choices
he learned to honor his true emotions and not hide behind others
he learned to listen to his body and catch himself before acting
he learned to as he put it center myself in a spirit of patience respect peace love and empathy for what the other person is feeling
it has to be hopeful 
today dylan sees himself as a better man
he went on to work in the field of social justice dedicating his time to the protection of women
and he volunteers with men stopping violence
he says he's had healthy relationships and is in one now
he calls isabelle his best friend
that gives her pause
she cares for him deeply sees him as a sort of brother and believes that he's grown and changed
she doesn't believe for a second that he would hurt another woman
but best friend 
sometimes she feels that way
other times she struggles to go that far
i forgave that day because i choose to forgive she says
but some of my life got stolen
she's proud of his success the career he's built but knows in some ways she paid for it
he wouldn't be doing what he's doing after all if he hadn't abused her and found his way to men stopping violence
for her the ripple effects still linger
call it ptsd
if a man takes her arm unexpectedly she flinches
a critical comment no matter how small can set her back to a different time
a scream even at a television during a football game might leave her rattled
while he can cut out the ugly details of the past she doesn't feel she can
this old relationship still shapes how she relates to men no matter all the therapy she's had
her radar is on for bad things to come and sometimes she worries that she'll miss the signs
when a man says something nice to her she may wonder if she's being manipulated
she doesn't love as freely
but she also emerged on the other side empowered in new ways
she isn't afraid to stand up for herself
she's strong enough to know she'd rather be alone than mistreated
isabelle is only willing to share her part of the journey because she wants women to see their value
she wants to give hope to those in unhealthy or dangerous relationships
i want our story to encourage women to get out and men to get help she says
it has to be hopeful
otherwise i'd rather keep this chapter in the past
she knows there are those who can't understand the friendship she's built with dylan
cutting ties though isn't easy when there's history
isabelle will be the first to admit that letting dylan into her life was a gamble
but she chooses to see the good in him
and she knows he's unusual
he's taken responsibility
he's accountable
he is so in tune with the patterns of men that she benefits from his advice
it's like getting counseling without paying for it she says
and she's not afraid to dole out her own feedback to keep him in line
i found my voice she says and he learned to listen
the story of dylan and isabelle moves me
it also terrifies me
they are beyond unique
that's clear
i mean how many men who've battered really go on to build a career dedicated to protecting women 
how many women who've been abused can safely befriend their abuser 
i lose sleep wondering if it's too good to be true
it's a friday afternoon when i stroll in to the dekalb county courthouse for a reality check
around me are men who've recently been arrested for misdemeanor charges related to domestic violence
they are only here because the court made them show up at this afternoon class as a condition for bond
no one is happy to be here
some are outwardly mad
what about when you've got a woman beating on you 
what if a girl likes it and puts up with it 
i don't like the idea of getting locked up for something i didn't do
what if she wanted to get me in trouble and knew if she called the cops the system would be on her side 
these questions are tossed at the facilitators of tactics and choices offered by men stopping violence
they have a little more than three hours to engage men shift thinking and hopefully protect women
if they're lucky some of these men will later land in their twenty four week course the type that helped dylan
i know we don't live with angels
i know we don't live with saints a teacher says
but the only person in the world i can control is myself
the conversation is steered toward the importance of building partnerships based on respect and equality
men are reminded that if a relationship isn't healthy for them they should get out
this talk about equality though doesn't fly with everyone
if i make more money then i have the last word
we are designed to fill certain roles in relationships
it's biblical
why is man's role being so feminized 
in a minute we're all going to be wearing dresses
i want to learn how to be successful in a relationship without being sensitive
i want you to hear this
the world is changing warns an instructor
begin to change your thinking renew your mind grow into a new possibility
during the last hour of the course as instructors guide the men through exercises i see a few light bulbs go off but i wonder once they leave the room and return to their environments will the glimmer of understanding fade 
can they like dylan give change a chance 
or will they walk the path they've already traveled and abuse again 
and most pressing to me how many isabelles will suffer in their wakes

pirila has used the technique for almost twenty years taking photos of people in finland norway italy and france
they all have a documentary basis i.e
they show how where people live how their interiors look and what they see from their windows pirila said
but besides this
because of the two worlds merging down to each other a third reality is created and made visible
that reflects perhaps mostly my mental landscape but i feel at least a bit also the landscape of the model's mind
before working with the technique pirila had worked with pinhole cameras which are essentially camera obscura on a smaller scale
light and color slide through a small hole to create an inverted image that is absorbed by light sensitive paper
both techniques are slow and unpredictable and compel one to slow down and stop amid the daily routine pirila said
moreover the actual process is crucial in both
they present a challenge to experiment and extend conventional photography
pirila decided to explore camera obscura after seeing black and white images by abelardo morell in a magazine
she couldn't find much information on this technique and she had many trials before success
pirila now has about seventy images in her project
pirila chose models she knew students friends neighbors or random acquaintances though always they are people who touch me in one way or other she said
pirila sets up a room alone then invites the model into the space
together they find a place for the subject to pose that is comfortable for the model and aesthetically satisfying for pirila
it is a big pleasure for me to show and share this light phenomena with my model she said
pirila used color film when she first started the project and has since switched to digital
film exposures vary from minutes to hours and digital exposures last anywhere from seconds to minutes she said
regardless models must hold a pose for a relatively long time for a picture to be taken in this space with low light
darkness and long exposures create the contemplative atmosphere and let us enjoy and be inside the magic world which appears in an ordinary room for a while pirila said
light is the most important factor in photography pirila said and camera obscura attracted her because of its play with light
i feel that the light is my home she said
that is why i am a photographer


in one thousand nine hundred and eighty four my mother was diagnosed with stage four cancer of the ovaries uterus ureters small intestine bladder and kidney
i was eight
she was given six months to live
she refused to accept that and sought treatment in tampa florida
her condition improved until two years later when she was diagnosed with a brain tumor
her body was mangled from all the surgeries
she had to wear an ostomy bag which i learned how to change because she was so weak
she had to give up her nursing career
she had to give up the fun things in life she enjoyed doing because her body couldn't take it
she no longer had the quality of life that she deserved
my father no longer physically attracted to her satisfied his physical needs with other women
she was too sick to give him what he physically wanted
in one thousand nine hundred and eighty eight when she was well enough to be at home full time my parents separated and filed for divorce
cancer broke their foundation of love and trust
the pain didn't stop there
in one thousand nine hundred and ninety two she was diagnosed with stage four breast cancer and lost her breasts
the only part she felt that still identified her as a woman was taken away
the same year my father was diagnosed with brain cancer
he died quickly three weeks after his diagnosis
he simply collapsed and died
my right to death with dignity at twenty nine
for years she suffered
it's hard watching your mother cry over the pain
it's hard watching your mother break down piece by piece
for years she fought a pain pill addiction
she wanted to live so she could raise her children but in reality she spent her time in the hospitals operating rooms and doctor's offices
her hopes took a horrible turn
she suffered greatly for seventeen years until two thousand and one when doctors found cancer on her spine
she killed herself three days later
the person who died was not my mother
she was not the funny intelligent strong and fierce woman i knew
the person who died was sad and had lost all hope
my last memory of my mother is of this person
lying on the bed with a bottle of pills next to her and her eyes half open
there is no justice in her lasting legacy
she deserved better
she deserved to go in a more dignified way
dying with dignity is more than just for the person who is dying
it's for their loved ones
if it meant my mother leaving this world the way she was in one thousand nine hundred and eighty four and not in two thousand and one then i would have supported her decision to do so
my last memories of her should have been when she was still full of life on the outside even though she was dying on the inside
she chose to take her life anyway except it was without her loved ones surrounding her saying their final words and making peace
she died alone
my sister found her
her death was treated like a crime scene because she killed herself at home
there were no final words
no goodbyes
nothing but the unimaginable guilt i carry with me every day because maybe i could have done something better for her
it's not fair to throw stones at someone because they are through fighting
no one person or disease is the same so it's unfair to judge and compare
just because a person decides they are done does not make them weak or selfish
dying with dignity is a brave decision to make
it's a decision that involves everyone and it's one of the greatest gifts of love that person can give to those left behind
when assisted suicide is not the answer
some say she beat cancer
she was given six months to live but lived for seventeen years
but what kind of life was it 
was it a life worth living 
she had so much to live for but at what cost 
what kind of life was it for her children 
i can tell you it was hard
i was robbed of a childhood
it was years of struggles and tears
i would never wish what i had lived through on anyone
no child should have to see their parents suffer so much
today i'm happily married and have a four year old son
i would never want him to watch either one of his parents suffer
if a diagnosis is final and the options are there i just may choose to die with dignity and end my life on my terms
if you have to explain death how hard is it to include dying before the suffering becomes too great 
sure the experiences built me up to be strong and be able to handle some serious stress and in part made me the person i am today but i would gladly trade it back if my mother could have done things her way when she really should have

being a mother having a six year old daughter how do i explain it to her 
no this is not us 
said the muslim from virginia
the immigration worker's powerful video message hit on the emotions some muslims around the world were feeling
outrage disgust and shame
i am just livid said the thirty one year old
i don't know why we feel that it's ok to kill innocent people in the name of protecting something that does not need or require protection
i am really sorry to the whole world as a muslim that we have some ignorant people that have taken some very ignorant actions in the name of faith
to be clear mazhar and other muslims who spoke to cnn were not apologizing for their beliefs some are apologizing to the world on behalf of their religion sullied by the few muslims extremists who attacked french satirical magazine charlie hebdo this week
of the twelve people who died four were cartoonists and one was a muslim police officer on the scene
theresa corbin a self described feminist converted to islam two months after september eleven
the new orleans resident wears a hijab and says she has felt more stares than normal after the paris terror attack
i fear the attack will mean that people will be more likely to sneer at me to call me names in public or even attack me she said
but i hope that it means that people will ask me questions about my faith and that i can make it clear that these attacks have no place in islam
perception is also playing into ahmad basel burghul's mind
the twenty year old student from istanbul turkey is no longer thinking of studying abroad in france
the attack made him suspect that some french might look upon muslims differently after wednesday's attack
meanwhile stephanie dunbar siam an american living in muscat oman was initially angry at the hijackers of her religion
but she became angrier when she realized she would have to reassure the people around her that this is not islam
i want to reaffirm my intense alarm and disheartening at the deaths of the charlie hebdo staff members
but i will not apologize for my beliefs or my religion she said
siam sees this time as an opportunity to educate people
it means i will persevere even harder to learn more about my faith so i can counter misunderstanding and discrimination in a positive manner the way prophet mohammed did it











but cast aside cynicism and you'll find a number of incredible things china does best
we've got ten of them right here
as the first place to domesticate pigs we can be sure china knows a thing or two about making pork delicious
according to the u.s. national pork board the earliest evidence of domestication of the wild boar can be dated to four thousand nine hundred bc in china
historically the animal has been so integral to chinese society that the chinese character for home is a pictogram of a pig with a roof over its head
today china is the world's top producer and consumer of hogs and wow how it's consumed
there are arguably two pinnacles of pork cooking in china
dongbo rou a glistening block of braised pork belly prized for the melt in mouth fat and char siu a sweet salty cut of meat barbecued til tender and smoky
both dishes are tricky and time consuming to create but so worth it
we love and respect the traditions of the entire world of barbecue out there but china's unparalleled experience and variety of dishes places it atop the pork pile
so china isn't all that great at football so what 
its state system of athletic training has perfected a foolproof method for producing top gymnasts ping pong champs badminton aces and diving divas
since it first participated in the modern olympics in one thousand nine hundred and eighty four it's steadily risen toward the top of the medals table
chinese style athleticism reached a climax at the two thousand and eight summer olympics in beijing when the country garnered fifty one gold medals and ranked number one overall
although a top contender in diving and gymnastics chinese competitors are practically unbeatable at badminton and table tennis winning more gold medals in these events than any other country at the olympics
in comparison the united states is undeniably the long standing king of the olympics but it's had an eighteen olympic head start on china
china's achievements today including several of the items on this list can be credited to a deep sense of pragmatism which assesses most situations by looking at the practical consequences of actions
on a policy level china will engage with any country regardless of moral standing
as deng xiaoping architect of modern china famously said
it doesn't matter whether a cat is white or black as long as it catches mice
deng pretty much captured the political and entrepreneurial zeitgeist for the past few decades
the philosophy explains most of china's customs and cultural norms including the gifting of hongbao the importance of maintaining guanxi and filial piety
calligraphy in china is an art form a meditative practice a scholarly pursuit and nowadays an investment
with a rich tradition of calligraphy tracing back thousands of years china reveres the works on paper by great masters as well as the experimental new media calligraphic works of contemporary artists
at auction these calligraphic artworks routinely fetch millions of dollars collected by connoisseurs around the world such as the paper scroll gong fu tie which sold for eight point two million dollar at sotheby's new york in september two thousand and thirteen
the ancient work was written by the famous poet su shi and consists of just nine characters
china is great at copying other people's version of the wheel and making it more affordable
there's a cheap chinese version of almost everything and anything from luxury fashions to electronic gadgets
while the iphone six plus is selling at almost two thousand four hundred dollar in china counterfeit iphone models sell for between two dollar and seventy five dollar on china's online shop taobao
try these ambitious copies of entire towns such as the historic austrian town recreated in guangdong and the one of manhattan proposed in tianjin
a fast growing middle class and an explosion in domestic travel means china needs hotels
it's meeting the demand with the fastest quirkiest and most impressive construction boom the world has ever seen
budget chain hanting inns boasts two hotel openings per day across china
the company expects to be the world's largest chain by two thousand and twenty
meanwhile a thirty story hotel was created in fifteen days in hunan province at a cost of seventeen million dollar
the construction company is now aiming to pull off the same feat in eight days
it's not just the cheap and cheerful the country excels in
check out these outrageously glamorous hotels that can be visited in china right away
the first in the world to appreciate the simple drink made from steeping leaves in water china has since developed a profound appreciation for tea
evaluated much in the way that wine is in the west different teas have distinct characteristics depending on terroir treatment and storage
was it picked before or after the rainy season 
were the leaves air dried wok dried fermented or aged 
has the tea been steeped and served in earthenware and if so where did the clay for the teapot originate 
the culture of tea has become so integral to china and held in such esteem that prestigious varietals regularly sell for thousands of dollars per kilo it's practically currency
while the world's highest point mount everest exists on the border between nepal and china and is claimed by both countries this in itself isn't an achievement just a geographical fact
the triumph is in bringing the masses quickly and efficiently to the world's peaks
the tanggula pass at more than five thousand meters in the tanggula mountains can be traversed via the qinghai tibet railway
meanwhile the new daocheng yading airport in sichuan province lies at four thousand four hundred and eleven meters and is the highest civilian airport
it will be usurped by the proposed nagqu dagring airport in tibet planned at four thousand four hundred and thirty six meters when it gets built in two thousand and fifteen
the humble dumpling has been elevated to art form in china
nowhere can you find a diversity and sophistication that matches china's exhaustive list of dumpling variations
sure many cuisines boast a savory or sweet dumpling maybe even a fried dumpling but china's got dumplings with transparent wrappers dumplings in a mouth numbing sauce dumplings that burst with soup at first bite dumplings made with fish meat dough
let's just stop there or we'll be here all day
the dumpling is also a marker of auspicious things in china
families gather during new year celebrations to wrap and eat dumplings together in the hope of prosperous times ahead
the world is still shaking in its boots from the raucous display of totalitarian jazz hands that opened the two thousand and eight summer olympic games in beijing
whether you saw it as a spectacle of precision showmanship or the result of a lockstep society trying to freak out the entire planet there's no denying it was the opening ceremony that made all others tremble in shock and awe
the hour long cinematic showcase directed by celebrated filmmaker zhang yimou incorporated every chinese art form from ink painting to acrobatics to tai chi and opera
it succeeded in stirring patriotism at home and inspiring new fans abroad during an olympics fraught with political tension and human rights issues

waves are expected to be one point five to two meters high said bambang sulistyo head of indonesia's search and rescue agency at a press conference in jakarta
sulistyo said that if the weather is relatively good divers will be sent to the location where four objects were detected on sonar
there are eighty nine divers on standby and divers from russia will join the effort he said
search teams have found four large pieces of debris believed to be parts of the aircraft
sulistyo said the latest objects including one that is eighteen meters long were located by sonar in the priority search area
searchers came upon the metal parts after spotting an oil slick late friday
bad weather conditions including fifteen foot waves and strong underwater currents prevented divers from conducting searches saturday meaning no additional bodies were recovered
sunday's forecast called for more favorable conditions he said
who was on the plane
anton castilani is eager to get the rest of the victims out of the waters before they sink to the bottom of the sea
he is in charge of identifying them and said that gases in the bodies that keep them afloat disperse after a few days in the water
it's been nearly a week already
the plane went missing on sunday
he urged families to be patient with his team as they identify loved ones
he wants to do his work right
we have to make sure that we have to return that right body to the right family he said
decomposition also slows his work down
the later the dead bodies come to you the harder you work he said
his team uses fingerprints and dental records as well as dna to find out who they have recovered
on friday the uss sampson which the u.s. navy has deployed to help recovered some bodies
altogether the number retrieved rose to thirty
a limited number of them will be autopsied to determine the cause of death to aid the investigation an indonesian official said saturday
but many families don't want autopsies done
for the sake of the investigation we agree and it is accepted by interpol to perform autopsies on the pilot co pilot and some randomly selected passengers said east java police chief anas yusuf
six of the plane's victims have been identified
the first hayati lutfiah hamid was laid to rest thursday
airasia ceo tony fernandes said he was traveling to surabaya indonesia to bring home the body of flight attendant khairunisa haidar fauzi
i can not describe how i feel
there are no words he said on twitter
finding the fuselage and black box of the airbus a three hundred and twenty two hundred has priority for the fifty nine diving teams searching underneath the waves
russia has joined the effort with twenty two underwater teams along with a search plane and a cargo jet
the searchers are concentrating on a one thousand five hundred and seventy five square nautical mile zone that officials believe is the most probable area to find the remains of the aircraft
what we know
qz eight thousand five hundred and one took off early december twenty eight from surabaya bound for singapore
roughly thirty five minutes into the flight the pilot asked air traffic control for permission to turn left and climb to avoid bad weather
minutes later the plane disappeared from air traffic control's radar
what we don't know
what happened on board after contact with the plane was lost
no distress call was received
some experts speculate that the aircraft experienced an aerodynamic stall because of a lack of speed or from flying at too sharp an angle to get enough lift
other theories include a lack of information about the plane's position or storm damage to the engines
what we know
the black boxes are key
actually they're orange and should be in the plane's tail
a lab in jakarta will analyze them if they are recovered
the batteries powering the pingers that send acoustic signals have only about twenty four days of power left
what we don't know
what destroyed the plane
investigators will need to use information gleaned from the flight recorders and clues from the wreckage to try to find out
the more bits i can put into my mosaic the better my picture will be aviation safety expert michael barr said
the ones who missed the flight
the plane and the pilots
what we know
the airbus operated by airasia's indonesian affiliate had accumulated about twenty three thousand flight hours in about thirteen thousand six hundred flights in six years
the plane's last scheduled maintenance was november sixteen
flight eight thousand five hundred and one's veteran captain iriyanto fifty three had twenty thousand five hundred and thirty seven flying hours six thousand one hundred of them with airasia on the airbus a three hundred and twenty the airline said
the first officer remi emmanuel plesel forty six had two thousand two hundred and seventy five flying hours a reasonable amount for his position
indonesian authorities are looking in to why airasia was flying that particular route on that particular day
the country's transport ministry claims that airasia was permitted to fly it only on mondays tuesdays thursdays and saturdays
airasia said it will cooperate with the inquiry and suspended all service from surabaya to singapore in the meantime
what we don't know
did technical problems or human error have anything to do with the crash 
a major aviation database registers fifty four incidents involving the a three hundred and twenty
some a three hundred and twenty accidents and incidents involve fan cowl detachments landing gear collapse bird strikes and pilot error an expert said
these cause disasters only in very rare cases
meanwhile the u.s. embassy in jakarta issued a security alert saturday after being made aware of a potential threat against u.s. associated hotels and banks in surabaya
a state department official however told cnn that there was no knowledge of any connection between this threat and the air asia flight
no additional information was given regarding the nature of the threat but the embassy recommended heightened vigilance and awareness of one's surroundings when visiting such facilities

red cross and hospital workers run to the front of the hospital in pangkalan bun not even certain how many victims are coming
sirens then announce the arrival of the remains of two innocent souls lost on airasia flight qz eight thousand five hundred and one
unfortunately this little town in indonesia's central kalimantan province has become the focal point for the recovery of bodies and debris from the airliner which failed to complete its journey from surabaya the country's second biggest city to singapore on sunday
orange body bags are loaded onto gurneys and rushed to a separate private wing of the hospital
the unmistakeable smell of death lingers long after the victims have passed
their bodies are then cleaned and treated with chemicals to preserve them
it must be a gruesome and heartbreaking job
this is where the initial identification effort begins
hospital staff assess gender height identifying marks and any clothing
but as time passes the most obvious test facial recognition becomes increasingly difficult
because they have been in the water some days the bodies are bloated but otherwise intact says suyuti syamsul director at the sultan imanuddin hospital
he's been at the hospital twenty four hours a day he tells cnn to ensure the bodies are afforded the respect they deserve
this hospital is not equipped for a tragedy on this scale
they usually have three morticians
they now have forty staff and twenty volunteers focused on treating the bodies
the facility's other patients look on at the growing tragedy that has unfolded in this small town
temporary caskets are being hastily made some literally around the corner from where the bodies are being prepared
syamsul says they will have one hundred and sixty two coffins one for each victim of the doomed flight
he says they are paying the victims every respect possible
representatives of six different religions pray over the bodies before they leave
the victim's religion may not be known but customs must still be observed
their time on earth is over says pastor sirdjon palace
so many of our prayers are for the family
we ask god to receive their bodies and give the families strength
a further six bodies arrived at sultan imanuddin hospital throughout friday
suyuti says fourteen bodies have now come through the hospital so far
as the victims remains are transported out by ambulance to be flown to surabaya for formal identification by distraught families the hospital team takes a breath but just for a moment
the search to the south of pangkalan bun is slow going hampered by rough seas which complicate the job done by divers
with only ten victims recovered from the java sea so far there remain many more that will come through these gates to be tended to by the small but dedicated group of workers here
on standby twenty four hours a day just waiting for the next ten minute warning

placing people of color within a portrait style that historically was the domain of the european elite is a political statement on inequality couched in a beautiful tableaux
helfman's subjects in the historical correction series wear the same aloof expressions of seventeen th century noblemen and women in portraits commissioned from artists like frans hals
light plays across their faces white collars and billowing black vestments in a manner familiar to followers of the dutch and flemish masters
the difference is that their faces are varying shades of brown
helfman sixty one wanted to create historical documentation of a population that never was
the images subvert the obvious storyline that social strata often break down along racial lines
her photos are a contradiction she said to the stories of inequality that are being told in protests across the united states
when i shot them i had the same inspirations but we didn't have issues that were so highly charged as we're dealing with now racially helfman said
in my lifetime i've seen them come up over and over and then something inflames them again and it just shows you we haven't gotten there
helfman stages the subjects of her photos to command respect
she doesn't place other objects in the frame and she shoots from a slightly lower plane to place the model on high
when you get just a little bit of a lower angle you're giving that person power
also a commercial photographer helfman often plays with notions of power and what should be in her fine artwork
she draws inspiration for her art photography from painters like the flemish masters and contemporary photographers like carrie mae weems and seydou keita
helfman enjoys provoking the audience by placing her subjects in unexpected situations many of them involving clothing and culture
one series put young boys in dresses and invited viewers to interpret what and who they were seeing
images from another series depict black women in black face paint dressed as geishas
the longer my series have been out the more even i understand the layers and especially when i hear other people's reaction and other people's comments helfman said
they just kind of take on a life of their own
using gender and race as provocation is fraught with potential pitfalls for helfman a white woman
she takes great care to be respectful often consulting other artists or experts for another cultural point of view
i never want to create something that's tongue in cheek because that defeats the purpose she said
it's disrespectful to the i'm trying to make
what she aims to do she said is make viewers think and rethink
at face value when people look at them it's a beautiful image
you're so easily brought into these and by the time you are you give it some thought and ask some questions

shanghai authorities on friday released details about thirty five of the three dozen new year's revelers killed in a stampede on the city's waterfront wednesday night
the victims were young with an average age of just twenty two
witnesses have described the chaotic harrowing scenes they saw on the bund a popular area in the city to ring in the new year
details of some of the victims have also come to light in state media reports
they included du yijun twenty one a student who had just celebrated her birthday at christmas
friends reportedly described her as quiet but passionate about traditional chinese literature opera and fashion
she went to the new year's eve celebration with her boyfriend a fellow student at shanghai's fudan university
after du died of suffocation her boyfriend posted a heartbreaking message online
losing consciousness in my arms your breath and heartbeat became weaker and weaker
finally they pushed you out of the cold emergency room
i failed to protect you
li na twenty three a migrant worker from a farming family in jiangxi province was looking forward to getting married in two thousand and fifteen
she went to the waterfront festivities with her fiance her older sister and two friends
the group was separated during the stampede
when li's fiance next saw her she had already been declared dead in a hospital
the dead also included a woman from taiwan and another from malaysia
forty nine people were injured in the crush authorities said
twenty nine of them remained hospitalized friday with ten in serious condition
state media reported that shanghai police have acknowledged that they may have underestimated the scale of the crowd that gathered on the bund on wednesday night and failed to deploy enough personnel
although authorities had earlier called off the popular new year's eve light show many revelers apparently unaware of the cancellation still flocked to the bund
the state run news agency xinhua quoted officials as saying that the turnout had reached the previous year's level of about three hundred thousand people by eight thirty p.m. far exceeding government expectations
the cause of the stampede is still being investigated but local media have cited witnesses as saying that it was started when people trying to get to the riverfront promenade clashed with others trying to leave
chinese president xi jinping has demanded an immediate investigation into what happened
he also warned officials nationwide about public safety as the country approaches its biggest holiday of the year the chinese new year in february

francesco perrotti the harbormaster in corigliano calabro said three hundred and sixty migrants were found on the cargo ship ezadeen seventy four under eighteen years of age and four pregnant
the red cross arrived to greet the migrants leaving the ship
all of them appeared to be in good health and nobody was hospitalized or quarantined he said
the migrants were being sent to reception facilities
authorities responded late thursday to a distress call from the ezadeen italy's coast guard said
it's the second rescue of a crewless vessel off italy's coast in what appears to be a worrying new tactic by people traffickers who either abandon the ship or mix with the passengers
overnight the ezadeen was at a standstill fifty eight miles off the city of crotone in the ionian sea the coast guard said where rescuers were trying to restart the boat's engines
the icelandic coast guard said its vessel tyr towed the stranded ship to shore
the tyr was unable to dock at a nearer port because of the ship's limited maneuverability the coast guard said
the tyr was doing surveillance for frontex the european union border management agency when it was called in to help
six italian and four icelandic coast guard crew members boarded the ezadee the italian coast guard said
as well as taking control of the ship they brought food and water for its passengers
un
three thousand died in two thousand and fourteen trying to get to europe
the italian air force and coast guard said that weather conditions had made the rescue operation very challenging with coast guard crew members having to be taken by helicopter to the ship which is flying the flag of sierra leone
the alarm was raised when migrants launched an sos said floriana segreto a spokeswoman for the italian coast guard
since last september she told cnn there have been fifteen similar cargo ships carrying mainly migrants from syria who are wealthier and can pay more than others who are forced to travel on smaller rickety boats
she cited the international organization for migration as saying the price for each passenger was about six thousand euros with a reduction if there are more than two hundred and fifty passengers on board
such cargo ships leave from a greek or turkish port with the migrants already on board she said
they are old merchant ships that should not be navigating in the mediterranean sea she said and still have a flag as in the case of the ezadeen or carry a fake flag
they sail in turkish or greek waters without rousing suspicion and appear to be normal merchant ships segreto said
however once in italian save and rescue operational waters they launch a mayday via satellite phone to a humanitarian association or directly to the italian coast guard she said
the smugglers then either abandon ship or mix in with the migrants
only when all passengers are questioned on shore do investigators have a chance to identify the smugglers segreto said
frontex spokeswoman ewa moncure drew a parallel between what happened on the ezadeen and on the blue sky m a freighter that was also apparently abandoned this week by its crew with almost eight hundred people aboard most believed to be migrants from war torn syria
it docked safely in the southern port of gallipoli on wednesday after the italian coast guard seized control
in each case human traffickers appear to have employed the same method of using large decommissioned cargo ships that have been brought back from the dead moncure said
it's a multimillion dollar business for those operating such ships she said
moncure estimates that each passenger paid three thousand dollar to travel on the ezadeen
while their work is focused on border control frontex vessels provided by eu member states are obliged to help in search and rescue situations moncure said
with ever increasing numbers of migrants from such countries as syria and eritrea putting their lives in the hands of unscrupulous traffickers their efforts are sorely needed
faced with a crisis off its shores italy launched operation mare nostrum to try to find and rescue stranded migrants
it has now scaled back the project which cost italians nine million euros a month from november two thousand and thirteen to the end of two thousand and fourteen
in october the european union announced that frontex would launch its own operation dubbed triton in the central mediterranean to help fill the gap
eu commissioner cecilia malmstrom said the new frontex operation would show concrete solidarity to italy by reinforcing its border surveillance and supporting its humanitarian efforts
but she said it is clear that the triton operation can not and will not replace mare nostrum
while operation mare nostrum is over in name italian naval assets are still carrying out rescues in cooperation with frontex vessels which call them in to help
the san giorgio a navy ship that was converted to rescue migrants under mare nostrum and which was the primary rescue vehicle is still active in such missions and was used last week to rescue those on board the burning greek ferry norman atlantic
it is equipped with an infirmary jail cells for smugglers quarantine sections for potential ebola patients and sleeping quarters for the migrants
cnn went out last month on a frontex patrol on the san mino a japanese fishing vessel converted into a spanish coast guard ship
jose maria duenas commander of the san mino said that the crew do see themselves as search and rescue
we are not turning migrants back we are rescuing them he said
amid continued migrant deaths at sea rights group amnesty international warned last month that triton was vastly reduced in scale and area covered compared with mare nostrum and called on eu nations to step up their efforts
people are still taking these dangerous sea routes to get to europe
if the eu is serious about preventing the mediterranean from becoming a cemetery it must be prepared to deploy search and rescue operations all along the routes that desperate refugees and migrants are taking said john dalhuisen amnesty international's director for europe and central asia
a spokeswoman for the eu commission said friday that it was closely following the ezadeen situation
the rescues of the blue sky m two days ago and of the ezadeen show that smugglers are finding new ways to enter eu territory she said
to prevent such events and to protect the lives of migrants fighting smuggling will continue to be a priority under the commission's agenda for comprehensive migration in two thousand and fifteen
more than two hundred and seven thousand people crossed the mediterranean for europe illegally in two thousand and fourteen the high commissioner for refugees the u.n. refugee agency said last month almost three times the previous high of about seventy thousand in two thousand and eleven
that's sixty percents of roughly three hundred and forty eight thousand boat migrants worldwide last year
europe facing conflicts to its south east and south east is seeing the largest number of sea arrivals the unhcr said
more than three thousand four hundred of those seeking to reach europe last year died many of them drowning after being trafficked in unseaworthy vessels from the shores of the middle east and north africa across the mediterranean


i also had someone grabbing my hair from the back struggling and breathing heavily zuo said
a girl in front of me held me desperately and said help me help me please
i can't make it anymore 
there was also a girl completely motionless underneath
zuo was one among many people caught up in the stampede on the bund an area along the huangpu river in china's most populous city that draws big crowds for new year's eve festivities
he described his traumatic experience on weibo a chinese social media platform on which he's a verified user
the stampede which began roughly twenty five minutes before midnight killed thirty six people and injured forty seven others the shanghai city government said
many of the victims were female students state media reported
girls crying and shouting for help 
i was surrounded by the sounds of girls crying and shouting for help with their last strain of effort and of people fighting and throwing curses at each other said zuo who works in the media sector
another witness twenty eight year old tian ye who works in import export logistics told cnn how he'd gone down to the waterfront to enjoy the festivities because he lives nearby
instead he found himself only about thirty meters from the scene of the deadly crush
when me and other young men saw people had fainted we rushed there to do cpr and carried them to the ambulance and police cars he said
the stampede lasted only about thirty seconds he said but it took about ten minutes to carry everyone out
there were way too many people stuck down there without a clear entrance or exit
people got stuck and panicked
a lot of police gathered in that central area but more police could have eased the consequences he said
when someone fell down people behind would think the crowd is moving so more people were moving forward and falling
he blamed what happened on overcrowding people's lack of awareness of how to protect themselves and on heavy traffic that blocked ambulances from getting to the scene sooner
but i'm happy to see everyone around me fighting to help others after the tragedy he added
no conspiracy no predesign it's a tragedy triggered by multiple factors
we tried our best wish them rest in peace
a third witness xiao ji said he was at the side of the mass of people as a night of celebration turned into scenes of horror
i stared for a while and then started pulling people out of the crowds xiao who works at a technology company said on weibo
exhausted after hauling two people out of the crush he said all he could do was hold their hands and try to cheer them up a little bit
in the chaos described by xiao some people were trying to revive unconscious victims and others were simply wailing
police officers were also trying to help
after he regained strength xiao says he joined in again
a photo from china's state run news agency xinhua showed people receiving treatment as they lay in the middle of a crowded street
people lying on the ground were a complete mess said zuo
their faces became unrecognizable
it remains unclear what caused the stampede
authorities are investigating what happened
xinhua cited one unidentified witness as saying that people started scrambling after coupons that looked like dollar bills were thrown from the third floor of a building
but the shanghai police said their investigation had ruled out this possibility
police said that based on surveillance camera footage the items were tossed about ten minutes after the stampede and did not cause much commotion
they were coupons from a bar on the bund
zuo xiao tian and other witnesses also made no mention of the coupons in their accounts
and the english language newspaper shanghai daily cited witnesses as saying that the stampede started when a large number of people trying to move up to the riverfront esplanade were blocked
cnn reached out to zuo and xiao for further comment but zuo didn't immediately respond and xiao declined to talk to the media
local officials had this year moved a popular new year's eve light show from an open area of the bund to a more enclosed area citing safety concerns shanghai daily reported
last year officials were caught off guard when nearly three hundred thousand people turned up for the new year countdown at the bund which led to traffic chaos the newspaper said
officials canceled another new year's celebration late wednesday in front of beijing's tallest skyscraper citing safety concerns
even with the light show and official countdown called off many revelers remained at the location and had their own countdown there
the shanghai stampede prompted scenes of anger and grief
video from the reuters news agency showed people sobbing in a hospital waiting room
one woman told state broadcaster cctv that relatives had been waiting for hours for information about their loved ones
a photo from agence france presse showed people facing off with security guards at a hospital
dozens of people gathered at the scene of the stampede thursday laying bouquets of flowers on the ground
police cars lined an intersection near where the deadly chaos took place
chinese president xi jinping requested an immediate investigation into what happened and said a profound lesson should be learned from the events xinhua reported thursday
zuo spelled out what he learned from the terrible end to two thousand and fourteen
don't attend big gatherings like that ever again

kim jong un is not officially on speaking terms with south korean president park geun hye
but on thursday in his new year's address he said that could change
last week north korea's government news agency branded park's election as fraudulent and her father himself a former president a dictator
but in his televised speech for the first time ever the communist leader said he'd talk with park south korean news agency yonhap reported
depending on the mood and circumstances to be created we have no reason not to hold the highest level talks kim said
north korea's state news agency did not publish those remarks in the official transcript of kim's speech
his words may represent a small glacial budge but that doesn't mean things will keep moving yonhap cautioned
still kim spoke in detail about the need to improve north south relations
in between bellicose bantering particularly against the south's military partnership with the united states there have been momentary thaws
three months ago some of the north's highest officials paid a snap friendly visit to the south that sparked excited live television coverage
and this past monday seoul's unification minister ryoo kihl jae sent a fax to pyongyang suggesting cabinet ministers on both sides to meet in january yonhap reported
the south and the north will have to meet each other and discuss ways toward peaceful reunification ryoo later told journalists
reunification is what both sides are pushing for
we should make fresh headway in the national reunification movement for this year kim said in thursday's address according to the official transcript published by the north's korean central news agency
but they have pursued it on starkly different terms
president park last year announced a two thousand and fifteen road map to reunification which she laid out in a speech in april in dresden germany yonhap has reported
dresden was part of east germany back when germany was divided between the democratic west and soviet communist east and south koreans have drawn hope from that country's reunification for the possible realization of their own
park's talk has been called the dresden declaration
since then the south has sought support from its international allies for park's reunification plan selling a single korea as an economic boon to a global free market yonhap has reported
the north has railed against this fearing the economically muscular south aided by other capitalist countries would in a reunification effectively digest the north
kim does not want seoul's allies involved and criticized the south's diplomatic efforts again on thursday
to go on a tour around foreign countries touting for international cooperation in resolving the inter korean relations issue the one related with our nation is a humiliating treachery of leaving its destiny in the hands of outside forces he said
but kim's conciliatory words following after the south's offer to talk again and his hints of moving talks up to the highest level could be significant
ryoo who extended that invitation is also park's right hand in her reunification effort yonhap reported
he said his offer to talk was in line with the two thousand and fifteen road map
but kim's speech was not all conciliatory
some of it was bellicose
he commended his forces showdown with the imperialists possibly a reference to caustic reactions to south korean u.s. military exercises
the dictator also praised political killings in his own ranks
our party detected and purged the anti party counterrevolutionary factionalists at an opportune time and with a correct decision the kcna speech transcript said
south korean intelligence officials said that members of the north's ruling party were shot by firing squad for viewing a south korean soap opera
and there are additional pressure points that have derailed seoul pyongyang agreements in the past such as the floating of messages via balloon by activists in the south into the north
north korean soldiers opening fire on these balloons last year struck south korean territory
there were no reported injuries or damage
the north sees the balloons as a violation of its borders
the south sees them as an exercise of free speech
the south imposed an economic sanctions package on the north in two thousand and ten over the attack on a south korean navy ship that killed forty six sailors
seoul demands that pyongyang take responsibility for torpedoing the vessel before it lifts the sanctions

the sound of gunfire marked new year's eve in the tense disputed region of kashmir between india and pakistan
pakistani rangers shot and killed an indian soldier india's military said
india's military shot and killed two pakistani rangers pakistan's military said
both sides claimed that the other started the gunfight
indian military spokesman dharminder parikh said pakistani rangers opened fire unprovoked at indian positions in the samba sector of indian administered kashmir as the old year was coming to a close
a second indian border soldier was wounded in the fight he said
pakistan's punjab rangers said that their indian counterparts had a meeting and when two rangers contacted them the indian side opened fire
the two were wounded and later died they said
the two nuclear armed south asian neighbors had agreed to a bilateral ceasefire in border regions in november two thousand and three and the agreement held for years
but there have been breaches in recent years
kashmir has been in the throes of separatist violence since one thousand nine hundred and eighty nine which has claimed over forty three thousand lives
indian soldiers killed in gunfight with militants in kashmir

searchers looking for more bodies and wreckage from airasia flight qz eight thousand five hundred and one continue to be hindered by tough weather conditions
ships planes and helicopters are being used to try to find victims of the disaster
most of the people on board the flight remain missing and search teams are still looking for the main wreckage of the plane
efforts are being concentrated in a zone covering one thousand five hundred and seventy five square nautical miles that officials believe is the most probable area to find the remains of the aircraft
but on friday waves in the java sea as high as four meters were making it hard for divers search underwater
the weather is the biggest obstacle said bambang hermanu chief of police in indonesia's central kalimantan province where much of the search operation is based
here's more key information about where things stand on flight qz eight thousand five hundred and one
what we know
the aircraft took off early sunday from surabaya indonesia bound for singapore
roughly thirty five minutes into the flight the pilot asked air traffic control for permission to turn left and climb to a higher altitude to avoid bad weather
minutes later the plane disappeared from air traffic control's radar
what we don't know
what happened on board after contact with the plane was lost
no distress call was received
indonesian aviation authorities have suggested that the plane ascended despite permission being denied because of traffic
some experts have speculated that the aircraft might have experienced an aerodynamic stall because of a lack of speed or from flying at too sharp an angle to get enough lift
analysts have also suggested that the pilots might not have been getting information from onboard systems about the plane's position or that rain or hail from thunderstorms in the area could have damaged the engines
until the main wreckage of the plane is found along with the flight recorders experts have little evidence to support their theories
what we know
search teams found debris and some bodies in the water tuesday one hundred to two hundred kilometers from the aircraft's last known location over the java sea indonesia's search and rescue agency said
thirty bodies have so far been recovered from the sea indonesian officials said friday
early friday what appears to be a piece of the fuselage was found singapore's defense ministry said
it resembles a window panel
the uss sampson the u.s. navy ship that is helping with the search recovered two bodies thursday the u.s
seventh fleet said friday
indonesia is leading the international search effort with assistance from a range of countries including malaysia singapore and the united states
what we don't know
the exact location of the body of the aircraft
an indonesian search official told cnn on wednesday that he thought sonar equipment had detected wreckage from flight eight thousand five hundred and one at the bottom of the java sea
but the country's search and rescue chief said the plane hadn't been found yet
bad weather has hindered the search operation
the ones who missed the flight
what we know
the plane was carrying one hundred and fifty five passengers and seven crew members
the overwhelming majority of those on board were indonesians
there were also citizens of britain france malaysia singapore and south korea
details are emerging about some of the people on the flight recounted by family members and friends
what we don't know
when the missing passengers and crew members will be recovered
indonesian authorities have identified four of the recovered bodies so far
the first victim they identified an indonesian woman named hayati lutfiah hamid was buried thursday
many family members are waiting in surabaya for news about their loved ones
what we know
the key to understanding what happened may be in the aircraft's cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder commonly known as black boxes
the black boxes which are actually orange are in the tail of airbus three hundred and twenty two hundred s. if recovered they will be taken to a lab in jakarta indonesia to be analyzed said tatang kurniadi head of indonesia's national committee for transportation safety
the batteries powering the pingers that send acoustic signals have only about twenty five days of power left he said
what we don't know
where the plane's remains might have been taken by the elements
investigators will need to use information gleaned from the flight recorders and clues from the wreckage
the more bits i can put into my mosaic the better my picture will be aviation safety expert michael barr said
the better the picture the better i can come up with an understanding of what happened
but the conditions at sea make that work much more difficult than on land
in the water you are working with currents and winds and so the pieces won't be where they had the initial impact he said
what happens next 
the plane and the pilots
what we know
the six year old airbus a three hundred and twenty two hundred operated by airasia's indonesian affiliate had accumulated around twenty three thousand flight hours in about thirteen thousand six hundred flights according to airbus
the plane's last scheduled maintenance was on november sixteen
flight eight thousand five hundred and one's veteran captain iriyanto fifty three had twenty thousand five hundred and thirty seven flying hours six thousand one hundred of them with airasia on the airbus a three hundred and twenty the airline said
the first officer remi emmanuel plesel forty six had two thousand two hundred and seventy five flying hours a reasonable amount for his position
what we don't know
whether technical problems human error or other issues were involved in the crash
according to information from the aviation safety network accident database there have been fifty four incidents involving the a three hundred and twenty
in the a three hundred and twenty family accidents and incidents range from fan cowl detachment landing gear collapse bird strikes right through to hull losses through pilot error said kane ray an analyst with the international bureau of aviation a global aviation consulting group
most aircraft have teething problems and in most cases these are eradicated
very rarely these issues cause disasters largely because of a culmination of factors that lead to the event ray said

peter greste mohamed fadel fahmy and baher mohamed were convicted in june of supporting the banned muslim brotherhood
greste and fahmy were sentenced to seven years in prison and mohamed to ten years
the muslim brotherhood a religious and political group was banned in egypt and labeled a terrorist organization after president mohamed morsy's ouster in two thousand and thirteen
he was egypt's first democratically elected leader after the arab spring uprising
tv cameras were not allowed in thursday's hearing in the court of cassation and the incarcerated journalists were also absent from the courtroom
the men's families were disappointed at the outcome
they had hoped the court would throw out the case and release them or at least free them on bail pending retrial but they remain behind bars
the retrial date has not yet been set
this was not good as we hoped for lois greste mother of australian journalist peter greste told reporters at the court
i believe in his innocence 
lawyers for the three defendants asked the court for their release but told reporters that the chances were slim
fahmy's lawyers asked for his deportation to canada he is egyptian canadian taking advantage of a new law allowing a president to deport defendants
the judge overseeing the retrial will decide on their release said amr el deeb a lawyer for peter greste and mohamed
greste's brothers mike and andrew greste expressed mixed feelings about the court's decision
it's a step in the right direction
obviously it's a little disappointing that we didn't get the most positive outcome but on reflection it's certainly the next best result for us mike greste told cnn affiliate seven network australia
but greste's family hopes egypt's government will make use of other legal avenues to free his brother peter sooner
following instruction from peter and the family peter's egyptian lawyer lodged an application with the egyptian attorney general's office to have peter deported pursuant to a presidential decree that was issued in november andrew greste said
we believe there is now a window of opportunity for the egyptian president to exercise his presidential power under the decree he greste said
fahmy's fiancee marwa omara said they planned to marry despite his incarceration
we will hold our wedding vows inside the prison she said
i believe it's a message to the whole world that mohamed is innocent and i believe in his innocence
and it is a personal message to him that i love him and i know that he is innocent
fahmy's brother adel fahmy said the whole family had shared in the journalist's ordeal
it's the epitome of injustice what happened he said
he lost a year and more now of his life
we are suffering as a family severely for my brother as all the families are for their loved ones
and i can't describe in words what we've been through this year
in a statement issued after the ruling al jazeera urged egyptian authorities to move swiftly to a retrial
lawyers point out that the appeal process from this point could take another twelve to eighteen months the broadcaster said
baher peter and mohamed have been unjustly in jail for over a year now an al jazeera spokesman said
the egyptian authorities have a simple choice free these men quickly or continue to string this out all the while continuing this injustice and harming the image of their own country in the eyes of the world
they should choose the former
there has been wide international condemnation of egypt's prosecution of the three journalists who deny wrongdoing
the united states australia and european union have all called for the men to be freed as have rights groups including amnesty international the committee to protect journalists and the international press institute
the appeal was accepted because of procedural errors in the trial that led to the conviction
the men had appeared in a special court created to handle terrorism cases which may in retrospect be considered illegal
prosecutors are now expected to present the same case in a new court
the three journalists have been imprisoned in cairo since december two thousand and thirteen on charges that included conspiring with the muslim brotherhood spreading false news and endangering national security
they have steadfastly denied the charges as has al jazeera and the prosecution put forward no evidence to support the allegations
prosecutors were criticized for presenting evidence that was purportedly made up or irrelevant to the case like videos of greste's old news reports from other countries
amnesty international has said that greste fahmy and mohamed are pawns in a geopolitical dispute between egypt and qatar the tiny but oil rich middle eastern country that finances al jazeera
qatar has long been perceived as a supporter of the muslim brotherhood which was declared a terrorist organization just days before the al jazeera journalists were arrested at the cairo hotel where they were working
with saudi mediation however there has been a recent improvement in egyptian qatari relations
president abdel fattah el sisi met with a qatari envoy in december and the meeting was followed by al jazeera's decision to suspend its egyptian mubasher masr channel
this channel is already banned by an egyptian court and was at the center of the journalists trial even though they work for the network's english language channel
omara fahmy's fiancee welcomed the apparent improvement in the two countries relations
i hope the reconciliation between egypt and qatar can lead to a better outcome she said
it's very hard for us to feel that they will stay for a year in prison
it's very tough
they did nothing

but thanks to authorities a ship on course to crash against the rocky italian coast was stopped in time saving passengers and averting a possible environmental catastrophe
italian coast guard commander filippo marini said the vessel was cruising on autopilot toward the coast at six nautical miles per hour
when it entered italian search and rescue waters the coast guard sent helicopters with six men who boarded the ship and took control
the course of the vessel was reversed to avoid a collision with the rocks and it was piloted instead to gallipoli in italy's southern puglia region
it docked safely there wednesday
the freighter carried seven hundred and ninety six migrants the coast guard said thursday most believed to be from war torn syria
authorities on wednesday put the number of migrants on board at seven hundred and sixty eight
the crew of the blue sky m apparently jumped ship
the coast guard said a collision would not only have led to the deaths of passengers but would also have created an environmental disaster
it said a real disaster was avoided
the freighter sent a distress signal near the greek island of corfu on tuesday alerting italian and greek authorities to the situation on board
the greek merchant marine ministry and the greek navy have said the pilot of a greek helicopter that flew over the cargo ship spoke with the captain who said the ship was not in distress and did not need assistance
floriana segreto a spokeswoman for the italian coast guard in rome said there were no deaths related to the blue sky m incident
she added that about one hundred people have been hospitalized mainly because of the cold and exhaustion
it was not immediately clear where the migrants will go
the authorities will investigate what happened to the crew and how the freighter reached italy's waters

but let's start with the bad news
isis is not going away
no one is predicting a swift defeat of isis the self proclaimed islamic state which has proved resilient in the six months since its sudden sweep through iraq to the fringes of baghdad
the easy pickings are fewer the challenge of governing sapping air strikes debilitating
and a new iraqi prime minister haider al abadi has begun to mend bridges with the country's sunni minority and reorganize the army
but isis is still as much on the offensive as the defensive
it appears to accept the ebb and flow of conflict switching between holding territory and classic terror tactics
it is constantly seeking ways to stretch iraqi forces which are still very much a work in slow progress
perhaps isis best hope in iraq in coming months is that sunnis north of baghdad will turn to it if shia dominated militia persecute them
isis greatest vulnerability will be the expensive and labor intensive job of governing
providing social services power and water ensuring food supplies
there are already plenty of signs in iraq's second city mosul especially that isis is failing on most of these counts
at some point in two thousand and fifteen iraqi security forces will look to retake mosul but predictions of a new year offensive seem optimistic
in syria there are signs that isis is looking to open up new fronts south of damascus and toward the lebanese border either itself or by co opting other factions
it holds territory north of aleppo ready to take advantage of other rebel groups being pummeled by the assad regime
the syrian battlefield is very complicated with alliances coming and going in a country of dozens of factions that spend as much time fighting each other as they do bashar assad
military victory for the government or its opponents is as unlikely in two thousand and fifteen as it was in two thousand and fourteen or two thousand and thirteen
joshua landis a longtime syria watcher at the university of oklahoma says the somalia izaton of the country is inevitable so long as the international community degrades all centers of power in syria and the opposition fails to unite
only a political settlement will end the bloodshed as was the case in lebanon and bosnia in decades past
but that too appears remote despite russia taking on the mantle of mediator
the strongest factions include isis and the al qaeda affiliate al nusra while moderate groups favored by the international community have lost ground
even so waging war for three years has taken its toll on the regime
aron lund in syria comment expects the regime's fraying base
finances infrastructure and perhaps manpower to become a critical factor in the coming year noting its difficulty in fielding enough capable troops
and the regime's main allies iran and russia are among the countries hit by lower oil prices
the three million syrians who have become refugees face another year in tents and shelters with two thirds of the children receiving little or no schooling according to unicef
iraqi foreign minister ibrahim al jaafari recently compared the rise of isis with the thirty years war that tore apart much of europe in the seventeen th century
it's difficult to argue with him as fifty shades of jihadism spread across the arab world from benghazi in libya to sanaa in yemen
four of the region's largest countries are in the throes of civil war
the situation in libya has deteriorated throughout two thousand and fourteen. now a chaotic mix of tribal and jihadist groups fight for territory and oil while a parliament evicted from tripoli stands powerless on the sidelines
oil production is less than a quarter of the level four years ago
expect the situation in libya to get still worse in two thousand and fifteen with the absence of state authority also encouraging bigger flows of illegal migrants from sub saharan africa to the mediterranean
libya's chaos is likely to spill over affecting weak neighbors like niger and the presence of jihadist camps in the desert may invite egyptian military action
u.s. president barack obama recognized the long term problems in the arab world and america's limited ability to intervene in his year end national public radio interview
when it comes to what is going to be a generational project in a place like libya or a place like syria or a place like iraq we can help but we can't do it for them he said
obama made it clear that in the last twenty four months of his presidency that he would not be rushed into nation rebuilding in the middle east or anywhere else saying the pundits in washington think you can just move chess pieces around the table
and whenever we have that kind of hubris we tend to get burned
obama also spoke of strategic patience which is very much on show in washington's gradual reaching out to tehran
a common enemy isis has led to a tacit understanding between the united states and iran
whether that opens the window to a broader relationship and whether negotiations on iran's nuclear program will succeed is one of the big questions of two thousand and fifteen
deadlines for agreement on limiting iran's nuclear program have come and gone
the next is july
the obama administration has invested heavily in seeking a deal since president hassan rouhani's election in two thousand and thirteen and rouhani is keen to show the iranian people he can end their economic and political isolation
obama in his year end interview with npr said he believed there are elements inside of iran that recognize the opportunity and want to take it
hardliners in iran may see such an opening as undermining their influence and opening the door to all sorts of western influences
the momentum appears to be flowing against them but the gaps between tehran and the international community remain formidable
perhaps the best to be expected is an interim deal that further eases sanctions
it seemed like happy christmas
war is over in kabul as the international security assistance force this week lowered the flag and ended combat missions
the taliban marked the ceremony by mocking the west for wasting billions of dollars and hundreds of lives
training and assistance to the afghan military will continue with some thirteen thousand troops most of them american staying on under operation resolute support
some will conduct anti terrorism operations but are unlikely to be enough to stave off the taliban's resurgence in southern provinces
we will also find out whether hamid karzai's successor as afghan president ashraf ghani can improve the regional dynamics
ironically one of the worst tragedies of two thousand and fourteen the pakistan taliban attack on a school in peshawar may help him
for years pakistan and afghanistan have traded accusations alleging the other supports terrorist groups
while the afghan taliban use pakistani soil as a rear base so the pakistani taliban slip into afghanistan to avoid the military and to resupply
cnn's nic robertson on the horror of pakistan school massacre
the day after the school atrocity a senior pakistani military official flew to kabul to meet ghani
pakistan clearly wants action against the masterminds of the attack at least one of whom was purportedly in afghanistan
ghani will want a quid pro quo which pakistan may be reluctant to provide
it has always seen the afghan taliban and associated groups like the haqqani network as a tool against indian influence in afghanistan
but the two governments already are stepping up border cooperation
it's rare that one event changes the direction of a region but there does appear to be a rare window of opportunity for a more concerted campaign against terrorism
the history of the region suggests it may not stay open long
and the rugged territory of the region favors the insurgents
by most forecasts the world will be heavily reliant on the united states and china to drive growth this year
goldman sachs forecasts u.s. growth of three percents and china's at seven percents while much of europe scrapes into positive territory
the numbers may be improved by the suddenly lower price of oil
the international monetary fund says the sharp fall in the price of crude should add nearly one percents to global growth
many analysts expect the price to recover slightly but only a catastrophe on the production side would see the price back above one hundred dollar a barrel
for europe the united states and china a lower oil price is good news
it's essentially a tax cut for consumers
the economist estimates that the average u.s. motorist could save eight hundred dollar
but economies heavily reliant on oil revenues nigeria russia and venezuela for example will suffer
so may heavily indebted oil companies
for every one dollar drop in the price of crude venezuela is estimated to lose some seven hundred million dollar in revenue making it difficult to service debt and fund basic imports
stagnant global demand and the rise in u.s. shale oil production are two reasons for the fall in crude prices
saudi arabia's decision not to cut its production is another
some oil analysts believe the saudis are trying to retain their market share and make nonconventional sources such as shale less viable
look out for bankruptcies among smaller shale producers
but for russia another problem
one of the safest predictions for two thousand and fifteen is that russians will have a tough year
besides the sliding oil price high interest rates to defend a vulnerable ruble a shrinking economy and financial sanctions are a toxic combination
the unanswerable question is how president vladimir putin will respond
will he double down seeking closer ties with china india and the rest of asia and causing mischief in the baltics 
or will the kremlin see the destabilization of ukraine as not worth the candle 
jeffrey tayler in foreign policy asks whether needing to distract his people from ever direr economic straits putin could foment separatist sentiment in say the majority russian estonian town of narva
putin certainly sees an historic struggle under way
he told the duma in december that the policy of containment by western powers was not invented yesterday
it has been carried out against our country for many years always for decades if not centuries
to moscow ukraine's bid for nato membership is the latest iteration of that policy
but russia's and ukraine's weakness may also provide scope for a deal
ukraine satisfies few of the conditions for nato membership and is unlikely to for years
what if obama and german chancellor angela merkel dangled guarantees that the alliance will keep ukraine at arm's length and gradually eliminate sanctions in return for an end to the russian sponsored rebellion in eastern ukraine 
but until this frozen conflict finds a solution russian companies will suffer unable to tap into international credit markets and more than ever reliant on loyalty to the kremlin
and russian citizens standard of living will be hurt by inflation and crippling interest rates
cheaper oil just may help europe dodge another recession
but the european central bank is not taking any chances
it's planning to take a page from the playbook of the u.s. federal reserve through a massive program of quantitative easing to buy sovereign bonds and shock the european economy into life

if ecb president mario draghi and oil can't drag europe back into growth the popular mood will continue to darken benefiting parties like the anti immigration anti europe ukip in britain and protest party podemos in spain
the british vote is in may and few dare to predict the outcome
but it seems very likely that one or more of the smaller parties will be involved in coalition negotiations and the historic decline in the vote of the labour and conservative parties will continue
that same fragmentation has occurred in greece where snap elections could bring the radical anti eu syriza to power unstitching the complex rescue that kept greece inside the eurozone
mujtaba rahman of the eurasia group says a syriza government in greece part of a wider shift toward populism in europe will have the potential to generate contagion to france and italy where unemployment is high and incumbent governments unpopular
across europe the political establishment is under siege from this populism which on the left wants vast programs of public works and an end to austerity and on the right a hard line against immigration and european integration

a historic transition in under way in china
the pivot from an economy based on being the workshop of the world into one more sustained by domestic demand
the chinese leadership is walking a fine line between growth and introducing structural reforms that include a crackdown on institutional corruption and curbing what's known as shadow banking risky and loosely regulated lending estimated to be worth nearly five dollar trillion
the coming year will be a critical stage in that transition
one low boil conflict that will endure in two thousand and fifteen is beijing's determination to remake the map of the south china sea of which it claims eighty percents
this assertive nationalism is driven by the promise of oil and gas and the importance of the region's shipping lanes
new chinese passports show the nine dash line invented a century ago and brushing the territorial waters of vietnam malaysia indonesia and the philippines
there have already been confrontations over some remote pacific shoals
other governments are queuing up to challenge china in international forums
more skirmishes seem likely in the coming year and the u.s. is being drawn into the dispute after recently rejecting the nine dash line
another testing ground for the world's two largest economies will be trade
the recent u.s. china agreement to reduce tariffs on information technology goods is a hopeful sign but edward alden at the council for foreign relations notes that big developing countries like china india and brazil have matured into global players in their own right making it harder to reach deals than it was when the united states and europe called most of the shots
a raft of international meetings in two thousand and fifteen will be critical for the way the world manages trade
the trans pacific partnership between the u.s. and asian countries the transatlantic trade and investment partnership and world trade organization talks
none will be easy but republican control may actually help the obama administration get fast track congressional approval for any agreements
critical to the fate of the doha round of wto talks will be the attitude of india a country where vested interests have long opposed liberalization in trade and services
narendra modi's bjp party came to power on a pro business platform and its bilateral agreement with the united states in two thousand and fourteen on food security paves the way for progress on the doha round
it's also important for the wto's future
if the doha round dies trade may become more about bilateral and bloc deals
the history of trade negotiations is that they always take longer than anticipated so we may have to revisit the topic a year from now
now insert the word climate for trade in that last sentence and double it
the world has been waiting for meaningful progress on talks to curb carbon emissions since the copenhagen summit five years ago

a lot is riding on the paris conference to be held in december
in the wake of the preparatory meeting in lima peru in november it seems ambitions have been pared to the lowest common denominator
a final deal will be based on national plans to be submitted by individual governments by april one
lima also produced a fudge on the issue of how developing nations would contribute to overall goals
few environmental groups are optimistic that anything meaningful and binding will emerge in paris and the fund to help emerging nations adapt their infrastructure is worth a tenth of the one hundred billion dollar target
in the last few weeks a little vehicle called curiosity was trundling across a crater on mars when it picked up wild fluctuations in methane levels
why would this be exciting 
on earth most methane is produced biologically
some of it is millions of years old found deep underground
if the same were true of mars it would indicate some form of primitive life on the planet
much more needs to be done to identify the origin of the methane
but michael mumma a senior scientist at nasa's goddard space flight center told scientific american the discovery was very exciting because it very clearly shows methane has a source on the planet
maybe in two thousand and fifteen curiosity will come across another spike in methane and can gather enriched air samples which would help researchers identify the source of the methane
the presence of carbon twelve the scientists say would be cause for real excitement as it would indicate a biological origin
it's a prosaic description of a complex and powerful phenomenon that is about to land on us a massive surge in the data showing what we do when and where
none of this happens in a calendar year of course but by two thousand and twenty according to it industry analysts gartner there will be twenty six billion connected devices generating and consuming data assisted by the explosion in wearable technology such as smart glasses and watches
so businesses will invest heavily in two thousand and fifteen in data storage analysis and retrieval
knowing how to classify the data what to keep and what to discard what to hold locally and what to store in the cloud will all be critical to smart use of this insane amount of information
susan hauser of microsoft expects businesses to make use of big data services in the cloud and we expect machine learning to grow exponentially across the retail manufacturing and health care sectors
deep learning will be a big part of this process whereby computers are designed to behave more like the human brain thanks to deep neural networks enabling them to learn through observation
we are getting close to the point where machines will make better decisions than us
as anthony wing kosner writes in forbes
this will not be the year that eighty percents of the developed world loses their jobs to intelligent machines but it is not too soon to start figuring out what to do about that eventuality
maybe one of them will be writing this column next year
the governing body of world football fifa has spent the last year embroiled in crisis over the way russia and especially qatar were chosen to host the next two world cups
an inquiry was commissioned but its findings were so heavily interpreted that the author u.s. attorney michael garcia quit in disgust
now fifa's governing committee says it will publish a redacted version of the report
the question is whether this will bring about real reform at fifa where sepp blatter has reigned supreme for sixteen years thanks to solid support from football's backwaters
he faces re election in may and will need all that support
despite persistent grumbling about siting the world cup in qatar given its climate and protests about casualties among workers building the stadiums there it would be an enormous admission of failure on fifa's part to reopen the contest
blatter is an astute tactician and a proven survivor
odds are if he wants another term he will get it
which many in football would see as another own goal by fifa

thailand's massively popular songkran festival held in celebration of the new solar year is basically one nationwide water fight
but it didn't start out that way
originally families and friends celebrated songkran by visiting temples and pouring water on each other's hands and buddha statues as a blessing to start the year filled with good luck
though these traditions continue over the years people started to engage in water fights in the streets a welcome form of relief given that april is the hottest month of the year

the girl was arrested in the early hours of december twenty three at a staircase leading to the central government offices in the city's admiralty district and was detained by police for seventeen hours said patricia ho the lawyer acting for the teen
a judge ruled in a youth court on monday that the girl should be sent to a children's home for twenty days until january nineteen
on wednesday local media reported the girl was released from the children's home on bail
the wall known as the lennon wall was once covered with colorful post it notes and messages of support for the recent pro democracy protests in hong kong
when the protests were cleared the notes were removed as well
protestors started placing notes on the wall as a show of defiance after police used tear gas on demonstrators at the start of the protest which lead to a two month occupation of the main road outside the central government office
the wall was named after the late beatles star john lennon and contained messages of support for the protests and references to his song imagine
ho said the move was premature and disproportionate
it wasn't an application by the social welfare department as it usually would be she said
police threw in a bunch of facts they obtained about the family in a very superficial manner
meanwhile the court is considering an application by hong kong police that she be removed from the care of her father who according to ho is seriously hearing impaired and can not understand the case
the move has angered activists
student activist group scholarism have set up a petition protesting the court ruling and some protestors have started drawing on the road as a protest outside the children's home in tuen mun where the teenager is being held
gary tsang who participated in hong kong's pro democracy street occupations told cnn the teen was an innocent political prisoner and the use of the law in this case was obviously politically motivated
the government fears young people as they thinks young people have nothing to lose he said
another protestor anson chui told cnn the police have lost their common sense and said there would be more similar arrests
most
know that we can not really cause any damage on the wall by drawing with chalk he said
it is just an excuse used by the police to make us fear
especially when the court said they are taking away the girl from her father
the move comes after police also made an application for a care or protection order for a teenage boy who was arrested during the clearance of another protest site in mong kok earlier this month
the court file said the boy's parents failed to exercise proper guardianship over him
the court dates for both teenagers will take place in january
a small protest camp outside the legislative council still remains and there is a small police presence on the site
police officers are guarding lennon wall and remove all notes posted to it at the end of each day
new year's eve countdown events at popular shopping districts such as causeway bay and tsim sha tsui were canceled because of fears that protestors would attempt to hijack the events

hong kong police have not responded to requests for comment



seven of the victims including two children were found inside a house in north edmonton said edmonton police chief ron knecht
this series of events are not believed to be random acts and there is no risk to the broader public he said
these events do not appear to be gang related but rather tragic incidents of domestic violence
this is the worst mass violence in edmonton a city of about eight hundred and twelve thousand people in the western canada province of alberta since six people were killed in one thousand nine hundred and fifty six knecht said
knecht said none of the victims have been identified but all are connected
knecht said officers first went to a residence in southwest edmonton about seven p.m. monday after receiving a weapons complaint
it is alleged a male entered a private residence discharged a firearm and fled he said
about eight thirty p.m. monday police received a call asking them to check on a man at a house in north edmonton knecht said
according to the family the male seemed depressed and overly emotional knecht said
the family was concerned the male might be suicidal
police didn't receive a response when they went to the house and noticed nothing suspicious the chief said
around twelve thirty a.m. tuesday police received more information and returned to the house in north edmonton
inside they found seven people dead
three adult women two adult males a male child and a female child knecht said
knecht said police were told at two twenty a.m. tuesday that a black suv connected to the first killing had been seen near a restaurant in fort saskatchewan about twenty miles from edmonton
police surrounded the business and determined at eight forty five a.m. that a man inside the restaurant was dead from an apparent self inflicted gunshot wound knecht said
police said he is the man whose family had been worried about his welfare the night before
we are not looking for other suspects knecht said
alberta premier jim prentice said we trust that the police agencies investigations will help provide answers as we struggle to understand this tragic turn of events
in the meantime on behalf of the government of alberta i extend our deepest condolences to the people affected by this incident and our appreciation to public servants who provided a professional response during what must have been dangerous and difficult circumstances

boko haram rebels drew international condemnation when they kidnapped more than two hundred schoolgirls from chibok in april many of whom they said they sold into slavery
in the latest raid scores of boko haram fighters armed with guns and petrol bombs stormed the remote farming village of kautikari on motorcycles early tuesday shooting randomly and torching homes
the attackers urged residents not to flee saying they were in the village to find selected targets
the gunmen killed fifteen people mostly youth vigilantes who keep watch on the village against boko haram attacks said adamu kolomgunna who fled the village for the town of maiduguri
the attackers hurled petrol bombs into homes causing fire that destroyed several houses he said
the village has been deserted by all able bodied men leaving only the old and children kolomgunna said
the gunmen left the village after the raid warning residents not to stand in their way when they carry out attacks said silas bitrus another resident who gave a similar death toll
this was the second deadly raid on kautikari by boko haram insurgents in recent months
on june twenty nine boko haram gunmen dressed as soldiers opened fire on a church in the village during sunday mass killing nine worshipers in an attack in which the militants again burnt several homes
only two weeks ago boko haram insurgents kidnapped at least one hundred and eighty five women and children and killed thirty two people in a raid on another village near chibok called gumsuri local officials said
boko haram has terrorized northern nigeria regularly since two thousand and nine attacking police schools churches and civilians and bombing government buildings
violence has increased sharply in recent months ahead of elections due in february
the islamist group considered one of the world's most deadly terrorist organizations has said its aim is to impose a stricter enforcement of sharia law across nigeria which is split between a majority muslim north and a mostly christian south

the popular twenty one day annapurna circuit takes trekkers in a horseshoe shaped route around a majestic segment of the himalayas in nepal
on the ten th day of the tour chaudhary and his clients two young israeli women were descending from the highest point of the trail thorung la pass to the next destination a walk that would normally take about seven hours
now after more than ten hours of heading downhill the snow pelted
the flurry fell heavier and faster obstructing their vision
there was nowhere to stop or rest
they had to keep walking
you couldn't see the trail there was snow everywhere making it easy to get lost said chaudhary
it was all white in the distance you could only see shadows of people walking
some wandered off the trail
as the blizzard continued their feet sunk into the snow pile
as their steps became heavier they began to cry
as the hours passed chaudhary could make out backpacks and supplies strewn on the snow
there were people who had fallen or were stuck or resting along the way
i couldn't tell if i saw a dead body
conditions in the himalayas can be cruel
but trekkers dying in snowstorms on the annapurna circuit is almost unheard of until this year
nepal known for its fabled himalayas including mount everest has endured a deadly tragic year
in april a hanging glacial mass collapsed and tumbled through a dangerous route on everest killing sixteen sherpas in the worst single disaster
months later an unseasonal snowstorm struck annapurna killing at least forty three people including locals and foreign tourists
were the disasters just prone to happen or was climate change a factor 
everest mountaineers have spoken of changes they've witnessed for years
in my first journey there was snow and ice said apa sherpa a retired mountaineer who made his first summit in one thousand nine hundred and ninety
now we can see more rock
it's more dangerous
the glacier's melting the ice is falling there's rocks falling more
after a record twenty one summits of everest he has no doubt that conditions are changing rapidly
dawa stephen sherpa who has been climbing everest since two thousand and six agreed
our observations show that seracs are peeling off the mountains much quicker and we're seeing avalanches much more frequently and of greater magnitude
whether the deadly disasters in nepal this year can be linked to climate change is debatable
i am leery of attributing everything bad in nature to climate change said jeffrey kargel senior associate research scientist at the university of arizona who studies the himalayas
sorting out what's specifically due to climate change and what's not is a difficult and sometimes impossible task
that said it's clear climate is changing all over the world including in nepal
while it's difficult to blame any single incident on climate change there's evidence of an increasingly warming himalayas
temperatures in the central himalayas increased by about zero point six degrees celsius per decade between one thousand nine hundred and seventy seven and two thousand according to one study
in the tibetan plateau the average temperature in lhasa rose by one point three five degrees celsius in thirty years according to a report by international centre for integrated mountain development
the impact of climate change includes accelerated glacial melt irregular rainfall changes in the monsoon season and greater risk of catastrophes such as avalanches landslides and floods
natural disasters always happen regardless of climate change experts say
what's worrisome is that disasters in the himalayas are becoming more common
extreme flooding hit pakistan in two thousand and twelve and landslides and flooding washed away streets and killed hundreds in two thousand and thirteen at a himalayan holy site in kedernath india
unusually early and heavy monsoon rains triggered that disaster in which two months of rain poured in two days
these extreme rare events they're not rare anymore kargel said
the himalayas stretch from the eastern corner of afghanistan through nepal to the northern tip of myanmar
they contain snow packs and glaciers with freshwater that feed ten major asian rivers including the ganges brahmaputra mekong yellow and yangtze giving life to the continent's farms
disruptions to the himalayas could affect agriculture as well as water and food security for asian countries including the two most populous countries in the world india and china
nepal sits sandwiched between these two countries which are among the world's biggest contributors to greenhouse gas emissions
but nepal emits zero point zero two five percents of the world's greenhouse gas emissions according to estimates
we have not swallowed poison yet we are being poisoned said dr. govind raj pokharel vice chairman of the nepal's planning commission
we haven't done anything against nature or contributed to climate change but we are majorly affected
in nepal climate change is already impacting lives and livelihood scientists say
climate change is making things worse said deepak k.c
senior program officer for integrated climate risk management at the united nations development program
there are lots of dry spurts interspersed with heavy rain in a short period of time that's causing flooding
farmers say that pests they've never seen before are eating their crops
the monsoon rains they've traditionally expected to arrive in june have become inconsistent many say
we depend on timely rainfall for crop cultivation said purnimaya thamang a farmer who lives in a small village near the foot of the himalayas
we may not be able to feed ourselves or have the proper yield
the rain is either too late too little or too much
it wasn't like this before they say
nepal's mountains are encircled with terrace farms where families have tilled the soil for generations
more than seventy percents of nepalis work in agriculture and most are subsistence farmers
many farmers like ganesh thami have seen landslides and floods destroy their livelihoods
he woke up several years ago to his house trembling as a flood swept over his farmland
the river beating the stones made drumming sounds that kept growing
i heard the sound of the boulders rolling with the water
it felt like an earthquake said thami who lost his farm in dolakha near the himalayas
dolakha is identified as one of the most vulnerable districts to landslides according to a national study on climate change conducted by the nepalese government
the farmers say their livelihood is becoming harder and they don't know why
the people that are hit the hardest are not the ones causing the climate change said david molden director general of the kathmandu based international centre for integrated mountain development
that's the important message
the poorest people in the world are emitting the least amount of carbon they're the ones who have to adapt dramatically to these changes
one of the issues is that some villages and homes are cropping up too close to a river or in dangerous areas prone to landslides or floods
people who are building are unaware that they're in dire jeopardy kargel said
right now there's uncontrolled growth in very vulnerable places with houses sitting on river bluffs
the mountains have always carried risk of landslides avalanches and snowstorms even without climate change
but new developments in vulnerable areas exacerbate the risks of making them casualty events
the himalayas are changing the way people are living in the himalayas is changing too said molden
people are living closer to the river there are more trekkers and mountain climbers
as everest has become more commercial the number of expeditions has increased
in two thousand and thirteen six hundred and fifty eight climbers summited the peak compared with one hundred and ninety two two decades ago
about twenty thousand people a year now trek around the annapurnas
more people climbing and trekking means a greater probability of disasters that impact tourists and local hires
it's riskier for local hires like hari chaudhary who are exposed to greater risks because of repeated trips
why would you want to go to the mountains 
i only do it because i need to survive and i need the money he said
the only opportunities for uneducated landless men are to take a construction job in the middle east or work in tourism said chaudhary a lanky man with a wiry frame
he has to support his wife and two kids
during the blizzard he guided his two clients to safety after twelve hours
while dozens died went missing or had their hands blackened from frostbite he and his two israeli hikers survived without injuries
for a day's work of carrying fifty pounds of gear and guiding tourists he earns ten dollar
the annapurna snowstorm was the effect of cyclone hudhud which lashed india and wound up north in nepal in october
hundreds of tourists and local hires were stranded when the storms hit
people were not prepared they didn't get the warning signals like they should have said molden
while the annapurna event can not be definitively ruled as a climate change related disaster it can't be ruled out either scientists say
the speculation to the link to climate change is we're getting more intense rainfall or precipitation said molden
it's so hard to say that event was due to climate change
all of these things have a relation
to prove that would be difficult
chaudhary attributes his survival to the rings of ice that formed around his ankles which blocked snow from seeping into his bright orange nikes saving his feet from frostbite
just three days later chaudhary laced the same sneakers and headed back to the mountains to guide another group glancing upward to the clouds that for him and others were becoming increasingly difficult to decipher


some may call it serendipity others divine intervention
either way circumstances prevented two families from boarding doomed airasia flight qz eight thousand five hundred and one
in one case it was missed emails
in another an illness in the family
as a result fifteen people seven of them children are alive and well
it was no stroke of luck but an act of god that her father caught hepatitis said inge goreti ferdiningsih because it made her family cancel their tickets on the airasia flight a day before it took off
we are extremely grateful and god is really great she said
i believe that god is saving and protecting us and this is truly a miracle
inge goreti booked the family vacation nine months earlier
her father wasn't booked on the trip and her younger sister was staying by his side
so inge goreti could still have gone with her husband and three children
the bags stood packed and ready and the family was full of anticipation for the singapore vacation
christopher ten nadine seven and felix five were psyched about taking a local ship cruise splashing at a water park and watching animals perform at sea world
but then inge goreti's sister called from a hospital where she had taken their father after he complained of stomach pains
the diagnosis
hepatitis
the news tugged at her
i had this feeling in my heart that i wanted to be with my dad inge goreti said
so she called off the trip saturday a day before the flight
christopher had a hard time accepting it
he was so looking forward to the trip and became very upset she said
an aversion to phone messages may have spared another family
christianawati was going to ring in the new year in singapore with her family and her brother's family she told a french news agency
ten were traveling in all
but her brother forgot to check messages from airasia telling them that the flight was leaving two hours before the original departure time
they emailed and called us on december fifteen and sixteen to inform us but we missed those calls christianawati who goes by one name told agence france presse
so we arrived at the airport to check in for the seven thirty a.m. flight but were told our flights had been rescheduled to five thirty a.m. and we were late
of course we were angry she said
some family members pulled up in their car just in time to see the last passengers whisk past them into the boarding lounge the sydney morning herald reported
but christianawati's family was traveling in two cars and one was lagging behind
they just missed the flight
then they heard the news
maybe it is all god's plan that my family and i were not on the flight christianawati said
it was a blessing in disguise
early sunday at inge goreti's home the phone rang a few times
we received calls from relatives regarding the plane that lost contact inge goreti said
we all broke down and cried
sunday evening the family went to church to give thanks
but mixed with inge goreti's tears of relief have been tears of sadness
she recognized names on flight qz eight thousand five hundred and one's passenger manifest she said
friends and colleagues were on board

rainer's death was first reported by her daughter francesca knittel bowyer on twitter
mummy had the fragility of an orchid the energy of a hummingbird the tenacity of a hunter
she could change calm waters into a raging storm with a look and the lift of a finger bowyer told cnn in an email
my heart is a hole without her but that hole will definitely be filled with incredible memories sweet salty and funny
i want her memory to linger with those who knew her and be given to those who did not
rainer who was born in dusseldorf germany in one thousand nine hundred and ten was a well known european actress when she was brought to america by mgm in one thousand nine hundred and thirty five in the belief she could be the next greta garbo
she immediately came through on their investment with her star turn in one thousand nine hundred and thirty six's the great ziegfeld winning a best actress oscar
she repeated the achievement with one thousand nine hundred and thirty seven's the good earth based on pearl s. buck's novel in which she played o lan the wife of protagonist wang lung
with that prize she became the first actress to win consecutive best actress academy awards a feat not equaled until katharine hepburn pulled off the trick for one thousand nine hundred and sixty seven's guess who's coming to dinner and one thousand nine hundred and sixty eight's the lion in winter
to date they are the only actresses to have done so
both spencer tracy and tom hanks have done so in the best actor category and jason robards won two straight supporting actor oscars
but unlike hepburn who enjoyed a long career in movies despite the vagaries of fame rainer's life as a hollywood star was short lived by her own choice
she had frequent battles with mgm boss louis b. mayer and didn't like the roles she was offered
all kinds of nonsense she told the uk's telegraph news site in two thousand and nine
i didn't want to do it and i walked out
mayer said that girl is a frankenstein she's going to ruin our whole firm 
he said we made you and we are going to destroy you 
instead rainer turned the tables and left mgm
her marriage to playwright clifford odets had fallen apart and she returned to europe
she married robert knittel a publisher in one thousand nine hundred and forty five
the two were married for more than forty years until his death in one thousand nine hundred and eighty nine
she made a film for paramount hostages in one thousand nine hundred and forty three but that was it until one thousand nine hundred and ninety seven when she appeared in a british production of doestoyevsky's the gambler
she had other opportunities federico fellini asked her to appear in one thousand nine hundred and sixty's la dolce vita but she had a falling out with the italian director before filming though she didn't lament leaving movies
her life was quite full with famous friends arturo toscanini and thomas mann among them and plenty of activity including a few plays and tv roles
she wasn't easily impressed by hollywood or fame
asked about the nobel prize winning russian author alexander solzhenitsyn who stayed with her and knittel in london once she told the telegraph that he was terrible
you could not talk to him about anything except his own work you know 
he was so conceited and demanding
she said
despite her long life she told the telegraph that she felt that there was so much more she wished to know
i know nothing
nothing
she said
my god one's lifespan is so very short
at the time she was just shy of one hundred
rainer is survived by her daughter two granddaughters and two great grandchildren

in a mesmerizing interview in the new smithsonian magazine the civil rights historian taylor branch describes the three freedom riders who were killed in mississippi fifty summers ago
all three had understood the dangers of going into the deep south to register black voters
all had been trained in the practice of radical nonviolence
one of them michael schwerner lived out that ethic as he faced the gun wielding klansman who was about to murder him
schwerner said to the man calmly sir i know just how you feel
then the man shot him and his two friends
think about that
put yourself in schwerner's shoes
imagine what it would have taken to summon such stillness such profound and sincere compassion for one's killer at the moment of death
and then put yourself in the shoes of that klansman
after all we know this story only because the klansman later told it to investigators
he was haunted for the rest of his life by the depth of empathy that he confronted in that fateful instant
this story has stayed with me too challenging me to admit it when in my comfortable everyday existence i fail to demonstrate even a fraction of that empathy and self realization
but it's stayed with me in my civic identity as well
and it's made me wonder how much of our political and civic strife could be alleviated if we learned something from a young man who's been dead a half century but never gave in to fear or hate
look around our country today
look at the new york policemen who feel so insulted that they think they must turn their backs on their mayor
look at the african american citizens of that city who feel that the nypd has never shown them the respect those disgruntled officers now demand
look at the online comment threads after ferguson and staten island
look at how black men in hoodies and white men with badges are demonized
look at the escalation of outrage that leads to philosophical hashtag wars about whether blacklivesmatter or alllivesmatter
look at the disgust that drips from the lips of democrats as they brace for a reactionary gop congress and from republicans as they decry imperious democrats
errol louis
there are two sides to america's policing issues
look now at the people in your own community
look at the way we walk past people whose circumstances are radically different from our own
perhaps they are richer or poorer than you or more liberal or less or more self destructive or less
look at the way we ascribe moral meaning to those differences
look at the way we tell ourselves stories about what our selves are
look at the way those stories always accuse others of faults and excuse us for our own
look at the way those solipsistic habits which start with those closest to us radiate outward
i have been guilty of this kind of self justification both personal and political
so have you
and for all of us this season is an occasion to ask what it would take to earn the right to say these words
i know just how you feel
to some people this kind of radical compassion and loving nonviolence seems dangerously squishy a slide down the slope to moral relativism
they fear that understanding the heart of another person particularly the enemy will lead to an obliteration of distinctions between self and other between right and wrong
but that's not how it was for michael schwerner and for the other freedom riders
they had a crystal clear understanding of the moral differences between them and the last stand defenders of jim crow between good and evil
their capacity for empathy empowered them not to subdue others but to invite them into goodness and thereby transform them
this power does not come easily
it takes a lot to say truly in the heat of conflict that you know how your adversary feels
and to say nothing more no letting him off the hook no further demonstrations of your goodness
frankly few of us will ever attain the near saintly disciplined open heartedness of young schwerner
but more of us can come closer
and when few of us even bother trying we get the political culture of today
polarization for its own sake
politics as a game of annihilation rather than repeat play
citizens as bloodthirsty spectators
as we begin the new year as conflicts over race and class and guns and belonging continue to rage across the land let's resolve to learn just how someone feels
and to let that knowledge guide our lives as citizens

the u.n. security council in a close eight two vote with five abstentions on tuesday voted down a palestinian statehood resolution that set a deadline for the withdrawal of israeli forces from palestinian territories by two thousand and seventeen
eight nations voted for the draft resolution one vote short of the necessary nine to be adopted including jordan which sponsored the resolution and three permanent security council members
china russia and france
the united states voted against the resolution on the table and had been expected to exercise its permanent council member authority and veto the measure had it passed
the security council consists of fifteen members five permanent and ten rotating members
the permanent five china france russia united kingdom and the united states have veto power to block any resolution
the resolution called for an end of israeli troops in palestinian territories including the west bank by two thousand and seventeen and set a twelve month deadline for a peace solution with two separate states
it also identified east jerusalem as the capital of what would be called palestine
palestine currently is not recognized as a state
in november two thousand and twelve the general assembly voted to upgrade the status of the palestinians to non member observer state
dina kawar jordan's ambassador to the united nations and the sponsor of the draft said she hoped the security council would have adopted the resolution because the council bears both the legal and the moral responsibilities to resolve the israeli palestinian conflict which is the crux of the conflict in the middle east
elements in the draft resolution including the right for palestinian people for self determination a two state solution with east jerusalem as the capital of palestine and an end to what it calls israeli occupation were acceptable not only to members of the security council but to the international community as a whole kawar said
u.s
ambassador samantha power said no other country in the world has invested more than the united states in pursuing peace between israel and the palestinians but said the resolution would undermine efforts to get back to an atmosphere that makes it possible to achieve two states for two people
power said that the current resolution was deeply unbalanced and instead of giving a voice to both sides only considered the concerns of one
today's vote should not be interpreted as a victory for an unsustainable status quo instead it should serve as a wake up call to catalyze all interested parties to take constructive responsible steps to achieve a two state solution power said
australia also voted against the measure
the palestinian representative at the united nations riyad mansour told the diplomats that it is most regrettable that the security council remains paralyzed
the repeated requests for us to wait and wait and wait while our people are suffering while our people are besieged while our land is being colonized and while the two state solution is being destroyed and the prospects for peace are evaporating must understand that such requests are not viable under these circumstances and are unsustainable he said
the palestinians have found every possible opportunity to avoid direct negotiations with israel said israel nitzan a counselor representing israel at the meeting and called the most recent unilateral draft the latest endeavor in a never ending string of political games
i have news for the palestinians
you can not agitate and provoke your way to a state nitzan said
five countries abstained from the vote including permanent member united kingdom
uk ambassador mark lyall grant told the security council we consider president abbas a man of peace and understand the pressure that the palestinian leadership has been under to act and their frustration at the lack of progress
but we are disappointed that the normal and necessary negotiation did not take place on this occasion
after the meeting jordan's kawar told reporters that although she would have liked more consultations and negotiations to come up with a product that would be acceptable to the fifteen member states the importance of this resolution was to put some momentum and dynamics in the security council

heather cho the forty year old daughter of korean air's chairman is in the south seoul detention facility the seoul western district prosecutor's office said
officials gave no other details other than the investigation into the incident is ongoing
a spokesman for the office lee kwang woo said an arrest warrant was approved because the necessity was recognized because of the graveness of the case and there was an attempt to systematically cover up the charges since the beginning of the incident
cho resigned from her post as a vice president at the company in the aftermath of the incident earlier this month on a flight from new york's jfk airport to south korea's incheon international airport
she ordered that the plane turn back to the gate and that a flight attendant be removed because she was served nuts in a bag instead of on a plate in first class
although her role put her in charge of in flight service cho was a passenger and was not flying in an official capacity
amid public anger over her behavior she and her father both apologized for the incident
cho whose korean name is cho hyun ah said she accepted full responsibility for what happened
last week prosecutors said an arrest warrant might cover charges of violating aviation safety rules including a change in a flight plan assault on a plane coercion and interference in the execution of duty
the warrant was approved tuesday night
when contacted by cnn the press office for korean air said it had no comment on the latest development
testimony from crew members and passengers confirmed that cho used violent language in a loud voice which may not be compliant with an aviation safety law that requires cooperation of passengers on a flight the ministry of land infrastructure and transport said earlier this month
the captain of the plane has also faced criticism for obeying cho's demands to turn back the plane and remove the flight attendant
the airline faces possible disciplinary action from the government because of the captain's failure to command and supervise crew members to ensure the safe operation of the flight the ministry said last week

the country was midway through the turmoil of mao zedong's cultural revolution
universities and schools were just re opening and students brandishing little red books toiled in factories or on farms
florcruz then a firebrand student leader from the philippines on a study tour found himself stuck in china after his name was placed on a blacklist by then philippines president ferdinand marcos
fearing arrest as martial law was declared in his home country in september one thousand nine hundred and seventy two he stayed on along with four others from the study tour
a year later his passport expired leaving him temporarily stateless
the idea was to come for three weeks and see what was going on he says
i'm an accidental tourist
he ended up staying for more than four decades and launching a career as a journalist just as china began opening up to the world
on his day of retirement from cnn he reflects on his ring side ticket to china's rise
what was life like under mao 
when it became clear we were staying in china we wanted to study but universities weren't ready to enroll foreign students so we asked to work
our hosts didn't make us but we insisted
i worked on a state farm in hunan province
initially i found it a romantic idea but it didn't take long for the romance to wear off
at the end of the day we carved out two hours to learn chinese
our interpreter was our teacher and by the end of those few months on the farm i could converse in chinese
from late one thousand nine hundred and seventy two i worked on a fishing boat for two years
we'd go out on the high seas for five or six days at a time on two trawler ships pulling a huge net
it was a spartan life very simple
it was sometimes bleak but often also exciting because of the political campaigns that were going on
we would only watch from the sidelines see posters and in private discussions with chinese friends
we were told not to get involved
tell us about some of your memories of university and your circle of classmates
i was in the class of one thousand nine hundred and seventy seven the first class when college students were enrolled through a nationwide entrance examination
among my cohorts was current premier li keqiang
he studied law
also among them was bo xilai once one of the most powerful politicians in china now disgraced and sentenced to life in prison for corruption and abuse of power
he was in my world history class
we would stand in the cafeteria holding our bowls of food there were no chairs to sit on and he dared to come close to foreign students like me
he knew enough english to chat with me and even then was quite charismatic and opinionated
a lot of that batch of fellow students are now in important roles in the government bureaucracy
some are top professors scientists and entrepreneurs
i've kept friends with many of them
they've been good sounding boards
read
the good the bad and the exiled 
china's class of one thousand nine hundred and seventy seven
you've witnessed the trial of the gang of four the tiananmen massacre and the olympics
what else stands out 
i covered wham's concert the first western pop group to perform in china
it was attended by thousands of beijing residents most of whom just looked perplexed
police looked on sternly if anyone stood up to cheer and dance
i remember when coca cola went on sale for the first time people thought it tasted like a chinese medicine concoction
later on it was a big treat to interview yao ming when he chosen as the number one nba draft
i'm a huge basketball fan and yao turned out to be a humble and affable guy although i got a sore neck
when i was at time my big scoop was breaking the news of jiang qing's suicide several days before it was reported by xinhua
but to be honest scoops like that were rare and perhaps less important than providing accurate and fair reports and analysis day after day week after week

reflections from the tiananmen protests twenty five years on
you're the longest serving foreign correspondent in china
how has covering the country changed 
it's easier than it used to be in the one thousand nine hundred and eighty s
there was a then ten day rule that required us to give notice if we wanted to leave beijing
technically except for tibet we can now go anywhere as long as someone invited us
in recent years though there have been signs of tightening
many colleagues including our own crew have had brushes with authorities the hand in front of the camera
cnn comes under heavy scrutiny because it's so closely associated with the united states and we have been accused of biased reporting on china
i've had to explain to officials here that we're not an extension of u.s. government
we are independent
we report it as we see it
china is a much wealthier place than when you first arrived
have all the changes you've seen since the one thousand nine hundred and seventy s been for the better 
i echo what my chinese friends would say
they enjoy much more personal freedom the freedom to travel to choose where to live to marry whoever they wish to take a job or quit a job
freedom of speech and expression has it limits but most people know where the red line lies
of course there are problems
many are the unintended consequences of the reform that started thirty years ago like environmental pollution and degradation and the lack of a spiritual anchor for most chinese
i see a nation of one point three billion seemingly rudderless looking for direction and meaning in their lives even those who are rich
it's not a big secret
i think the government acknowledges this crisis of faith
you've lived in china for forty years and raised a family here
how do you feel about it 
i've lived here forty three years i've seen where it came from
i appreciate all the quotidian changes
i tend to look at china as a glass half full rather than half empty because i've seen it virtually empty
it was my refuge and later my training and battle ground as journalist
i feel bittersweet to be ending my time here as a foreign correspondent
it's been a rewarding experience and not really the end
i'll still be involved in china watching in china or wherever my next projects and adventures take me
in the next few months my wife ana and i will stay on in beijing where she is gainfully employed
for a change i will be the trailing spouse but later i hope to do a bit of writing and speechifying
should you leave china what will you miss about it 
china's been my second home although it will never replace the philippines as my homeland
i'll definitely not miss the beijing smog but will certainly miss the quaint old neighborhood nearby including the men who belt out visceral shouts early in the morning their way of exercise my wake up call
i'll miss the guttural accent of the beijing taxi drivers and their unsolicited opinions
i'll miss the food jianbing zhajiangmian peking duck and yes my periodic foot massage
of course i'll miss my friends who've accepted me as a virtual beijing ren
what's your advice for journalists in china 
the best stories are often of ordinary people doing extraordinary deeds
keep up the good fight for fair honest and nuanced reporting
china has changed dramatically
i feel fortunate to have been in the right place at the right time to have witnessed these changes up close
for better or worse china now is a major player in the world
i never imagined china could be so prosperous powerful and proud
whatever china does or does not do has impact on global affairs and our lives
for our sake and china's too i hope china will emerge as a peace loving global power

bianchi who suffered a head injury while driving for the now defunct marussia team skidded off the track in wet conditions and collided with a recovery vehicle
the frenchman sustained a diffuse axonal injury which causes widespread tearing of nerve fibers across the whole of the brain according to uk brain charity headway
he returned to france last month and was treated at the intensive care unit of le centre hospitalier universitaire de nice before moving on to the rehabilitation center
as we reach the conclusion of a difficult year for our family we wanted to take this opportunity to provide a further update regarding jules medical situation per our pledge to communicate continued information when appropriate to his many fans said the driver's parents philippe and christine in a statement
it was a significant and very comforting step for us to be able to bring jules home to france last month to continue his rehabilitation surrounded by his family and friends
this is very important for jules and also for us
jules neurological status remains unchanged
he is unconscious but able to breathe unaided
whilst there is no significant information to report we take a great deal of comfort from the fact that jules continues to fight as we knew he would and this has enabled the medical professionals caring for him to commence the planned but very painstaking program of rehabilitation therapy
bianchi's parents say they will continue to provide updates of their son's progress and thanked the public for their ongoing support
the statement added
as we reflect on the events of the past few months we would like to acknowledge once again the overwhelming warmth and affection shown towards our son
these continue to be challenging times for our family but the knowledge that he has touched the lives of so many people all around the world has helped us through
earlier this month the fia published a report which stated that bianchi did not slow sufficiently to avoid losing control during his crash at the suzuka circuit
bianchi's marussia team folded in november after administrators failed to find fresh investment
in the days after the crash marussia moved to address accusations that bianchi had not reduced his speed and that the team had actively encouraged him not to do so
the marussia f one team is shocked and angered by these allegations said the statement issued in october
at a time when its driver is critically ill in hospital and the team has made clear that its highest priority is consideration for jules and his family it is distressed to have to respond to deeply upsetting rumors and inaccuracies in respect of the circumstances of jules accident
regarding point one jules did slow down under the double waved yellow flags
that is an irrefutable fact as proven by the telemetry data which the team has provided to the fia
regarding point two an audio copy of the full radio transmission between jules and the team and a written transcript were provided to the fia
it is quite clear from the transmission and the transcript that at no point during the period leading up to jules accident did the team urge jules to drive faster or make any comments suggesting that he should do so
the update on the french driver's condition comes a day after the first anniversary of michael schumacher's skiing accident
the seven time world champion is continuing his recovery from the severe head injuries sustained in a crash at the french ski resort of meribel on twenty nine th december last year
schumacher spent nine months in hospital in france following emergency brain surgery but was moved to the family home near lake geneva in switzerland in september to continue his rehabilitation
while the german's family declined to give an update on his condition formula one drivers and fans expressed their continuing support for the stricken driver on social media

the islamic state in iraq and syria has just published in its latest english language magazine dabiq what it claims is an interview with the jordanian pilot captured in syria
militants say they downed an f sixteen jet manned by moaz al kassasbeh as he took part in u.s. led coalition air strikes near isis's de facto capital raqqah last week
images provided by the extremist organization's media wing and circulated widely on social media showed bearded men with kalashnikovs pulling the terrified airman out of a nearby river
we entered the region of raqqah to sweep the area then the striker jets entered to begin their attack al kassasbeh said according to the online publication
my plane was struck by a heat seeking missile
i heard and felt its hit
the jordanian government and u.s. central command described the incident as an aircraft crash and adamantly stated that it was not shot down by isis
i checked the system display and it indicated that the engine was damaged and burning the pilot is quoted as saying
the plane began to deviate from its normal flight path so i ejected
i landed in the furat river by parachute and the seat caught on some ground keeping me fixed until i was captured by soldiers of the islamic state
a still image of al kassasbeh wearing the orange jumpsuit tops the short article titled
the capture of the crusader pilot
journalist james foley american ngo founder peter kassig and british aid worker alan henning among other hostages wore similar outfits in videos purporting to show their murders at the hands of the extremists
the magazine also contains an article claimed to have been authored by british hostage john cantlie headlined meltdown
the article suggests the world is facing economic collapse and says it makes enormous sense for the islamic state to mint their own gold dinars
cantlie was a photojournalist and freelance writer for major british newspapers before he was kidnapped in november two thousand and twelve along with american journalist james foley who was also killed by isis militants
the family of the captured jordanian pilot have made several emotional pleas for his release and called on the jordanian government to launch an investigation into the crash
be supportive of our brother moaz and to be merciful on him please send him back to us jawad al kassasbeh told cnn arabic last friday
he is just a soldier who is following orders and has no authority
jordan is one of several nations participating in an american led mission against isis an organization which is seeking to establish a caliphate or islamic state and has wrested territory spanning from central syria to about one hundred km north of baghdad
the united nations says the group's acts of brutality including the enslavement of women mass killing and the torture and imprisonment of its enemies amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity

in two thousand and twelve i was diagnosed with stage three c ovarian cancer at age fifty two
as i watched dr. sanjay gupta interview doctors researchers and two patients at yale new haven medical center smilow cancer center i decided then and there that i wanted to be in a research trial
some days in our lives are memorable
we all prefer the good days marriages births and graduations
june eight two thousand and twelve was not one of those days for me
that was the day i was diagnosed
i went immediately from being a lawyer mother and wife taking care of everyone to being a professional patient
read
why measles won't take down the maasai
before diagnosis i did not know approximately twenty one thousand women are diagnosed with ovarian cancer annually in the united states and fourteen thousand five hundred women die from this disease
that's forty per day and one thousand two hundred per month
i am positive for the brca genetic mutation inherited via my father who carried the mutation in his genes
women like me with this mutation have a fifty percents chance of getting ovarian cancer in their lifetime
while women with breast cancer have a ninety percents five year survival rate women with ovarian cancer have a forty five percents five year survival rate
as there is no test to find it at an early stage when it is most treatable it's most often found in the late stage when it is difficult to treat and life expectancy is at its lowest two point five years on average but i am now exceeding that average
i had seen my gynecologist eight weeks before diagnosis and had a pap smear and a pelvic exam which were clear
over the next few weeks i began to experience bloating decreased appetite back pain and frequent urination
i had all the classic symptoms but was not seeing what they were signs of ovarian cancer
i hadn't paid attention because i was busy running my practice and my home
busy with life
suddenly june six i could not urinate properly
my gp examined me and scheduled a ct scan the following day
then on june eight came the tornado named cancer
read
how deep brain stimulation could unlock secrets of tourette's 
surgery was june eleven
after nine days collapsed veins from ivs and losing over twenty pounds of ascities a fluid produced by the cancer i was released from the hospital and allowed a few weeks to heal
the pathology report showed i had low grade epithelial cancer which is notoriously difficult to treat
i have a less than thirty five percents chance of living through the next five years
unfortunately there has been no breakthrough drug for ovarian cancer treatment in more than twenty years
my treatment began with chemotherapy three weeks on one week off
the drugs carboplatin and taxol were infused into my body
i spent the weeks off trying to clear my chemo brain and raise my blood levels
i went through six of these cycles spanning july to december two thousand and twelve
the treatment appeared to be effective but by may two thousand and thirteen i was back on chemo
after sixteen cycles in august two thousand and fourteen this too had stopped working
i was faced with the difficult decision of whether to try treatment that would further deplete me or enter a clinical trial
i knew i needed a new approach to my treatment and then the night came when i saw the show
the next day i called yale and learned a new ovarian cancer trial was about to start for which i might be eligible
they were seeking five patients and my timing appeared to be perfect
within four weeks i had cleared all the testing and began the trial
my form of cancer made me eligible as it releases certain proteins which attract the experimental drug enabling it to attack in a targeted manner
i describe this as tactical airstrike treatment as opposed to most treatments which carpet bomb and kill healthy cells in our bodies as well as cancer cells
my treatments are weekly via iv for one hour
since it is a trial i also regularly undergo comprehensive diagnostic tests and the chemo nurses check my vital signs to ensure that this drug is helping rather than harming me
after six treatments the cancer is stable and has not grown
thus i am allowed to continue treatment for another six weeks and undergo another evaluation
i know i am one of the fortunate women with a lot of support
my husband has been with me every step every day and participates in my care and the fabulous doctors and nurses have cared for me from the beginning to now
as i say regularly i am not in the mood to die yet
so one day at a time i will keep trying until we find something that will work even temporarily
perhaps this trial will keep me alive long enough for science to catch up and help find a cure for this and other cancers

imagine you're the kind of person who worries about a future when robots become smart enough to threaten the very existence of the human race
for years you've been dismissed as a crackpot consigned to the same category of people who see elvis lurking in their waffles
in two thousand and fourteen you found yourself in good company
this year arguably the world's greatest living scientific mind stephen hawking and its leading techno industrialist elon musk voiced their fears about the potentially lethal rise of artificial intelligence
they were joined by philosophers physicists and computer scientists all of whom spoke out about the serious risks posed by the development of greater than human machine intelligence
in a widely cited op ed co written with mit physicist max tegmark nobel laureate frank wilczek and computer scientist stuart russell hawking sounded the ai alarm
one can imagine outsmarting financial markets out inventing human researchers out manipulating human leaders and developing weapons we can not even understand
whereas the short term impact of ai depends on who controls it the long term impact depends on whether it can be controlled at all
musk was reportedly more emphatic expanding on his tweeted warnings by calling ai humanity's biggest existential risk and likening it to summoning the demon
the debate over ai was given a big boost this year by the publication of philosopher nick bostrom's superintelligence
paths dangers strategies which makes a close study of just why and how ai may be so catastrophically dangerous
bostrom is the director of the future of humanity institute at oxford one of several new institutions devoted to studying existential threats to the human race of which ai figures centrally
in may the massachusetts institute of technology christened its own future of life institute
in the academic community at least ai anxiety is booming
they're right to be worried
the first and most immediate issue is the potential for ai to put large numbers of humans out of work
a study by carl frey and michael osborne of oxford's program on the impacts of future technology put the matter starkly
in their analysis of over seven hundred jobs almost half could be done by a computer in the future
this wave of computerization could destroy not simply low wage low skill jobs but some white collar and service sector jobs previously thought to be immune as well
technology is marching on both our manual and mental labor
as serious a threat as widespread job loss is we've seen this movie before
during past technological upheavals humans have cleverly created jobs and industries from the ashes of obsolete ones
we may be able to keep our collective heads above water even if ai encroaches on more creative and intellectual industries
what we should be more concerned about is humanity losing its perch as the earth's foremost intelligence
for those anxious about ai current efforts to develop self correcting algorithms coupled with the relentless growth in computer power and the increasing ubiquity of sensors collecting all manner of intelligence and information around the world will push ai to human and ultimately superhuman intelligence
it's an event that's been dubbed the intelligence explosion a term invoked in one thousand nine hundred and sixty five by computer scientist irving john good in a paper outlining the development path for artificial intelligence
what makes an intelligence explosion so worrisome is that intelligence is not a tool or a technology
we may think of ai as something that we use like a hammer or corkscrew but that's fundamentally the wrong way to think about it
sufficiently advanced intelligence like ours is a creative force
the more powerful it is the more it can reshape the world around it
artificial intelligence does not need to be malevolent to be catastrophically dangerous to humanity
when computer scientists talk about the possible threat to humanity from superintelligent ai they don't mean the terminator or matrix
instead it's typically a more prosaic end
humanity wiped out because an ai tasked with a simple goal requisitions all the energy and raw materials on earth to relentlessly churn out paper clips outsmarting and out maneuvering all human attempts to stop it
in hollywood's telling there are always humans left to fight back but such an outcome is implausible if humanity is faced with a truly superior intelligence
it would be like mice attempting to outwit a human
in that event ai researchers like keefe roedersheimer see a less inspiring finale
all the people are dead
needless to say not everyone shares this bleak forecast
in the ai optimist camp futurist and google director of engineering ray kurzweil also sees intelligent machines precipitating human extinction of a sort only in kurzweil's telling humanity is not exterminated but subsumed into a superintelligent machine
kurzweil's human machine symbiosis is not a techno catastrophe but the ultimate liberation from humanity's biological frailties
others are skeptical that ai will ever reach human levels of intelligence and cognition let alone surpass it
some like new york university's gary marcus are on the fence
i don't know of any proof that we should be worried marcus told me this year but nor of any proof that we should not be worried
irving john good famously described the development of an ultraintelligent machine as the last invention that man need ever make for after that humanity would cede innovation and technological development to its smarter progeny
even if it's not a straight line from siri to extinction we humans should probably be watching our machines just a bit more closely

gone are the days of the grainy camera phone images with the resolution of a poor imitation monet
today's smartphone cameras are so advanced that mobile photography is becoming an art form in its own right turning photo sharing apps like instagram into portable galleries for amateur photographers and professionals like street style photographer tommy ton and chief official white house photographer pete souza
you have the dark room in your pocket says pierre le govic the paris based founder of out of the phone the world's first publishing house dedicated to mobile photography
this month out of the phone follows its debut publication last year's book of mobile photos from two time pulitzer prize nominated photographer richard koci hernandez with out of the phone
the mobile photo book two thousand and fourteen a diverse selection of one hundred instagram images taken by users from twenty five countries
before founding out of the phone in two thousand and thirteen le govic ran a fine art photography printing company that counted daido moriyama and william eggleston as clients
he first started following mobile photography on instagram in two thousand and eleven and was surprised and impressed by the quality of work that hobbyists were creating
now there are many well known photographers who use the platform but at the very beginning there were many people who didn't know so much about photography and these were the kind of people that i wanted to showcase he says
but on the other hand it was also something confusing because there are too many images
the desire to curate what he was seeing coupled with a longtime ambition to create books led him to give publishing a try
while le govic had preselected a number of established photographers to feature in this year's inaugural anthology he also gave instagram users the chance to put themselves up for consideration using the hashtag outofthephone to nominate their best works
he was astounded to receive over twenty thousand submissions
what was he looking for in a successful entry 
technical skill was understandably important but le govic says he also sought something less tangible
at the end what is important is the story and the sensibility of the photographer
it's a mix between a good story a good composition he says
photography for me is a sort of fresh air a way to look at things differently
so i'm looking for that sort of feeling when i look at pictures
now that the mobile photo book has been published le govic is looking forward to promoting his concept and expanding
he's looking to start hiring in the new year and solicit investors and partners
several projects are set for release next year including books from award winning documentary photographer benjamin lowy and other photographers he believes are using the medium to its fullest

a woman in the northwest highlands of scotland who'd fallen ill tested negative for ebola the scottish government said tuesday
a spokesman for the government said the woman had been in west africa recently though she had no direct contact with anyone with ebola
a patient at aberdeen royal infirmary has tested negative for ebola the press release said
the individual was transferred to the hospital by the scottish ambulance service yesterday after falling ill while visiting torridon in the scottish highlands
meanwhile a health care worker who was diagnosed with the ebola virus after returning to scotland from sierra leone was transferred to the royal free hospital in london
the patient is pauline cafferkey thirty nine of glasgow scotland the hospital said
she was working with save the children at an ebola treatment center said michael von bertele humanitarian director at that organization
she traveled via casablanca morocco and london heathrow airport before arriving at glasgow airport on a british airways flight late sunday the health agency nhs scotland said
after feeling unwell she sought medical attention and became the first person to be diagnosed with ebola within the united kingdom
british media outlets said cafferkey is a public health nurse in scotland's south lanarkshire area who was part of a thirty strong team of medical volunteers deployed to west africa by the uk government last month in a joint endeavor with save the children
she was reportedly transferred to london in a military aircraft fitted with an isolation pod
the royal free hospital is equipped with a high level isolation unit with access restricted to specially trained medical staff
a specially designed tent with controlled ventilation is set up over the patient's bed
a british volunteer nurse william pooley was successfully treated in the unit after he was brought home from sierra leone in august having been diagnosed with ebola there
uk authorities are working to trace those who have come into contact with cafferkey
the scottish government has set up a special number for people to call if they traveled on the same london heathrow to glasgow flight as cafferkey
british airways said it was working closely with health authorities in england and scotland and would help with any information needed
the safety and security of our customers and crew is always our top priority and the risk to people on board that individual flight is extremely low the airline said
ebola patients become infectious only after they display symptoms such as fever and vomiting
the deadly virus is spread through contact with bodily fluids
a downing street spokesman told cnn that british prime minister david cameron and scottish first minister nicola sturgeon had discussed the procedures in place to handle such a case
they agreed that both governments would remain in close touch and ensure everything possible was done to support the patient and although the risk to the general population remained low all measures would be taken to protect public health
another suspected ebola case is being tested in southwest england at the royal cornwall hospital health officials said
we do not expect the results to be known for at least twenty four hours and in the meantime the patient is being looked after in isolation following nationally agreed guidelines and protocols to protect the health of our staff and other patients said a joint statement from the hospital and public health england a government agency
according to uk government guidelines humanitarian workers returning from ebola affected countries in west africa who've been at high risk of exposure are expected to monitor their own health for twenty one days after they get home
as of december twenty four at least seven thousand six hundred and ninety three people had died in the current ebola outbreak centered in liberia sierra leone and guinea the world health organization said
there have been at least nineteen thousand six hundred and ninety five cases

he didn't try to hide what he was doing
he tweeted a picture of himself on the moscow metro as he headed to the demonstration
under house arrest yes but today i very much want to be with you
that is why i am also going said the caption on the photo
news agency interfax reported that navalny was detained by police and was returned to his home instead of being taken to jail
he was on house arrest for a conviction in a two thousand and nine case
earlier navalny was in court where he got a three and a half year suspended sentence for the fraud conviction while his brother oleg also convicted of fraud was given a prison term of the same length
both were hit with steep fines but only oleg navalny was ordered to pay
when the sentence was read alexey navalny shouted out in anger and frustration with the judgment against his brother
the brothers denied charges of embezzling thirty million rubles from a russian subsidiary of french cosmetics company yves rocher between two thousand and eight and two thousand and twelve
there were strong feelings among some in moscow that the brothers should not have been sentenced as they were
despite the biting winter cold their supporters gathered near the kremlin in moscow's manezhnaya square tuesday night to rally against the verdicts
a facebook page promoting the event predicted that thousands would attend but the numbers were far smaller as the protest got underway
the sentencing hearing was originally scheduled for january fifteen when a big rally was planned but was brought forward at a day's notice leading navalny's supporters to slam what they said was an attempt to suppress protest
many people have left moscow ahead of the new year public holiday making it harder to muster a crowd
the protest is likely considered illegal because navalny's supporters didn't have enough time to apply for the permissions required under russian law raising the prospect of a confrontation between protesters and police
after the sentencing navalny supporters also accused the kremlin of using oleg navalny as leverage against his brother
however they did voice surprise that the sentences were not tougher
prosecutors had asked for alexey navalny to be given a ten year prison sentence and oleg to receive an eight year term
a corruption fighting lawyer alexey navalny famously branded the ruling united russia party founded by president vladimir putin the party of crooks and thieves
he was a prominent organizer of mass street protests three years ago and has attacked corruption in russian government using his blog and social media
before tuesday's ruling he was under house arrest after he was convicted last year of misappropriating five hundred thousand dollar worth of state owned timber in what he told cnn was a fabricated case


a fire sparked by a short circuit at a shop quickly engulfed a three story shopping center in the eastern pakistani city of lahore on monday killing at least thirteen people
the fire broke out at the anarkali bazaar
the building which mostly houses shops that sells watches and clocks had no firefighting equipment and no emergency exits said fire official jam sajjad
people inside were forced to flee through a single door and most of the victims suffocated to death said police official asad sarfraz

indonesian searchers battled bad weather wednesday in their efforts to find more remains from airasia flight qz eight thousand five hundred and one a day after the first signs of debris were spotted
there was conflicting information about whether any parts of the plane had been located underwater
one search official told cnn that he believes sonar equipment has detected wreckage from the plane at the bottom of the sea
i think that that's the case said muhammad hernanto the head of search and rescue for the city of surabaya where flight eight thousand five hundred and one began its journey on sunday
he was dialing back earlier comments he made to cnn in which he said the sonar equipment had located wreckage from the plane
indonesia's national search and rescue chief said the body of the aircraft hasn't yet been discovered
until now we haven't found the plane bambang soelistyo said according to indonesia's national news agency antara
we've only found seven bodies to this day
the grim discovery tuesday of parts of the missing plane and several bodies on the surface of the sea dealt a heartbreaking blow to families whose loved ones were lost
debris was found one hundred two hundred kilometers from the aircraft's last known location over the java sea indonesia's search and rescue agency said
seven bodies four men and three women have been recovered from the water so far soelistyo said
one of the women found was wearing a flight attendant's uniform he said
search teams are looking for other bodies and parts of the plane including its so called black boxes
those could help investigators determine what went wrong on the flight which lost contact with air traffic controllers on sunday with one hundred and sixty two people aboard
sonar equipment has been searching the bottom of the sea tens of meters below the water's surface according to sb supriyadi the search agency's director of operations
dozens of ambulances were lined up in the indonesian city of surabaya ready to carry any bodies recovered
the search isn't easy
heavy wind and rain as well as big waves are hampering efforts officials said
as families watched a live news conference tuesday about the discovery of the debris and saw video of a helicopter lowering a diver to what appeared to be a floating body some people fainted
stretchers were brought into the room
family members burst into tears dabbing their eyes as officials passed out tissues
some sat with their eyes full of tears hands covering their mouths or heads buried in their hands
others had phones jammed against their ears
everyone became hysterical especially the mothers
one mother even blacked out said maria endang wirasmi whose daughter son in law and two grandchildren were on the flight
her husband imam sampurno said he was relieved the plane had been found
we hope that our children will be saved by a miracle he said
airasia ceo tony fernandes told reporters he hoped there was at least some closure for families
my heart is filled with sadness for all the families involved in qz eight thousand five hundred and one he tweeted
on behalf of airasia my condolences to all
words can not express how sorry i am
soelistyo the head of indonesia's search and rescue agency said the debris was discovered when a crew on a military aircraft spotted the shadow of an object that looked like a plane in the water off the coast of indonesia's central kalimantan province on borneo
further searching found floating objects believed to be the bodies of passengers and then what appeared to be an emergency exit of the plane
officials sent other search teams racing to the area
several nations are contributing resources to the effort including the united states
the u.s. navy destroyer uss sampson arrived tuesday
the uss fort worth is also being prepared to deploy from singapore pentagon spokesman rear adm. john kirby said
it can be ready to sail in a day or two to get on station and can be there very quickly he said
the united states is also preparing maritime patrol aircraft that could help he said
the flight which was lost sunday on its way to singapore was carrying one hundred and fifty five passengers and seven crew members
the overwhelming majority were indonesians
there were also citizens of britain france malaysia singapore and south korea
search and rescue teams are diverting all their resources to where the debris is in the karimata strait about one hundred and ten nautical miles southwest of the indonesian city of pangkalan bun airasia said
fernandes said the focus for now must remain on the recovery effort and no sweeping changes were planned for the airline which has one thousand flights a day
but rest assured he said that once the investigation is done if there are things we need to change that we will change it
the airbus a three hundred and twenty two hundred lost contact with air traffic control early sunday shortly after the pilot requested permission to turn and climb to a higher altitude because of bad weather according to indonesian officials
authorities mounted a huge effort to find the aircraft mapping out a search zone covering one hundred and fifty six thousand square kilometers
questions remain about why flight eight thousand five hundred and one lost contact with air traffic control and what happened afterward
some experts have said the aircraft might have experienced an aerodynamic stall because of a lack of speed or from flying at too sharp an angle to get enough lift
analysts have also suggested the pilots might not have been getting information from onboard systems about the plane's position or that rain or hail from thunderstorms in the area could have damaged the engines
the key to understanding what happened is likely to be contained in the aircraft's flight recorders
until we get the black boxes we won't know what's going on with the engines said bill savage a former pilot with thirty years of experience
anguish revisited
relatives of mh three hundred and seventy victims speak out about airasia qz eight thousand five hundred and one

what happened to malaysia airlines flight three hundred and seventy and will we ever find it 
watch vanished
the mystery of malaysia airlines flight three hundred and seventy tonight at nine p.m
et
an airliner vanishes over the waters of a southeast asia ocean
there's no distress call no wreckage nothing but water and questions
so far the story of airasia flight qz eight thousand five hundred and one sounds remarkably similar to that of malaysia airlines mh three hundred and seventy which remains missing nearly ten months after it disappeared from radar screens on a flight between kuala lumpur malaysia and beijing
but it isn't analysts say
here are four ways the two incidents appear to differ
one
there's not anywhere near as much intrigue
when mh three hundred and seventy disappeared the plane's identifying transponders appeared to be intentionally shut off its pilots stopped making radio transmissions and the airliner made a mysterious turn before possibly traveling for hours until all traces vanished
concerns over hijackings and terror permeated that case but so far they haven't come up in the airasia case
in this case you had normal communications with the pilot a line of weather that appeared to be pretty difficult severe and he was asking to climb as high as he could to get out of it said peter goelz an aviation expert and former national transportation safety board official
two
the water is much shallower and a commonly used shipping channel making wreckage easier to find
the area where mh three hundred and seventy is believed to have gone down features extraordinarily deep water
it's also relatively mysterious the seabed had never been charted in some places making getting a fix on the plane's pingers very difficult
in the airasia case if the plane went down in the water it likely rests in no more than a few hundred feet of heavily traveled ocean making the task of locating and recovering it much simpler analysts say
three
airlines and governments have learned a lot since mh three hundred and seventy
in the hours after the malaysia airlines jetliner vanished in march confusion reigned
when officials spoke at all the information was often contradictory or confusing and families of passengers and crew complained about how they were treated
in this case both government and airline officials appear to be striking a more appropriate tone
families of airasia flight passengers given support through the nightmare 
airasia ceo tony fernandes tweeted that his only thought was the passengers and crew and pledged to do whatever we can
malaysian defense minister hishammuddin hussein also tweeted his support
i will be there with you he said
and the search appears to be getting off to a more efficient start
indonesian officials quickly posted a search plan indicating ships from its navy as well as assets from malaysia singapore and australia were being called to help
cnn's will ripley said the way fernandes is handling the crisis is notable
what he's doing is something that malaysia airlines did not do in the initial hours the initial days and weeks which is being very transparent acknowledging this is a terrible situation ripley said
in this case it appears as though the airline and the authorities are in sync and they really are putting the families first which is the way to do it
four
we almost certainly won't be searching for this plane in ten months
with a more precise fix on where the plane was when it lost contact a smaller search area and shallower seas the airliner almost certainly will be much easier to find said steven wallace former director of the federal aviation administration's office of accident investigations
it's very unlikely that we're going to see anything remotely close to what we saw with malaysia three hundred and seventy he said
it will not surprise me if this airplane is found in the next twelve hours of daylight because they know to a fairly high degree of certainty where it was the water is one hundred and fifty feet deep as opposed to ten or twenty thousand feet deep in the indian ocean

surabaya indonesia a woman grieving for her brother and his family
two teenage girls looking for their parents
a woman hoping her fiance is still alive
they are among the distraught families of passengers and crew on airasia flight qz eight thousand five hundred and one who are gathering at airports in the region hoping that their relatives are safe
the plane carrying one hundred and sixty two people disappeared sunday morning traveling from surabaya to singapore
oei endang sulsilowati and her daughter arrived at the juanda international aiport in surabaya looking for news of her brother oei jimmy sentosa winata his wife and their thirteen year old son and nine year old daughter
we saw what had happened on the television and we are coming here to find out what is happening sulsilowati said
her brother's family was traveling to japan via singapore she said
i knew about this incident from watching tv and tried to get more information from my family
but my brother never flew with airasia so i kept calm
then someone told me that they saw his name on tv
then i saw it she said breaking down in tears
we are just waiting for news
now they just wait
we don't know what to do she said
we are just waiting for news
two young teenage schoolgirls arrived at juanda international in the early hours
according to relatives and school officials who were traveling with the girls they are friends whose parents were on the flight
the parents were traveling to singapore to spend new year's with their daughters
that flight never arrived so the girls traveled to surabaya to find out what had happened to their parents
they sat at a desk staffed by airasia officials looking lost and bewildered as they waited for information
at changi airport in singapore louise sidharta told channel newsasia her fiance and his family were on the plane
when i was on the way to the airport i listened to the radio and they said his plane was missing she said
it was supposed to be his last vacation with his family before the wedding she said
indonesia is by far the hardest hit in this mystery because one hundred and forty nine of the one hundred and fifty five passengers were from that country
surabaya is the crisis center
airasia group ceo and founder tony fernandes flew in late sunday night
his first words at the news conference
we are very devastated by what's happened it's unbelievable
our concern right now is for the relatives and for the next of kin there is nothing more important to us for our crew's family and for the passengers families
on monday morning he briefed the families behind closed doors
it's not known what he said
airasia staff has been taking families from juanda international to the nearby ibis hotel to keep them together and critically to keep them informed
many family members are in shock
they're teary eyed exhausted confused and afraid
some are grieving
others exude pure despair
children are among them in some cases clearly too young to grasp what's going on
i should have gone with them but i canceled it two weeks ago as i had something to do one relative of a passenger said sobbing according to a translation by channel newsasia
speaking at juanda international airport the relative whose name was not given said this morning before i went to pray one of them called me and jokingly said see you in the new year and goodbye forever 
that's all and then the bad news came
we still have hope 
william kai waiting in surabaya for news of his brother in law and three other relatives who were on the flight said he's hopeful the plane will be found soon according to the bbc
this flight is only from surabaya to singapore so it's not like it's missing in the indian ocean or the big seas he said
it's just there
so it should be easier to find
he also said he's not giving up hope for the safe return of his relatives
we still have hope he said
we can not lose hope
the losses will be felt around the world
while nearly everyone on the flight is from indonesia there are also three south koreans one malaysian a french co pilot one briton and one singaporean the airline said
sixteen passengers were children and one was an infant
the british national is indonesia based energy executive choi chi man and the singaporean citizen is his two year old daughter zoe channel newsasia reported
their names are on a flight manifest released by the airline
airline vows to help families through the nightmare 
sunu widyatmoko the ceo of airasia indonesia said the company's main priority is keeping the families of our passengers and colleagues informed on the latest developments
we will do everything possible to support them as the investigation continues and have already mobilized a support team to help take care of their immediate needs including accommodation and travel arrangements he said
fernandes took to twitter to console families and offer more information
i am touched by the massive show of support especially from my fellow airlines he wrote
this is my worse nightmare
but there is no stopping
the company switched its logo on its twitter and facebook pages from bright red to gray
peter goelz a cnn aviation analyst chaired a task force that wrote the aviation disaster family assistance act of one thousand nine hundred and ninety six which the u.s. congress passed to provide guidance on how to deal with families when responding to these types of crises
that legislation set the worldwide standard in aviation disaster response according to goelz and iterations of it have been adopted by virtually every country including indonesia
the key is families need to hear it first
they need to hear what's going on and they need to hear it from the investigators goelz said on cnn's state of the union
if you don't get the information to the families it's just torturous
pope francis said sunday his thoughts are with those on board the missing airasia plane and with their loved ones
cnn's josh levs pierre meilhan anna maja rappard and yousuf basil contributed to this report

when we imagine the robots of the future they often look and move like humans standing up on two legs and using a pair of arms to grab and move objects
nasa's jet propulsion laboratory is working on a different kind of robot for disaster response that's designed to move like an ape
headless but covered with seven cameras that act as eyes the robotsimian has four identical limbs that do double duty as arms and legs
together they ably move the robot across rough terrain and rubble but can also pick up and manipulate objects
it has wheels it can coast on if the surface is smooth enough
the robosimian is jpl's final entry into the darpa robotics challenge a twenty seven month long competition among some of the world's top robotic talent to create an emergency response robot
in situations such as a nuclear disaster one of these robots could go into environments too dangerous for human rescue workers and execute simple tasks such as lifting debris off survivors or turning off a valve
in june robosimian and up to eighteen other finalists will have to make their way through an obstacle course that simulates eight common scenarios
each robot will attempt to drive a car move across rubble use a tool and climb stairs all without a human controlling it
darpa says the final competitors should be as competent as a two year old child
the winning team will receive a two million dollar prize
jpl used leftover parts from robosimian to create another robot called surrogate
the more traditional upright robot has a flexible spine head and two arms
while better at manipulating objects surrogate ran on tracks and wasn't as adept at traversing the complicated terrain that is common in a disaster
after considering both candidates the team decided to take robosimian to the finals
one trade off is that robosiman is slower than many other competitors
jpl's team is working with the university of california santa barbara and caltech to increase the robot's walking speed
it is intentionally the tortoise relative to the other hares in the competition.we feel that a very stable and deliberate approach suites our technical strengths and provides a model for one vital element of the ecosystem of robots that we expect to be deployed to disaster scenarios in the future said jpl's brett kennedy who is supervisor of the robotic vehicles and manipulators group
the jet propulsion laboratory is most known for designing robotics for space exploration such as the mars rovers
but the darpa competition was an opportunity for the jpl group to take its existing robotics research and compare approaches directly to other talented teams
nasa also has a long history of taking technology developed for space exploration and using it here on earth
robosimian software was influenced by programs used to control the mars rovers
in both cases the system is designed to let the robots work as autonomously as possible when communication with a human operator is dropped
spotty communications are common in disaster scenarios
the team has thought hard about all aspects of robosimian's design even making sure it has the right look
we included industrial designers in the team in an effort to create a robot that looked professional rather than either threatening or overly cute said kennedy
basically we wanted the perceptual equivalent of a st. bernard
while jpl is focused on perfecting the ape like design for earth bound applications for now this is just one stop in the circular life of nasa technology
we intend to spin the technologies developed for the terrestrial robosimian back out to applications in space said kennedy
these tasks include assembly and maintenance of orbital structures
exploration of low gravity bodies like asteroids comets and moons
exploration of caves and cliffs on mars or our moon
and even preconstruction of habitats wherever humans care to venture in the solar system

the mission of impact your world and our motto is change the story
not only do we bring you the latest news on all cnn's platforms but where possible we provide ways on the network and on cnn dot com impact to get involved and to donate to help those whose stories we tell
only sometimes we can't
a missing plane a sinking ferry a random act of violence whether it's in your state half way across the country or the other side of the world these tragedies appear on your phone at work in your living room
you feel powerless and so frequently do we
the instinct is to help
unfortunately sometimes effective ways to help are hard to come by
it's often while situations are still developing and cnn's coverage is the most in depth that the desire to impact is strongest
images of the family members of passengers on asia air eight thousand five hundred and one sobbing and desperate for news are heart wrenching
the families of passengers on the burning ferry pleading for rescuers to work faster fill us all with sadness horror and sympathy
they make us wonder
what if it were my child my mother my husband 
how can i help 
frustratingly it is often when stories are still evolving that the answer too frequently is that all we can do is wait
we don't know when or whether people will be found or what medical outcomes will be
we wish we did
sometimes ways to help are part of a bigger picture
when schoolgirls are kidnapped by a militant group it is in the hands of the governments to get them out and all we can do is wait
but to help stop it from ever happening again we can provide links to connect you with organizations working to overcome barriers to education for girls worldwide
we may not be able to stop children from being recruited as soldiers by armed militias but we can connect you with unicef who is working to end the participation of children in armed conflict
often we rely on you
we don't always know about how you are working to raise funds raise awareness volunteer or get involved
but we want to know so keep us in the loop by tweeting cnnimpact
sometimes the best way to get involved is to stay informed aware ask questions 
imagine if it were your child or parent spouse that was in harms way and ask could the response be improved 
at cnn our first jon is to bring you all the facts provide context and keep everyone involved honest
armed with this information we hope you'll decide just how you want to impact your world
but when tragedies unfold there will be times when all anyone can do is wait

lyndon johnson congress and the battle for the great society
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author
hillary clinton hasn't said whether she's going to run for president in two thousand and sixteen
and massachusetts sen. elizabeth warren has said repeatedly that she's not planning to run
but given the dynamics of today's politics the two women need each other
and they both should run for the democratic nomination
a primary challenge from warren could be the very best thing to happen to clinton in a run for the presidency
most pundits have argued that a warren challenge would be a problem that clinton needs to confront a genuine roadblock in her path to the presidency
the division and discord they say would be a repeat of the two thousand and eight primaries where she ultimately lost to barack obama
but a warren candidacy could have a very healthy effect for clinton and for the democratic party
the biggest challenge that clinton faces right now assuming that she decides to run is that she might be unable to generate enough excitement among democrats that would mobilize voters and excite the media in the general election
part of the problem revolves around the same old issue of inevitability
as in two thousand and eight people treat her candidacy as a given and assume that she would be the likely democratic nominee
in american politics voters tend to like the underdog
when clinton hit the campaign trail in two thousand and eight as the inevitable winner she often fell flat
obama used the image of inevitability against her
indeed some of the finest moments in her campaign came toward the end when it became clear that obama was probably going to win the nomination
her fight intensified and she made a much stronger appeal to key elements of the democratic party
as new york sen. chuck schumer recently reminded his party democrats do best when they deal with the issues facing the middle class and advance an agenda that focuses on economic security for all
far from being radical this has been the kind of policy agenda for which democratic voters thirst
it was the heart of the new deal and the great society as well as successful democratic midterm campaigns and the two thousand and eight election
in recent times democrats have done well when they pay attention to the middle class and suffer when they move too far away from these issues
this kind of agenda could inspire democratic voters and attract independents who are frustrated with the continued challenges facing the middle class
if warren forces clinton to confront these issues and to articulate a stronger response to the economic issues of our days creating countervailing pressure to the political experts who will implore her to stay away from these questions it would only make the former first lady and secretary of state a stronger candidate
warren's candidacy would force clinton to put herself on the record over how she would help the middle class committing to the kinds of policies that will be desirable to many voters including some independents and even moderate republicans who are struggling in this economy and who are uncomfortable with the solutions offered by a gop that continues to lean hard to the right
a warren candidacy would also put pressure on clinton's team to make sure they pay close attention to the grass roots
in the two thousand and eight primaries the clinton campaign faltered in dealing with the political ground war the job of mobilizing and organizing local activists and deploying social media to bring out supporters
if there is no democratic challenger clinton might not do enough to prepare for the onslaught she would face from a gop a party armed with tea party activists and a huge network of campaign donors ready for battle
if warren runs clinton will be forced to have her campaign infrastructure in place and in top form before the general election campaign begins
there is also the virtue of clinton sharpening her basic campaign skills
although she has never really left politics since her husband's election as president in one thousand nine hundred and ninety two she is probably a bit rusty as her book rollout in june showed
in the current media environment there is no room for mistakes and given that the republicans might have some pretty strong candidates in the mix she will have to be at the top of her game
clinton is an immensely skilled politician and can compete with the best but the challenge of running against warren would make her stronger by the fall of two thousand and sixteen
both candidates would benefit from a real primary
polls show clinton has a commanding lead against any challenger including warren so the odds are this would not be a genuine threat to her nomination
but a primary would vastly enhance warren's stature on capitol hill and give her a bigger profile within the party for years to come
for clinton a vigorous challenge from the base of the party will be just the kind of competitive spur that she needs

the strike which took place in the area of saakow was targeting a senior leader of the islamist militant group
at this time we do not assess there to be any civilian or bystander casualties
we are assessing the results of the operation and will provide additional information when appropriate as details become available kirby said in a statement
the strike was carried out by an unmanned aircraft and was an operation of the u.s. defense department according to a u.s. defense official who spoke on the condition of anonymity
on saturday somalia government forces captured a top al shabaab commander said two of the country's military officials
zakariya ismail ahmed hersi al shabaab's intelligence chief was captured in a house near the town of el wak somali military commander isack hussein mursal told state run radio
he was a close associate of former al shabaab leader ahmed abdi godane who was killed in a u.s. airstrike near barawe city in september
the capture came after militants with the group which is linked to al qaeda attacked a large african union base in mogadishu last week killing three ugandan soldiers and a civilian
al shabaab has said that attack was revenge for the u.s. airstrike that killed godane
the state department had offered a seven million dollar reward for information on godane's location

the patient is a health care worker who was helping to combat the disease in west africa and returned from sierra leone late sunday night the scottish health agency nhs scotland said
the patient flew via casablanca morocco and london heathrow airport arriving at glasgow airport on a british airways flight around eleven thirty p.m. the statement said
the patient was admitted to hospital early in the morning after feeling unwell and was placed into isolation at seven point five zero a.m. all possible contacts with the patient are now being investigated and anyone deemed to be at risk will be contacted and closely monitored
however having been diagnosed in the very early stages of the illness the risk to others is considered extremely low
nicola sturgeon scotland's head of government led a meeting of the scottish government resilience committee to ensure all necessary steps are being taken and she spoke with british prime minister david cameron nhs scotland said
following established protocol the patient will be transferred to the high level isolation unit in the royal free hospital london as soon as possible
this is where the facilities staff and systems are in place to ensure the best quality and safest care
access to the unit is restricted to specially trained medical staff
a specially designed tent with controlled ventilation will be set up over the patient's bed
scotland has been preparing for this possibility from the beginning of the outbreak in west africa and i am confident that we are well prepared sturgeon said in the statement
we have the robust procedures in place to identify cases rapidly
our health service also has the expertise and facilities to ensure that confirmed ebola cases such as this are contained and isolated effectively minimizing any potential spread of the disease
she added scotland's nhs has proved it is well able to cope with infectious diseases in the past such as swine flu and i am confident we will be able to respond effectively again
the patient was working with save the children at an ebola treatment center in sierra leone according to michael von bertele humanitarian director at that organization

flights to london's gatwick airport were diverted and departures delayed for a time monday after a virgin atlantic plane made an emergency landing the airport said
flight vs forty three heading to las vegas landed safely at gatwick after developing a technical fault with its landing gear virgin atlantic said
the airport's runway was closed temporarily while the the plane was removed
it reopened at around seven p.m. local time and inbound and outbound flights resumed according to the airport
the airport warned however that it might take some time before normal services resume
gatwick describes itself on its website as the most efficient single runway airport in the world
gatwick earlier said it had put its emergency services on standby for vs forty three a boeing seven hundred and forty seven to make a non standard landing
in line with standard procedure emergency services are on standby at the airport purely as a precaution it said on twitter
virgin atlantic's richard branson praised the plane's pilots on twitter
well done virginatlantic pilots and team for safe and skillful landing of vs forty three
thoughts with passengers and crew thanks for support and patience
virgin atlantic ceo craig kreeger said in a statement that the airline understood that the incident would have significantly disrupted people's holiday plans

a suicide bomber wearing an explosive vest blew himself up among mourners inside a funeral tent on a farm about twelve miles north of baghdad iraq on monday according to police
at least twenty one people were killed and thirty five others injured at the funeral in al taji a mostly sunni district officials said
the funeral was for a member of the local awakening council a group also known as the sons of iraq and sahawat made up of sunni arab fighters who turned against al qaeda
iraqi security forces believe that isis militants were behind the attack
awakening councils are u.s. backed groups that have been active in iraq since two thousand and six
a few years ago the councils were credited as being a major factor in a drop in violence across iraq but council members have also become targets for jihadists

abu dhabi in a series of blunt tweets over the holiday weekend iran's supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei entered america's debate on race and police violence comparing unrest in states like new york and missouri to conflicts in the middle east
on sunday he tweeted
jesus endured sufferings to oppose tyrants who had put humans in hell in this worldand the hereafter while he backed the oppressed
ferguson
ayatollah ali khamenei the country's chief political and religious authority acknowledged the role of jesus in islamic theology and compared the biblical prophet's struggle to that of black people in the united states
the tweet included blacklivesmatter a hashtag popularized in recent weeks by supporters of eric garner a forty three year old african american man that died after being put in a chokehold by a nypd officer
it read
it's expected that followers of jesus follow him in his fight against arrogants and in his support for the oppressed
blacklivesmatter
on christmas eve the ayatollah lumped the struggle of palestinians in the gaza strip with protests in ferguson missouri where black teenager michael brown was shot dead by police and called on members of all three monotheistic faiths to stand up against oppression
the tweet said
jesus like all prophets was herald of monotheismand human dignity
nowadays humanity needs this message more than ever.ferguson gaza one one ninety three
the unverified twitter account widely accepted as the mouthpiece of the ayatollah's social media campaign often posts diatribes against the west and israel to its more than ninety one thousand followers
in august of this year the leader published a poignant image that criticized president barack obama's support for israel during the country's military operation to debilitate hamas a group many western nations including the u.s. designate as a terrorist organization
us govt has subjugated a great nation with massive resources to a criminal regime like israel
ferguson gaza it said
in response some twitter users accused the ayatollah of hypocrisy and tweeted him with hashtags such as alllivesmatter gaylivesmatter and kurdishlivesmatter
human rights groups and observers regularly criticize the country for its poor record on executions the treatment of political prisoners and women

in late november many found their entertainment lifeline cut off as authorities shut down two of the country's most popular file sharing sites one with countless episodes of u.s. tv series and the other with meticulously translated chinese subtitles for those shows
state media called the sites known copyright infringers
the sites themselves claimed to be free platforms for people who want to learn about american language and culture not money making ventures
worse still fans quickly realized their only viable alternative china's legitimate video streaming sites may soon fall victim to the censors tightening grip
almost no current u.s. tv series air on china's broadcast and cable networks
in february viewers and critics hailed the release of hit political thriller house of cards on video site sohu at the same time it aired on netflix in the u.s. as a sign of liberalization in china's strictly controlled media market
many sohu users binge watched all thirteen episodes of the second season which appeared uncensored despite unflattering story lines about china's ruling communist elite
it had clocked more than one hundred and three million views by mid december more than double netflix's fifty million global subscribers
but the sense of optimism among fans quickly dissipated when in april without warning the government banned four popular american tv series including the top rated sitcom the big bang theory on all streaming sites
officials cited violations of copyrights laws and content regulations without giving specifics even though the shows had been purchased and allowed to stream online for several seasons
fans are bracing for more disappointment
china's broadcast regulator has strongly hinted from april two thousand and fifteen it would only approve healthy content to be streamed online a troubling prospect for followers of such shows as zombie horror drama the walking dead and steamy period drama masters of sex
what's more online broadcasters may have to wait for a show's entire season to air in the u.s. before streaming it in china
hardcore followers say they dread the prospect of having to wait to watch chopped versions of their beloved shows on streaming sites
many young urban and well educated fans insist given the rising government restrictions only illicit file sharing services offer the quick and unfettered access they crave
i've been stockpiling shows by downloading as much as possible it's the only way to make me feel safe explained zhao tianshu thirty a beijing lawyer who considers watching american legal dramas like the good wife one of the four shows banned in april on his ipad in the gym a daily highlight
i understand copyright concerns but the policy just seems arbitrary said feng huiling twenty three a social work graduate student in the chinese capital who breathlessly lists more than a dozen american tv shows that she regularly watches
what alarms censors fans and analysts argue is the immense popularity of those shows with a new episode often attracting millions of views or downloads within hours
the following used to be small but now it's gotten so huge that officials become nervous about the impact and feel compelled to do something about it said wu yeni thirty two a beijing based corporate publicist who compares watching american tv series to getting a cup of starbucks coffee another of her addictions
jeremy goldkorn a leading commentator on china's media landscape said it was surprising how american tv series posted on chinese video sites had been allowed to proliferate with very little government interference
they are now putting these measures in place to make sure it doesn't become an ideological threat he said
this helps them better micromanage the content and frighten internet companies into complying with regulations
even shows that manage to get into china sometimes disappear
madam secretary a new political drama that debuted this past autumn is widely streamed online in china
nowhere to be found however is its fourth episode which features some of china's taboo subjects
the tiananmen crackdown the one child policy and a territorial dispute between china and japan
people will wearily accept the new normal of rising censorship under an increasingly powerful and hardline president xi jinping predicts goldkorn
anybody associated with thought work or ideology or the image of china everything is being squeezed or tightened or limited he said
goldkorn also said the new rules have a commercial rationale
they don't want people to get too hooked on foreign shows and not to watch any chinese content
long danni the president of ee media a major entertainment company based in shanghai told cnn that the new policies help domestic tv producers like her
we'll have plenty more high quality original programming to conquer not just the chinese but the global market
fans of american tv are not so sure
for now many try to explore technical workarounds to new government restrictions and insist that no matter what happens they won't watch domestic shows known for their over the top propaganda and low production values
if they totally shut the door to american tv it would be tragic said wu the corporate publicist who equates her desire for u.s. shows to that for caffeine
it would be just tragic if you couldn't even choose your own entertainment

beijing is making it harder for chinese to watch american tv shows

prepping for their ultimate self portrait vintage cameras docked on old tripods pucker up for their own selfie against backdrops that bring out their best qualities
no filters necessary
these unusual photos offer a view of the oft forgotten film cameras that brought us to the digital age and ushered in the selfie
wanting to capture the rich history of analog in a modern striking fashion photographer and engineer jrgen novotny developed cameraselfies a continuing project featuring cameras from the one thousand nine hundred and twenty s onward
novotny has a personal tie to some of these antique cameras
the agfa silette was a gift from his father when he turned six
it gave him the outlet to deal with his creative boosts he said the freedom to isolate moods and generate special subjective views on a situation
this passion turned into a portfolio with styles ranging from still life to surreal landscapes
novotny could think of no better way to pay homage to the medium of his work than by having the cameras themselves display their true colors
he began to collect historic cameras from friends or on auction sites like ebay for little to nothing
i learned that nondigital cameras seemed in fact to be forgotten
beautiful and still great equipment i couldn't afford a few years ago are now available for a few bucks
good for me but somehow sad novotny said reminding him a bit of the toy story movie
what if those abandoned and forgotten cameras would try to depict themselves and their situation 
without users anymore looking back upon their glorious times 
he said
thus the idea for cameraselfies was born
the photographs themselves are not selfies in the traditional definition
novotny captures them with his modern digital fujifilm x t one in a small modest studio
i tried to capture them in their natural and chronologically correct environment on backgrounds of contemporary wallpapers he said
cameraselfies uses the selfiemania trend to remind the viewer of the origins of photography and also keep in mind that expressive photography is more than noise reduction smile detection and technical specifications he said
these cameras are not only tools reduced to their technical data but also still an inspiration for artists and a source for creativity
here the viewer is out of the frame the cameras and the creative potential they offer stand in the foreground

the disappearance of airasia flight eight thousand five hundred and one between indonesia and singapore over the weekend and discovery of debris from the plane two days later caps a bizarre year in aviation
but could two thousand and fourteen be the worst year in recent aviation history 
yes and no
depends on how you define worst
in terms of crashes two thousand and fourteen has seen the lowest number in more than eighty years says the geneva based bureau of aircraft accidents archives or baaa
with the airasia disappearance now counted as a crash this year's number totals one hundred and eleven
the last time the world had one hundred and eleven crashes was in one thousand nine hundred and twenty seven
if you consider sheer numbers of aircraft crashes flying today is safer says kane ray an analyst with the international bureau of aviation a global aviation consulting group
however there are more aircraft in the sky so naturally the overall number may appear similar to previous decades and in some categories of disaster higher
in terms of fatalities the numbers paint a grimmer picture
before airasia qz eight thousand five hundred and one aviation disasters this year claimed one thousand one hundred and fifty eight lives
the airasia flight was carrying one hundred and sixty two people
authorities have not issued a statement on whether everybody died
if all the people on board died this year would have the most aviation deaths one thousand three hundred and twenty since two thousand and five according to baaa
already two thousand and fourteen has put an end to a steadily improving global aviation safety record
every ten years or so we have a year that is less safe than others
unfortunately this year was one of those said ronan hubert with the baaa
last year two hundred and sixty five people were killed in flight incidents marking the safest year in aviation since one thousand nine hundred and forty five the aviation safety network said
the aviation safety network and the baaa track their numbers differently
the aviation safety network says its figures on fatal aircraft accidents include only civil aircraft of which the basic model has been certified for carrying fourteen or more passengers
the baaa includes accidents of aircraft capable of carrying at least six passengers besides the crew
another key difference
the aviation safety network doesn't include fatalities from malaysia airlines flight seventeen because it does not count shoot downs or acts of sabotage in its safety indicator numbers
the baaa statistics count any event where aircraft suffered such damage that it is not in a position to be used anymore
before two thousand and fourteen malaysia airlines had an excellent safety record
then in march malaysia airlines flight three hundred and seventy disappeared en route from kuala lumpur to beijing with two hundred and thirty nine aboard
officials believe that plane is somewhere in the indian ocean
but nine months later mh three hundred and seventy hasn't been found
in july malaysia airlines flight seventeen was shot down over eastern ukraine killing all two hundred and ninety eight aboard
while airasia is based in malaysia the flight that crashed sunday was operated by airasia indonesia an affiliate with hubs in jakarta and surabaya
the wreckage was not found until tuesday creating a fear that two airliners had disappeared in the same year in the same part of the world
search teams located airasia debris on tuesday in the java sea
airasia had a near flawless safety record with no previous fatal accidents
but now that record has changed
this is my worst nightmare airasia ceo tony fernandes tweeted as crews searched for airasia qz eight thousand five hundred and one
two other disasters claimed dozens of lives both in july
in taiwan forty eight died on transasia airways flight two hundred and twenty two
the cause of that crash is unclear
the crash of air algerie flight five thousand and seventeen killed one hundred and sixteen people while en route from burkina faso to algeria
the plane went down in mali
the cause of that crash is also uncertain but the plane changed flight paths because of bad weather
when air disasters happen they make news
but on the whole far fewer people die in plane crashes than in cars
about one point two four million people die each year on the world's roads the world health organization said last year
by contrast the deadliest year in aviation had three thousand three hundred and forty six deaths the baaa said
that was in one thousand nine hundred and seventy two
since then technology has improved and airlines insurance companies and regulators have worked to increase aviation safety levels to get closer to zero risk said hubert
accidents are not always avoidable he said but with each accident we learn something new and improve
according to the international civil aviation organization the number of commercial flight departures has grown in recent years to thirty million in two thousand and eleven
despite the fatalities from this year goelz said that's a relatively low rate when you compare it to the massive numbers of people who are flying today

an oil slick the sound of a distant ping objects in the water and now this
smoke spotted rising from an island in the java sea
as ships planes and helicopters scour the waters off indonesia's coast for missing airasia flight qz eight thousand five hundred and one there have been several reports of possible signs of the missing plane
so far officials say none of them have panned out
on tuesday search teams will be checking the area where indonesian navy helicopter crews saw the smoke the head of search and rescue in the province of bangka belitung told cnn indonesia
but authorities don't know whether there's any connection to the missing jet
local media in indonesia reported the smoke was seen on long island one of thousands that make up the archipelago that forms indonesia
searchers have been scanning the water's surface for signs of the plane which went missing with one hundred and sixty two people aboard on sunday as it flew between the islands of belitung and borneo a heavily traveled shipping channel with shallow waters
our early conjecture is that the plane is in the bottom of the sea said bambang sulistyo the head of indonesia's search and rescue agency
that belief is based on the plane's flight track and last known coordinates he said
several possible signs of the missing plane including an oil slick within the search zone and the sound of a faint ping have been discounted according to indonesian authorities who are heading the search
indonesia vice president jusuf kalla said there were some reports from australia about possible objects found but it was unclear whether they were from the plane
because there is a great deal of traffic along the water in the search area authorities have cautioned that objects found might have nothing to do with the missing aircraft
rescuers say weather was probably a factor in the plane's disappearance and it has made finding traces of the plane more difficult
large waves and clouds hampered the search for the plane on sunday and monday
it is not easy of course
the operation in the sea especially in the bad weather like this kalla said
but kalla said his country will not give up or set a time limit for the operation
the search area is expanding with six zones added to the operation on tuesday sulistyo told reporters
now he said teams in the air on sea and on land are searching thirteen zones over an area that stretches about one hundred and fifty six thousand square kilometers
airasia says air traffic controllers lost contact with the aircraft at seven twenty four a.m. sunday singapore time
the plane flying from the indonesian city of surabaya to singapore went missing as it flew over the java sea between the islands of belitung and borneo a heavily traveled shipping channel with shallow waters indonesian authorities said
before the plane an airbus a three hundred and twenty two hundred lost contact with air traffic controllers one of the pilots asked to change course and fly at a higher altitude because of bad weather officials said
heavy thunderstorms were reported in the area at the time
air traffic control approved the pilot's request to turn left but denied permission for the plane to climb to thirty eight thousand feet from thirty two thousand feet djoko murjatmodjo an aviation official at the indonesian transport ministry told the national newspaper kompas
the increased altitude request was denied because there was another plane flying at that height he said
djoko suggested that flight eight thousand five hundred and one ascended despite air traffic control denying it permission
airasia ceo tony fernandes said storm clouds caused the pilot to ask for a flight plan change
but he added we don't want to speculate whether weather was a factor
we really don't know
once the aircraft is found there will be a proper investigation fernandes said
relatives to be flown over search area
amid the anxious wait family members of the passengers have attended closed door briefings with airport and airline officials at the airport in surabaya
oei endang sulsilowati and her daughter were looking for information about her brother his wife and their two children
we don't know what to do sulsilowati said
we are just waiting for news
a specially chartered plane will fly relatives of passengers over the search area wednesday airasia indonesia ceo sunu widjatmoko told reporters in surabaya on tuesday
the chartered airbus a three hundred and twenty that will take families from surabaya over the zone has room for as many as one hundred and eighty people he said
some police said authorities were seeking additional materials to help identify passengers such as photos with close ups of teeth dna or fingerprints
but police officials later told cnn they were not immediately seeking these materials
east java police have set up a disaster victims identification area at the surabaya airport
of the people on board the passenger jet one hundred and fifty five are indonesian three are south korean one is british one is french one is malaysian and one is singaporean the airline said
eighteen children including one infant are among the passengers the carrier said
seven of the people on board are crew members
families of airasia flight passengers given support through the nightmare 
since the flight disappeared in indonesian airspace indonesia is heading up search efforts
more than one thousand one hundred search and rescue personnel from australia singapore malaysia south korea japan and new zealand are joining the search alongside indonesia's teams cnn indonesia reported
the missing plane is made by airbus a french company
and france has dispatched two investigators to indonesia
they are due to arrive in jakarta on monday france's foreign ministry said
malaysia's transportation minister said his country has deployed three vessels and three aircraft to assist in the search
and the royal australian air force said monday that it was deploying a patrol plane to help
the uss sampson is on its way to the java sea to assist in the search for the missing airasia plane a senior u.s. military official told cnn chief national security correspondent jim sciutto
the sampson a guided missile destroyer based in san diego deployed in october to take part in maritime security exercises and training in the pacific
china will dispatch aircraft and ships to participate in search and rescue efforts the chinese ministry of national defense said tuesday
airasia a successful budget airline group headquartered in malaysia had a clean safety record until the disappearance of flight eight thousand five hundred and one
the missing plane is operated by the company's indonesian affiliate
the loss of contact with the plane comes nearly ten months after the disappearance of malaysia airlines flight three hundred and seventy which dropped off radar over southeast asia on march eight with two hundred and thirty nine people on board
airasia and mh three hundred and seventy cases are very different
searchers have yet to find any remains of flight three hundred and seventy which officials believe went down in the southern indian ocean after mysteriously flying thousands of kilometers away from its planned route from kuala lumpur to beijing
but some aviation experts don't think the search for flight eight thousand five hundred and one will be as challenging as the hunt for mh three hundred and seventy
we are not talking about the deep indian ocean here cnn aviation correspondent richard quest said
we are talking about congested airspace around southeast asia
there will be much better radar coverage
there's certainly better air traffic control coverage

editor's note
les abend is a boeing seven hundred and seventy seven captain for a major airline with thirty years of flying experience
he is also a cnn aviation analyst and senior contributor to flying magazine
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author
before the world reaches a conclusion as to the outcome of airasia flight qz eight thousand five hundred and one it's important to understand that the details are far too limited for drawing a parallel to malaysia flight three hundred and seventy
implying that the airplane disappeared suggests it vanished into thin air
at this point the airbus a three hundred and twenty has simply not been found but the search is in its infancy compared with the months of searching since malaysia airline's boeing seven hundred and seventy seven went missing in march
a crucial difference in the flight eight thousand five hundred and one event is that the airplane had been in constant radar contact at least from the information provided thus far
radar data from air traffic control can provide tracking data that will indicate the flight path altitude and direction the a three hundred and twenty two hundred followed
this will assist in more accurately defining the search area
with malaysia three hundred and seventy radar data was sketchy
satellite data has been the primary source in determining the track and thus the search area
although it appears airasia eight thousand five hundred and one flew through a large area of convective weather this fact might have been a contributing cause and not the only cause of the event
no matter how obvious it might appear airplane incidents and accidents generally involve more than one factor
any good accident investigator will tell you that it is important not to focus on one theory until all the facts have been ascertained
so what could have occurred 
no doubt the crew was attempting to circumnavigate thunderstorm cells through the use of sophisticated on board weather radar
on occasion deviating around storm activity becomes a matter of determining the path that has a lower probability of turbulence encounters
airline pilots always attempt complete avoidance steering a wide berth around thunderstorms
unfortunately route restrictions other aircraft traffic and altitude constraints sometimes prevent our flights from deviating as far as we'd like
this isn't to say we jeopardize safety only that we might not be able to provide the most comfortable conditions for flying
experience dictates much of the decision process that airline pilots use to deviate around convective weather
operation of the radar itself can be an art with respect to adjusting the tilt angle and intensity the antenna reflects on the display screen
although airliners are structurally designed to withstand turbulence intentional flight into a thunderstorm is never an option
and let's not be misled by the reported request of flight eight thousand five hundred and one asking air traffic control for a higher altitude
this request may not have been an indication of a problem
oftentimes a request for a higher altitude is to provide a smoother ride
yes it is possible to top a thunderstorm cell but most airline pilots attempt to turn away from the weather because turbulence can still be encountered above a building storm cell
but there may be other contributing factors to the possible loss of airasia flight eight thousand five hundred and one
investigators will want to know whether the pitot tubes that provide airspeed data to the cockpit computer systems froze as a result of a heater failure similar to the circumstances with air france flight four hundred and forty seven
erroneous airspeed data would send confusing information to the instrument panel displays
because of the confusing information pilots would have difficulty reacting
it is also possible that the airplane flew through heavy precipitation flaming out both engines
although the a three hundred and twenty is designed to continue flying without engine power being able to control it at high altitude would be a challenge especially in turbulent conditions
if the airplane flew to the limits of its capabilities in regard to altitude the difference between maximum airspeed and its lowest airspeed would have been a very small margin
perhaps a high altitude stall occurred and the airplane never recovered
regardless of any speculation it is much too early for theories
for the moment i am keeping my fingers crossed that a search and rescue operation will find survivors
bigger miracles have occurred

in the end at least ten people died the italian coast guard said on monday
but many more were saved four hundred and twenty seven the coast guard said
ute kilger was one of those who survived
we were wet and cold and the rain was like needles she said
there was always these explosions and this feeling you have in your feet
it goes through your body
talking to cnn in donated red cross pajamas she stumbled over her words
it was unreal but i knew it is so real
this was really bad to really know it is real
the italian coast guard earlier said that all remaining passengers had been evacuated from the vessel with the boat's commander finally leaving the ship at two fifty p.m. monday
the coast guard said it was inspecting the ship and deciding how to transport it and where
the public prosecutor in bari italy said he had requested the seizure of the ship as part of a criminal investigation
authorities are waiting for authorization from albanian officials to release the ship because it is in albanian waters
giuseppe volpe the prosecutor added that the owner and the captain of the ship will be notified of the investigation
no charges have been filed
more than four hundred passengers were traveling on the norman atlantic between the greek port of igoumenitsa and the italian port of ancona when the fire began apparently in the ferry's parking bay
in the first three hours of the fire around one hundred and fifty people were able to escape via the vessel's lifeboats
but when the ferry lost power the electronic arms were unable to function leaving the rest of the boats dangling uselessly by its side
after waiting for hours in rough conditions one greek man told italian state broadcaster rai tv that passengers were dying of cold and suffocating from the smoke and that their feet were burning from the heat of the flames
helicopters with night vision equipment worked through the night to pull passengers off the ferry one by one
an italian navy medical team boarded the ship to aid passengers some of whom had been suffering hypothermia and smoke inhalation the navy said
the already cold conditions were worsened by the spray from tugboat hoses as authorities attempted to douse the flames
a freighter carrying forty nine rescued passengers arrived at the port of bari on monday
photos showed survivors wrapped in emergency foil blankets being carried away on stretchers
one man died after he jumped or fell into the cold water authorities said
it is unclear how the other victims died
dramatic cell phone images filmed by a passenger showed flames through shattered portholes while a wider view released by rescuers showed a huge plume of thick black smoke streaming from the stricken vessel
many passengers were unable to reach the lower decks because of the heat and the water below was so cold that jumping clear of the ferry was not an option
sea surface temperatures had been around fourteen to fifteen degrees celsius cnn meteorologist tom sater said which would have limited the survival time in the water to six hours at most
passengers told greek and italian newsgroups they had felt like prisoners on a burning ship
it's not known how the fire started but it is believed to have originated in the parking bay

comanche owned by netscape co founder jim clark and his wife australian model kristy hinze clark had to settle for second behind history maker wild oats xi in the seventy th running of the bluewater classic 
wild oats xi became the first boat to achieve eight line honors surpassing the seven line honors of morna later called kurrewa iv in the one thousand nine hundred and fifty s and sixty s when it crossed the finish line in two days two hours three minutes and twenty six seconds sunday
comanche had been closing the gap in the six hundred and twenty eight nautical mile race but ultimately was forty nine minutes slower than wild oats xi which is owned by wine magnate robert oatley
to rewrite a bit of sailing history doesn't come along every day wild oats xi's skipper mark richards was quoted as saying by the race's official website
to win a hobart is a great honor but to win an eighth i can't believe i am here
comanche was unbelievably impressive down sydney harbour and the whole first night she had the legs on us
we thought how are we going to handle this thing 
it was definitely our toughest race to have a boat so close for so much of the race especially when she's faster than you
i said to the guys we've got to hang in there hang tough minimize our losses and wait for the first opportunity we get to attack 
that opportunity came in the bass strait
the lighter conditions suited wild oats xi which opened up a big lead
we were about a quarter of the way into bass strait and expecting a westerly breeze and all of a sudden stan came up from down below and said i just got a new weather file this is not looking good comanche skipper ken read was quoted as saying by the race's official website
we were two miles ahead of them in bumpy seas and they literally went by us probably going a knot or two faster at the time and they just sailed into more pressure and just kept extending on the whole fleet
both boats sailed a flawless race but they had their day
they had twelve hours where they had wild oats weather but that's racing
while it wasn't known whether comanche would return next year oatley said wild oats xi would be back
we will be back next year yes we'll definitely be back next year oatley was quoted as saying by the race's website
she is the best boat in the world
she's proved that

the regional governor mijiyawa bakary confirmed the attack by the nigeria based islamist militants but did not give further details
we are still gathering the facts from our divisional officers but what we know for now is that the attackers killed at least twenty three people
the damage could be more he said
the attackers also burned down a village security forces told cnn
a soldier on the front who did not want to be named told cnn by phone that the insurgents carried out a similar attack along the waza mora highway on friday killing one cameroonian soldier
the soldier said a corporal was killed and three soldiers were wounded
the attackers also confiscated a land cruiser belonging to the cameroon military
earlier this month the country's state run broadcaster crtv reported that one hundred and sixteen boko haram fighters and one cameroonian soldier were killed during an attack that the militant group launched against a military column in northern cameroon
and in may boko haram militants kidnapped ten chinese road construction workers in waza just miles from the border with nigeria and killed one worker
the hostages were freed in october
boko haram has terrorized northern nigeria regularly since two thousand and nine attacking police schools churches and civilians and bombing government buildings
the islamist group considered one of the world's most deadly terrorist organizations has said its aim is to impose a stricter enforcement of sharia law across nigeria which is split between a majority muslim north and a mostly christian south
increasingly it has crossed into northern cameroon attacking military forces as well as kidnapping foreign nationals
but there is no firm evidence the group has ambitions beyond nigeria

one man died trying to escape a burning ferry in the adriatic sea on sunday afternoon and hundreds more were awaiting rescue as night fell on the beleaguered vessel
rescue crews worked into the night to airlift passengers by helicopter from the italian flagged norman atlantic which caught on fire sunday morning off the coast of greece
in the early hours of monday morning the italian coast guard confirmed that two hundred and one people had been rescued
it's believed two hundred and seventy six are still on board the burning vessel
the fire has been contained but smoke and weather conditions hindered extracting passengers in metal baskets from the ferry
they are being transported to merchant ships and an italian navy transport dock from where they will eventually continue on to the italian port of brindisi or hospitals
passengers suffering from smoke inhalation and hypothermia will be brought to hospitals in southern italy the italian coast guard said
with rescue efforts under way the focus of italian and greek media is shifting to the cause of the blaze which is believed to have started in the ship's parking bay
at least one truck driver told the greek news media that trucks filled with oil were packed like sardines cargo scraping the ceiling which could have set off sparks in rough seas to start a fire he surmised
those remaining on board awaited rescue on the upper deck dying of cold and suffocating from the smoke even as their feet were burning from the fire's heat said a greek passenger who called italy's state broadcaster rai tv
the disaster made national headlines in greece italy and other countries with citizens aboard the ferry
in a sunday morning public address pope francis offered affection and prayers to those affected by the norman atlantic ferry fire as well as a collision in the adriatic sea between two merchant ships
thick clouds of smoke enveloped the vessel earlier sunday as rescuers awaited an opportunity to approach
at least eight ships were deployed but heavy winds and freezing waters kept them at bay making evacuation by air the only feasible option
turkish diplomatic personnel are heading to igoumenitsa the likely port for evacuated passengers according to a turkish foreign ministry statement
turkish citizens were among the passengers with greeks and italians making up the majority

indonesia's top rescue official says authorities believe the missing airasia jet is likely at the bottom of the sea based on radar data from the plane's last contact
the coordinate that was given to us and the evolution from the calculation point of the flight track is at sea our early conjecture is that the plane is in the bottom of the sea bambang sulistyo head of indonesia's national search and rescue agency told reporters monday
but searchers still don't know where the plane is he said and may need help from other countries for help with an underwater search
the search for airasia flight qz eight thousand five hundred and one resumed on monday a day after the commercial jet disappeared in indonesian airspace with one hundred and sixty two people aboard
ships planes and helicopters are looking for the missing aircraft indonesian authorities said
it's unclear if weather played a role in the aircraft's disappearance but rescuers say it could be a factor that influences how quickly they find the plane
large waves and clouds hampered the search for the plane on sunday the agency said
by monday morning weather in the area appeared to be clearing up cnn international meteorologist tom sater said
airasia says air traffic controllers lost contact with the aircraft at seven twenty four a.m. sunday singapore time
the missing plane flying from the indonesian city of surabaya to singapore went missing as it flew over the java sea between the islands of belitung and borneo a heavily traveled shipping channel with shallow waters according to indonesian authorities who are leading the search and rescue operations
before the plane lost contact with air traffic controllers one of the pilots asked to fly at a higher altitude because of bad weather officials said
in addition to indonesia's teams several other countries have joined the hunt for the missing plane
a c one hundred and thirty plane from singapore has been participating in the search and the country's military says it's sending two more ships to the search area
malaysia's transportation minister said his country has deployed three vessels and three aircraft to assist in the search
and the royal australian air force said monday that it was deploying a patrol plane to help
and indonesia has reached out to the united kingdom france and the united states for help with sonar technology that may be needed for an underwater search sulistyo told reporters monday
now that a day has passed since the plane went missing investigators should have more data to help them find it said peter goelz former managing director of the u.s. national transportation safety board
they've had a full twenty four hours now to gather all of the available radar data from all of the available sources he said
they should be able to put that together along with any satellite data and have a more precise location on where to target their search
after hours of waiting in anguish for any word about the passengers aboard the missing plane several dozen of their family members met with airport and airline officials in a closed door briefing monday at the airport in surabaya
as they waited for news before the briefing some took cell phone pictures of a flight manifest posted on a wall
the black and white papers showed every passenger's name and seat number but not their fate
others simply sat and dabbed tears from their eyes
our concern right now is for the relatives and the next of kin airasia ceo tony fernandes said during a news conference in surabaya
he confirmed that storm clouds caused the pilot to ask for a change in flight plan but added we don't want to speculate whether weather was a factor
we really don't know
once the aircraft is found there will be a proper investigation fernandes said
of the people on board the airbus a three hundred and twenty two hundred one hundred and fifty five are indonesian three are south korean one is british one is french one is malaysian and one is singaporean the airline said
eighteen children including one infant are among the passengers the carrier said
seven of the people on board are crew members
families of airasia flight passengers given support through the nightmare 
flight eight thousand five hundred and one was requesting deviation due to en route weather before communication with the aircraft was lost the airline said
the flight's captain asked permission to climb to a higher altitude the indonesian transportation ministry's acting director general for air transportation affairs djoko murdjatmojo said according to the national news agency
according to flight tracking websites almost the entire flight path of the plane was over the sea
cnn aviation analyst mary schiavo said that if there was an onboard emergency the pilots should have issued a mayday call or a pan pan call
mayday means you're immediately in danger of losing the flight
pan pan means that it is urgent but that you can continue the flight and request an alternate route or an alternate airport said schiavo a former inspector general for the u.s. department of transportation
it's disconcerting in that the standard procedures for an emergency don't seem to have been deployed she said
but alan diehl a former air force and ntsb accident investigator said pilots don't always make mayday calls in an emergency
you know that the controllers can't really help you he told cnn
you and your co pilot are going to have to solve this
it's too soon to know what happened to the missing plane he said
details released so far show some similarities diehl said with an air algerie flight that disintegrated and crashed in july after changing its flight path because of bad weather
but there's also a chance that the airasia flight didn't crash after losing contact with air traffic control he said
the airbus a three hundred and twenty is equipped with a ditching switch diehl said that essentially turns the plane's fuselage into a boat
if they got the aircraft down on the water safely he said it should be floating
as word spread of the missing plane the airline changed the color of its logo on its website and social media accounts from red to gray
indonesia's president joko widodo said his nation was praying for the safety of those on board
pope francis also prayed for the missing according to vatican radio
airasia is a malaysia based airline that is popular in the region as a budget carrier
it travels to about one hundred destinations with affiliate companies in several asian countries
the missing plane is operated by airasia's indonesian affiliate in which the malaysian company holds a forty eight point nine percents stake according to its website
airasia has a very good reputation for safety cnn aviation correspondent richard quest said
flight eight thousand five hundred and one's captain has a total of twenty thousand five hundred and thirty seven flying hours with six thousand one hundred of them with airasia indonesia on the airbus a three hundred and twenty the airline said
the first officer has a total of two thousand two hundred and seventy five flying hours airasia said
the plane's last scheduled maintenance was on november sixteen it said
the french foreign ministry said the first officer is the french citizen who is on the plane
a state run company in indonesia that manages airports identified the first officer as remi emmanuel plesel
airbus said the plane had accumulated approximately twenty three thousand flight hours in some thirteen thousand six hundred flights
the aircraft manufacturer said it would provide full assistance to authorities in charge of investigating the missing plane
the loss of contact with the airasia plane comes nearly ten months after the disappearance of malaysia airlines flight three hundred and seventy which dropped off radar over southeast asia on march eight with two hundred and thirty nine people on board
the malaysia airlines plane a boeing seven hundred and seventy seven two hundred er lost contact with air traffic control over the south china sea between malaysia and vietnam
searchers have yet to find any debris from flight three hundred and seventy which officials believe crashed in the southern indian ocean after veering dramatically off course
but some aviation experts don't think the search for flight eight thousand five hundred and one will be as grueling as the search for mh three hundred and seventy
we are not talking about the deep indian ocean here quest said
we are talking about congested airspace around southeast asia
there will be much better radar coverage
there's certainly better air traffic control coverage

ireland's high court ruled friday that doctors can withdraw the artificial breathing support as there is no reasonable prospect her unborn child will survive
the twenty six year old woman was pronounced clinically dead on december three after suffering serious brain trauma
prior to the high court ruling doctors had refused to turn off the machine providing artificial breathing support out of concern for the rights of the unborn child
under ireland's constitution the unborn have the same right to life as the mother
abortion is illegal except in cases where the mother's life is at real and substantial risk due to medical complications or the threat of suicide
the court said in its ruling that this was a tragic and unfortunate case and that medical experts showed no medical or ethical basis to continue with a process described as verging on the grotesque
the woman had two children ages six and four years and was engaged
ireland's pro life campaign also called the case tragic but said the court proceedings were necessary
while it is very difficult for the families concerned that cases like this sometimes end up in court the fact is that it is a sign of a healthy democracy that life and death issues are taken seriously and appropriately determined the group's ruth cullen said in the statement

the syrian government is ready to send envoys to moscow for talks with representatives of the opposition it has been fighting in a brutal civil war for over three years according to state run media
the government of president bashar al assad wants to find a way out of the conflict in the country state news agency sana said saturday
but moderate opposition groups say they have not been invited to the talks by russia and will not participate according to oubai shahbandar with the syrian national coalition the main opposition group recognized by the united states the united nations and russia
he said moscow invited only loyalists groups that are close to the syrian regime
the meeting is expected to take place after january twenty in moscow and will be informal russian foreign ministry spokesman alexander lukashevich said earlier this week according to russian state news agency itar tass
negotiators have been named
they are the foreign minister and the first deputy
but it is up to syria's authorities to decide on the format for the delegation to be sent for moscow's consultative meeting the spokesman said
the syrian national coalition says any meaningful talks must be held on the basis of the geneva communique that was agreed upon by the united states united nations and russia
negotiations in geneva brokered by the united nations fell apart in february
at the time u.n. mediator lakhdar brahimi apologized to the syrian people saying he was very very sorry that despite two rounds of talks we haven't done very much
since then the extremist group isis has become a growing force in northern syria and al qaeda linked al nusra front has made gains weakening more moderate opposition groups
u.s. options in syria shrivel as islamists gain

neighborhoods turned into islands surrounded by a sea of murky brown water
streets doubling as rivers
cars swept away and toppled over
the flooding has forced more than one hundred and thirty two thousand people to evacuate malaysia's official bernama news agency said
strong currents and interrupted power supply are adding to the chaos prime minister datuk seri najib tun razak told reporters
clean water supply too can not be delivered and flood victims at the temporary relief centers had to endure darkness without electric supply he said according to bernama
the flooding ravaging malaysia started more than a week ago
while the region is accustomed to monsoons the northeast monsoon that has gripped malaysia indonesia and southern thailand is particularly harsh
here's how it works cnn meteorologist derek van dam said saturday
strong high pressure develops over eastern europe and china and strengthens northeasterly winds from the south china sea bringing heavier rainfall over malaysia indonesia and southern thailand
and it's going to get worse
another one hundred millimeters of rain could fall over the next two days near the malaysia thailand border he said
that leaves open all kinds of possibilities more flooding and the possibility of landslides and mudslides van dam said
across the bay of bengal sri lanka has been hit hard too
kandy in the center of the island nation received more than twice the average monthly rainfall in just the past eight days van dam said


the north korean government is fuming over the release of the the interview claiming president barack obama forced the film into theaters and onto streaming video services
u.s. president obama is the chief culprit who forced the sony pictures entertainment to indiscriminately distribute the movie and took the lead in appeasing and blackmailing cinema houses and theatres in the u.s. mainland to distribute the movie north korea's national defense commission said saturday according to state run media
obama always goes reckless in words and deeds like a monkey in a tropical forest
in the screwball comedy a tabloid journalist who is granted an interview with north korean ruler kim jong un is asked to assassinate him
but when he arrives the movie version of the dictator charms him
later on however the two wage battle
just getting the interview into theaters and online streams has been an ordeal
sony pictures had initially suspended the christmas release of the movie after its it systems were hacked by a group called the guardians of peace which had complained about the movie's pending release
the group also warned of severe attacks on movie theaters showing the film
in the cyberattack thieves took a possible record haul of one hundred terabytes of data a slew of movies and other content company secrets personal information of employees and the social security numbers of celebrities
the fbi has blamed north korea for that cyberattack
north korea in turn slammed the united states for the accusation
if the u.s. is to persistently insist that the hacking attack was made by the dprk the u.s. should produce evidence without fail though belatedly said the north korean defense commission statement carried saturday by the state run korean central news agency
if the u.s. persists in american style arrogant high handed and gangster like arbitrary practices despite the repeated warnings of the dprk the u.s. should bear in mind that its failed political affairs will face inescapable deadly blows
pyongyang's statement also accused the united states of being behind the crippling outage of north korea's internet last week
the u.s. a big country started disturbing the internet operation of major media of the dprk it said
the u.s. government last week declined to say whether it was responsible for the internet disruption in north korea
obama had earlier warned the united states would respond proportionally to the sony hack
obama had also expressed disappointment at the movie's suspension saying free speech had been stifled
we can not have a society in which some dictators someplace can start imposing censorship here in the united states because if somebody is able to intimidate us out of releasing a satirical movie imagine what they start doing once they see a documentary that they don't like or news reports that they don't like obama said last week
that's not who we are
that's not what america is about
the fbi has said that the code of the malware used in the attack on sony is similar to what north korea has used in other attacks
but that code was leaked a long time ago cyberexperts say and any hacker around the world could have used it
some u.s. cyberexperts say the evidence the fbi has presented isn't enough to isolate north korea as the culprit
it's clear to us based on both forensic and other evidence we've collected that unequivocally they are not responsible for orchestrating or initiating the attack on sony said sam glines who runs cybersecurity company norse
cnn has reached out to the fbi for comment on such doubt but has not heard back
after sony pictures said film distributors had decided not to show the interview for security reasons sony then arranged for direct distribution online via its own services youtube and through independent cinemas
a few hundred movie theaters decided to go ahead and show the film on christmas
sony had originally planned to release the movie in two thousand to three thousand theaters but only about three hundred played it
nonetheless the film raked in one million dollar on its first day
while there were threats of attacks on theaters that showed the film no major incidents were reported

another hollywood movie is running afoul of a foreign government this month
exodus
gods and kings was banned in egypt
the ministry of culture bans the film gods and kings for historical inaccuracies the egyptian agency said in a statement
the movie which stars christian bale as moses is a re enactment of the biblical story of the jews escape from slavery in egypt more than three thousand years ago during the time of the pharaohs
australian actor joel hedgerton plays the pharaoh ramses in the twenty th century fox production
it shows history from a zionist viewpoint and forges historical events therefore it is was banned in egypt according to state news agency egynews
in one thousand nine hundred and fifty six the same biblical story was told in the ten commandments starring charlton heston as moses and yul brynner as ramses
that version was filmed on location in egypt
exodus is the latest in hollywood's string of religious themed movies released this year
in march several muslim countries banned the blockbuster noah saying the depiction of noah whom muslims revere as a prophet is forbidden in islam
news of the ban comes on the heels of the limited release of the interview the movie that provoked north korea to vow merciless action against the united states over its lampooning of leader kim jong un
on saturday north korea called u.s. president barack obama the chief culprit who forced sony to indiscriminately distribute the picture

zakariya ismail ahmed hersi al shabaab's intelligence chief was captured in a house near the town of el wak somali military commander isack hussein mursal told state run radio
he was a close associate of former al shabaab leader ahmed abdi godane who was killed in a u.s. airstrike near barawe city in september
somali forces captured hersi and his driver without confrontation officials said
the u.s. state department had issued a three million dollar reward for information leading to his capture
zakariya has told us following his capture that he left al shabaab a year and half ago and since then was looking for to surrender to the somali government col. abas ibrahim gurey a senior military official told cnn
the capture comes after militants with the group which is linked to al qaeda attacked a large african union base in mogadishu on thursday killing three ugandan soldiers and a civilian
al shabaab has said that attack was revenge for the u.s. airstrike that killed godane
the state department had offered a seven million dollar reward for information on godane's location

the girl was presented before the media wednesday to describe what she called her forced role in the deadly attack
her father she said joined boko haram and took his wife and daughter to a village in the forest in bauchi state in northern nigeria
my father took us to the bush which was surrounded by gunmen she said according to a cnn translation
i was asked if i wanted to go to heaven
when i answered they said i have to go for a suicide mission and if i attempted to run they would kill me
the girl and two others were taken by boko haram militants to nigeria's second most populous city kano and were dressed with explosives laden devices
the other girls set off hidden bombs that day killing four people police said
one of the girls said one of us should enter the market first the girl told reporters
she said we should separate when we entered the market
the girl described how one attacker said the third girl would set off her bomb first then the remaining two would detonate their explosives
i said no
i said i would not detonate the girl said
she was wounded by one of the explosions
the teen escaped in a rickshaw that she took to a former home in kano the girl said
neighbors saw her and made her go to a hospital
she left the explosive device in the cart but the driver and hospital officials recognized the device and alerted authorities
the girl told police she was forced into being a part of the attack
what to know about boko haram
cnn has not independently verified the girl's story
police presented her to the media without her parents or a lawyer present
officials wanted to make clear the attack was the work of boko haram
we want to disabuse the minds of members of the public

this is not a tribal war
it's a terrorism act like we have had in the past kano state police commissioner adenerele shinabad said
boko haram has terrorized northern nigeria regularly since two thousand and nine attacking police schools churches and civilians and bombing government buildings
violence has increased sharply in recent months just ahead of nigeria's february elections
the group has targeted mainstream islam saying that it does not represent the interests of nigeria's eighty million muslims and that it perverts islam
in april boko haram militants drew international condemnation when they kidnapped more than two hundred schoolgirls many of whom they said they sold into slavery
at least five thousand people have died at boko haram's hands according to a u.s. congressional research service report making it one of the world's deadliest terrorist organizations
why outrage alone will not defeat boko haram and bringbackourgirls




a missing priest in violence plagued guerrero state was found dead in an alley on christmas day his diocese said
the rev
gregorio lopez gorostieta who was forced out of his truck and kidnapped by unidentified men days before had been shot in the head according to the diocese of altamirano
we are tired of pain and delinquency injustice and corruption said bishop maximino martinez miranda
we want the incidents to be clarified as well as the death of so many people in guerrero state
we live in a moment of violence
no suspects or motives are known
there is a moment when priests come out to reclaim justice for the people and that perhaps does not please everyone the bishop said
there are many hypotheses
we are leaving this in the hands of the corresponding authorities
guerrero is drug cartel territory
ciudad altamirano is about a two hour drive from iguala the city where forty three students from a rural teachers college went missing three months ago
authorities believe the students were taken by police in iguala and turned over to gang members
the gang members killed the students burned the bodies and dumped some of them them in a river authorities allege
lopez is the second priest from the diocese found dead since september
father ascension acuna osorio whose body was found floating in a river had been serving in a church an hour's drive from the cathedral altamirano
authorities are still investigating his death according to the diocese
on christmas eve the night before lopez's body was found and his death announced by the diocese fellow priests had held a protest against the violence and called for his release
they carried signs that read ya basta

ireland's high court ruled friday doctors can withdraw life support in the case of a clinically dead woman who is eighteen weeks pregnant as there is no reasonable prospect her unborn child will survive
the court earlier this week heard the woman's family had appealed for her treatment to be stopped saying they wanted her to die with dignity
however doctors refused to turn off the life support machine as they were concerned about the rights of the unborn child
under the irish constitution the unborn have the same right to life as the mother
abortion is illegal except in cases where the mother's life is at real and substantial risk due to medical complications or the threat of suicide
the woman in her twenty s with two other children was put on life support on december three when she was pronounced clinically dead after suffering serious brain trauma
a panel of three high court judges ruled friday the life support can be withdrawn
they found the medical evidence in the case shows the prospects for a successful delivery of a live baby are virtually nonexistent
justice nicholas kearns announced the decision
he said
to maintain and continue the present somatic support for the mother would deprive her of dignity in death
it would subject her father her partner and her young children to unimaginable distress in a futile exercise which commenced only because of fears held by medical specialists of potential legal consequences
kearns continued
highly experienced medical practitioners with the best interests of both mother and unborn child in mind do not believe there is any medical or ethically based reason for continuing with a process described as verging on the grotesque
the court is therefore satisfied in the circumstances of this case that in the best interest of the unborn child it should authorise at the discretion of the medical team the withdrawal of ongoing somatic support being provided for in this tragic and unfortunate case
lawyers representing the unborn child said they would not lodge an appeal

editor's note
fareed zakaria is the host of cnn's global public square
this column was adapted from moonshots a gps special airing at ten a.m. and one p.m
et sunday on cnn
the views expressed are his own
moonshots are exciting inspiring
but they are also expensive and not all of them work out like apollo eleven
so are they worth it 
should we focus time money and energy on these kinds of ambitious scientific projects 
the answer is yes
think of it this way
imagine that the apollo moon landing had not succeeded
would it still have been worth it 
almost certainly
after all the challenge of getting to the moon and back meant coming up with all kinds of technological innovations and solutions that have then had almost miraculous commercial applications
for example apollo needed small computers for its trip
so nasa says it made a big purchase of a relatively new technology the integrated circuit the technology behind what we now know as the microchip
the companies that pioneered this product firms such as fairchild semiconductor whose alumni founded intel partly had nasa to thank the agency says for the popularity of the technology that followed
the u.s. government by buying the initial products helped the computer revolution take off
and it's not just the microchip
gps technology which is now powering the next phase of the information revolution was originally developed by the u.s. military
but it was only after the one thousand nine hundred and eighty three soviet shooting down of a korean air lines flight that the reagan administration said it would share the technology so that civilian airplanes would not wander into restricted and dangerous territories
and it was only after the cold war ended that the clinton administration opened up the technology fully to commercial applications which of course unleashed a flood of innovation that continues to this day
or consider the mapping of the human genome
according to the battelle memorial institute the federal government spent three point eight billion dollar on the massive project from one thousand nine hundred and ninety to two thousand and three an amount few other entities could ever have afforded
but in leading the way it encouraged others and now a person's dna can be sequenced for as little as one thousand dollar
the impact on the economy of human genome sequencing from one thousand nine hundred and eighty eight to two thousand and ten was estimated by battelle at almost eight hundred billion dollar enough to support more than three hundred and ten thousand jobs in two thousand and ten alone
reading all this you might think the united states is on the right track
alas the problem is it is not
federal funding for research and development has barely been keeping up with inflation in recent years if you look at the numbers from the national science foundation
since big entitlements such as social security are mandatory spending programs it is discretionary spending such as science that often bears the brunt of the budget ax
and this cutting comes at a time when others around the world are moving fast
the united states has dominated the world of basic science for years even decades
but recently its share of global research and development has been falling from thirty seven percents of the total in two thousand and one to thirty percents in two thousand and eleven according to the national science foundation
as scientist neal lane points out china is on course to surpass the united states in the percentage of its gross domestic product it spends on research and development in just a few years
it used to be that funding basic science was not a partisan issue
as lane notes a certain rock ribbed republican was a big proponent of basic research
reagan said in a one thousand nine hundred and eighty eight radio address
the remarkable thing is that although basic research does not begin with a particular practical goal when you look at the results over the years it ends up being one of the most practical things government does
this is why i've urged congress to devote more money to research
it is an indispensable investment in america's future
americans used to understand that moonshots inspire us but that they also power america's future
let's hope that today's politicians follow reagan's advice and invest in science research and development

army led joint operations have been scaled up in all troubled districts of the state including kokrahar and sonitpur where bodo extremists carried out a series of deadly attacks on other tribal communities earlier this week newton said
meantime federal authorities have despatched five thousand additional armed police to assam according to state inspector general s.n
singh
at least seventy two people were killed in the assault by bodo militants on tuesday singh said
separately three people died when police fired at violent mobs trying to storm a police station in sonitpur district on wednesday singh told cnn
on thursday indian home minister rajnath singh termed the militant strike in assam a massacre as he vowed to pursue what he called a time bound action against terror
he also ruled out talks with outfits indulging in cold blooded murder according to a home ministry statement
as part of anti insurgent efforts in assam india said it was also reaching out to its eastern neighbors for assistance
india's seven northeastern states are wedged between china bhutan myanmar and bangladesh and reports have emerged that bodo militants might be hiding out beyond indian territory
sushma swaraj india's external affairs minister already has contacted the bhutanese leadership at the highest level spokesman syed akbaruddin told reporters in new delhi
we are also working on having contacts with others who could possibly help us in this matter
once that is completed i will share those details with you akbaruddin said
india's impoverished northeast region where assam is located has a high concentration of extremist groups from different backgrounds with conflicting ethnic and political interests
members of the bodo tribe an indigenous group have fought for decades for political autonomy
they also have long standing tensions with muslim settlers in assam
but on tuesday they attacked members of non assamese tribal people who have lived in the state since before india got independence in one thousand nine hundred and forty seven inspector general s.n

the second struck at uzbek hideouts in the mangroti area killing three according to the sources
a similar strike saturday in north waziristan's datakhel region killed five militants intelligence sources told cnn at the time
the strikes come amid an offensive by pakistan's army in north waziristan aimed at clearing out taliban and other militants in the region
tens of thousands of people have been displaced


british prime minister winston churchill concurred calling it undoubtedly the greatest american battle of the war
so it was entirely appropriate the man widely considered the world's best war photographer robert capa was embedded with u.s. troops during a portion of the battle
capa's photos in the accompanying gallery were taken in just a short time at the end of december one thousand nine hundred and forty four according to cynthia young curator of the international center for photography's capa archive
young said while capa drew acclaim for his action photos those he took at the battle of the bulge are of a different nature
the images of dead soldiers a farmer burying a dead horse in the snow and german prisoners corralled with their hands raised attest to the bleakness of this deadly campaign young said
capa who young describes as decidedly anti fascist was not an impartial observer of the war but rather an official allied photographer
he photographed for the american and english press to inform readers of the war in the hope that his photographs would help garner allied support young said
you'll see several photos of german prisoners in the accompanying gallery
young said that capa would only photograph german soldiers if they were prisoners
despite capa's allied status he cast anything but a military appearance according to kenneth koyen a u.s. army public relations officer who assisted capa during the battle of the bulge
writing in the history of photography koyen relates how that appearance almost cost capa his freedom when koyen escorted capa into a u.s. army intelligence headquarters where an intelligence officer lt. col. harry brown was working on a wall mounted map of battle positions
arrest that man
get him out of here 
brown shouted as he tried to conceal the map from capa who was wearing a pilfered german fur coat according to koyen's account
koyen was able to convince the colonel of capa's allegiance but the photographer's appearance almost cost him again later in the battle when u.s. soldiers began shooting at capa koyen wrote
koyen stepped in and waved the gis off he wrote
and then
capa and i exchanged a long glance
without a word he took off the fur coat and stowed it in the
those gis were among the one million soldiers who fought in the battle of the bulge
more than one hundred thousand germans and sixty seven thousand americans were casualties according to the national ww ii museum
the battle was considered finished on january twenty eight one thousand nine hundred and forty five when german forces were pushed back to positions they occupied when their offensive began six weeks earlier
learn more about capa at the international center for photography's capa at one hundred page which includes the only known recording of capa's voice a radio interview from one thousand nine hundred and forty seven
robert capa was a hungarian photojournalist known for his photographs covering five wars
he died on assignment in one thousand nine hundred and fifty four


disrupted playstation and xbox networks frustrated gamers much of friday one day after going down on one of the busiest gaming days of the year
neither sony or microsoft which own playstation and xbox respectively have had much to say about the outages that have kept millions of its gamers from playing one another online but there were signs friday evening that it may soon be resolved
at two sixteen a.m friday microsoft's verified xboxsupport account tweeted some xbox one users may currently be experiencing issues signing into xbox live and directed users to its service website for the latest
sony's official playstation support twitter account posted at two thirty a.m
et our engineers are continuing to work hard to resolve the network issues users have experienced today
thanks for your continued patience
more than fourteen hours later at five ten p.m it tweeted pretty much the same thing
update
we are working to restore full network services for all platforms thanks as always for your patience
but based on the overall sentiment expressed in the comments posted to message boards and on twitter the collective patience among playstation users is offline as well
askplaystation has been tweeting that for hours now since last night user christopha seven hundred and ten posted on sony's playstation four support forum
i'm getting rid of this piece of trash and going back too sic pc gaming
totally not cool allenjaelee said late friday morning
i've tried so many times and am unable to play
some users talked of a possible hack
this is so frustrating wrote calin seventy five
the hackers think they're hurting sony but the ones that really pay for this bull crap are the innocent users
if it turns out that this was indeed a cyberattack chances are it was done by lizard squad a band of black hat hackers who have claimed responsibility
cnn can not confirm the identity or claims of the group and playstation hasn't said anything beyond that it was working to fix the problem
for its part xbox spokesman sean mccarthy told cnn that we don't share info on the root cause of specific issues
but there is little reason to doubt their claims
in august lizard squad said it took down the playstation network by flooding it with illegitimate traffic something called a distributed denial of service attack in the video game world resulting in millions of gamers being unable to play together online
as cnnmoney reported at the time when john smedley president of sony online entertainment tweeted about those large scale attacks he became a target himself even at thirty thousand feet
we have been receiving reports that smedley's plane three hundred and sixty two from dfw to san has explosives on board please look into this the group tweeted to american airlines resulting in the flight being diverted
earlier this month sony was hit with a similar outage that lizard squad not only took credit for but it promised additional christmas presents would soon be coming
unlike santa we don't like giving all of our christmas presents out on one day
this entire month will be entertaining lizard squad tweeted
at six thirteen p.m. friday a lizard squad twitter handle tweeted all attacks on psn and xbox have stopped
when a cnn reporter hit refresh moments later on the sony entertainment network website which had been down since thursday evening it was back online
microsoft's service page was still reporting limited service however
the network downtime started just hours after microsoft's xbox video store started to stream the seth rogen comedy the interview
the movie was made by sony pictures a sibling of sony's playstation division
sony was the victim of a massive cyberattack in late november that was widely believed to be motivated at least in part by north korea's anger over the interview which depicts the assassination of the country's leader kim jong un
but there was no indication that thursday's problems were in any way connected to the movie's digital release
other participating distributors of the movie such as youtube were unaffected
and playstation is not participating in the release
a sony pictures spokesman deferred to playstation for comment about the outage

vladimir putin delivered a lump of coal in the kremlin's stocking this year when he announced thursday that he has canceled holiday vacations for members of the government
russia's president delivered the bad news at a december twenty five meeting he convened of his government but for those thinking that his timing was merely the diabolical twist of a maniacal scrooge christmas is celebrated in russia on january seven the traditional date in the eastern orthodox church
the government and its various structures can not afford such extensive holidays at least not this year putin told government ministers in a speech broadcast on state television
you know what i am talking about
he was talking about russia's battered economy
we have been making efforts to change the structure of our economy to refine it and make it more innovative
quite a lot has been done in this direction he said
however recent events show that this is not enough
it was a change in tone from just a week ago when putin largely blamed the west for russia's woes even suggesting a u.s. saudi conspiracy theory to bring down oil prices at his annual press conference
at thursday's meeting however the president admitted at least some fault
the difficulties we have come across are not only of an external type
they are not only due to some sanctions or limitations caused by the global market situation they are also the result of our own shortcomings that have piled up over the years

so now people will go to the movie when it opens christmas day in the u.s. and then perhaps everyone can judge the merits of this massive incident but let's take a moment to speak for the only subgroup not represented in the viral debate
the film is about journalists yes 
ok let's see what this might do for to journalists then
sony chairman michael lynton said this about the film to cnn
first of all we made the movie because it was because we thought it was a funny comedy
secondly there is a long history of political satire in film
and this clearly falls into that realm
and michael who had run penguin books after the one thousand nine hundred and eighty's salman rushdie affair when iranian ayatollahs condemned rushdie to death for writing the satanic verses admitted that sony's originally pulling the interview from theaters was a blow to freedom of expression which is uniquely dear and protected under the u.s. constitution
and after declaring pyongyang was in fact behind the massive attack president barack obama weighed in about setting a dangerous precedent
we can not have a society in which some dictators someplace can start imposing censorship here in the united states obama said
imagine what they start doing once they see a documentary that they don't like or news reports that they don't like
absolutely right
and that's where we journalists come in
because after all the sturm und drang about process corporate profits legal liabilities constitutional rights letting terrorists set the agenda let's talk a little about content
let's in fact spare a thought for our subset diligently working away out there in the united states and around the world
david carr media writer for the new york times said this about the film's content
while i am all for bold creative choices was it really important that the head being blown up in a comedy about bungling assassins be that of an actual sitting ruler of a sovereign state 
if you want to satirize a lawless leader there are plenty of ways to skin that cat as charlie chaplin demonstrated with the great dictator which skewered hitler in everything but name
yes and 
what about those bungling assassins
they're journalists right 
or meant to be 
and what message will that send to every whacked out dictator from another planet paranoid control freak thug posing as president 
not to mention crazy extremist throat slitting militant terrorists 
i don't want to spoil the discussion party about satire comedy freedom of expression etc
but i can tell you from personal experience the above mentioned already think we are velvet revolutionaries at best or cia agents military spies
and yes would be assassins
one of the most appalling acts of journo murder was the killing of legendary afghan freedom fighter ahmad shah massoud just days before nine eleven
imagine two terrorists posing as journalist and cameraman get the interview
they are in fact wired up suicide bombers
no one thought to check them and the rest is history
in iran thirty five journalists are in jail on specious charges including iranian american jason rezaian of the washington post
his mother told me the family has heard that a closed trial condemned him on espionage related charges
it's nonsense of course but this is what journalists have to endure
the iranian government seems to believe all these people are regime change agents through cultural subversion
they are terrified of a so called velvet revolution and color revolutions ever since they put down the green movement after the disputed two thousand and nine elections
journalists were swept up in a dragnet forced to confess on iranian state tv before being tried and sentenced to the infamous evin prison
check out jon stewart's excellent debut movie rosewater on the case of british iranian journalist maziar bahari
it's a sobering saga of the ridiculous kafkaesque dark reality of what it takes to be a journalist in iran and other countries
in russia offending journalists not to mention anyone who vaguely looks sideways at putin can feel the wrath of the system
some are arrested some worse
anyone remember reporter anna politkovskaya shot point blank in her moscow apartment building in two thousand and six 
a staunch critic of the kremlin and author of putin's russia she was working on a series of reports about human rights abuses in chechnya at the time of her death
and by the way facebook this week caved in to the russian government's demand that a site for opposition politician alexei navalny be taken down
he's under house arrest
huh 
i didn't hear a peep of sony rage about this serious damage to freedom of expression
terrible year for journalists in the middle east
over the years in these and many other countries the number of journalists killed injured arrested and just plain shut up has soared and continues its horrible upward trajectory
finally this year spare a thought for the victims of the madmen of today's middle east
journalists james foley and steven sotloff aid workers alan henning and peter kassig were trussed up in guantanamo colors and forced to kneel before their throats were slit so wide their heads came off
before their execution they were forced to denigrate their families and their flags
they were forced to admit to false charges of spying and plotting
they were forced to give up their very dignity before they were forced to give up their lives
as i say the interview might be very funny
i just wish it weren't yet more fodder for the deluded who see all journalists as their mortal enemy
we haven't mentioned what north korea does to offending journalists
their own prisoners get labor camps torture and starvation rations if they're not executed
foreigners get traded for a whole load of publicity and who knows what else
but i bet journalist lisa ling is probably pleased her sister's prison ordeal there began and ended before this film was released
and furthermore i can assure you our colleagues who have been so brutally killed and imprisoned this year and every year were certainly not the easily distracted members of the american press who choose gossip type that west wing and newsroom creator aaron sorkin railed against in his sony rage last week
the wishes of the terrorists were fulfilled in part by easily distracted members of the american press who chose gossip and schadenfreude fueled reporting over a story with immeasurable consequences for the public a story that was developing right in front of their eyes sorkin said in a statement
no the ones we lost this year were brilliant brave and full of heart daring to keep doing the dangerous job of bringing you the truth
may they rest in peace

tiger woods says it is an incredible relief to be over his injury problems and is now concentrating on adding to his fourteen major titles next year
woods who turns thirty nine on december thirty failed to make the cut at the u.s. pga in august after struggling to retain full fitness following surgery on a pinched nerve in his back earlier in the year
the u.s. star made a return to action earlier in december at the hero world challenge the tournament he hosts every year at his home course of isleworth in florida
but the former world number one was unable to finish after being physically ill during his third round leaving him joint last
writing on his end of year blog woods said
i'm mostly excited about being healthy again
i've struggled for the past year and half with my back and it showed in my results
even though i won five times two years ago it was hit or miss some weeks and got progressively worse
now that it feels healthy strong and stable it's fun to be able to play with my kids again to play soccer and run around with them shoot hoops
things that i used to do and took for granted
for anybody who has ever had a bad back with nerve damage it's downright debilitating
to not feel that is finally just incredible relief
woods who won the last of his major titles in two thousand and eight will spend the holiday season with his children and partner lindsey vonn
ski star vonn who missed out on equaling the all time record for the number of world cup race wins last weekend has had injury problems of her own
vonn was forced to undergo knee surgery earlier this year and missed out on defending her olympic downhill crown at the sochi olympics
speaking to cnn earlier this year vonn revealed how woods had played a key role in helping her through a difficult time when he too was struggling for fitness
tiger and i both went through rehab with our injuries at a similar time so we were both in the gym together and pushing each other and motivating each other both frustrated vonn told cnn's alpine edge last month
i think we both helped each other a lot through that time and i drew a lot of inspiration from him and i think he does the same with me
we continue to push each other and it's a really positive relationship in that way

some call makoko the venice of africa
but while the intricate waterways may replicate the layout of the picturesque italian city living conditions could hardly be more contrasting
makeshift houses with corrugated iron roofs balance precariously atop stilts
down below narrow wooden boats act as a form of aquatic taxi ferrying goods and people around the bustling community
nobody knows the exact population of this slum district of lagos but it is estimated to be as high as one hundred thousand
what's sure is that few tourists will come here to take a romantic gondola trip beneath the night sky moonlight bouncing off the water onto informal shacks
there is little by the way of a sewer system meaning all sorts of pungent smells are sure to puncture the nostrils
on top of that law enforcement agencies rarely enter the slum with security left to groups of young men known locally as the area boys
for photographer sulayman afose however the muddy waters of makoko have always been home
the aspiring twenty four year old was born raised and continues to live in this chaotic floating district
as such it is one of the subjects he feels most comfortable turning his ever more popular lens on
i started my photography here in makoko afose told cnn when we meet at the plush surrounds of the two thousand and fourteen lagos photo festival
it's really inspiring
i've been able to get a lot of inspiration in terms of seeing a lot of things in my community he added
afose's career has really begun to take off in recent years
after learning his craft in workshops put on by the african artists foundation he went on to study photojournalism at the nigerian institute of journalism
he's since had photos exhibited at various national arts and photography festivals as well as appearing in numerous international magazines and publications
afose has even worked alongside the respected spanish photographer cristina de middel
happy to see some of my work published he said
and to see the fact of my name written on the pictures is something very great
yet despite the international recognition its the daily hustle and bustle of makoko that continues to inspire afose
he explains that his knowledge of the local customs attitudes and the people who live there gives him an edge over those who may come from outside to document life in the community
to tell the story with this you have to know who this guy is
just by looking at him is he happy or is he not happy 
you have to try to know what it is all about
you can't just pick up your camera and start shooting he said
here and now
then there's the skill vital for any photojournalist to develop the handy knack of being in the right place at the right time
afose was rapidly on the spot when a fire that tore through part of makoko in two thousand and thirteen
the scenes were horrific but the images afose captured told the story and brought some of the harsh realities of life in the slum to the outside world
they appeared in numerous publications in print and online
the fire was caused by a generator and it burned a lot of houses in the community afose explained
i had the opportunity to get there at the right time and try document what the scene was all about what caused the scene what caused the fire outbreak he added
it is likely the makoko fire wouldn't have garnered as much attention in the national and international press without afose's timely and grabbing images
the experience has made him even more aware of the importance of having local people tell the story of the community there
so much so that it has inspired him on to his next challenge
i want to go further i want to know more he said
when pushed on what this means he added you know maybe having a university degree come back to the community and teach people
to become what i am today
maybe then the outside world will be able to appreciate even more of life in makoko through the sharp shooting eyes of its residents

professional travel reviewers are like prickly old movie critics once they've done enough traveling dining and lodging they can become weary and entitled taking for granted the joys that accompany nightly turn down service or unlimited bread sticks

almost one thousand seven hundred years and counting on when and how to celebrate christmas
if at all
we're not talking the grinch here

in the early centuries of christianity's existence there was no consensus on the date of jesus birth or even on whether the day whatever it was should be celebrated as a holiday
elesha coffman writing in christianity today notes that early christians contended that the date was variously may twenty april eighteen april nineteen may twenty eight january two november seventeen november twenty march twelve and march twenty five and that december twenty five probably didn't emerge as the favored date until late in the third century
that intentionally or not grafted the new christmas onto the old saturnalia the most popular celebration of roman times
the seven day festival that started december seventeen to honor the god saturn and welcome the winter solstice gave us today's tradition of holiday greenery gift giving and the office party for the saturnalia was a time of much drinking some carousing certainly unrestrained revelry
the yin and yang of that has come down to us through the centuries and can be seen today in the battles over the commercialization of christmas the popularity of yuletide parties too many martinis oiling the voices raised in song
a little too much god rest ye merry gentlemen and not enough o holy night
having enjoyed wonderfully merry and happy christmases through the years as i was growing up and making my way in the world i took those concerns in stride and kept ho
ho
ho
at the ready
then in my early forty s when i was living in new england while leafing through a book as part of my research for a story i hit the subtopic
christmas under the ban
because it happened to be facing a page with an old fashioned illustration of a little girl standing under a living room archway trimmed with greenery i thought the rope of greens was the ban
complaints about how to celebrate christmas had started early threaded through the dark ages the middle ages and then came into their own in tudor england
christmas in merrie olde england was seen by the puritans as a bit too merry
the holiday had come to be marked by bearbaiting beer and ale and other spirits flowing in the taverns on christmas eve rowdy crowds celebrating the lord of misrule
come christmas morning minstrel like parades would march down the aisles in churches where services were being held
unable to rein in the excesses the puritans turned their back on christmas altogether
not just the celebrations and traditions christmas day itself
it would be just another day
their no christmas policy no way no how spelled n e v e r crossed the atlantic with them on the mayflower
when the pilgrims landed at plymouth in december one thousand six hundred and twenty they observed the sabbath on sunday but come christmas day went ashore to work
back in england when the puritans came to power under cromwell a proclamation was issued in one thousand six hundred and fifty two decreeing that stores should remain open on december twenty five
in new england such a law was formally on the books in boston duly enacted by the legislature of the massachusetts bay colony on may eleven one thousand six hundred and fifty nine and not repealed until one thousand six hundred and eighty one
but christmas had its appeal
the rev
increase mather felt it necessary to address its evils in one thousand six hundred and eighty seven
the generality of christmas keepers observe that festival after such a manner as is highly dishonourable to the name of christ
how few are there comparatively that spend those holidays after an holy manner
but they are consumed in compotations in interludes in playing at cards in revellings in excess of wine in mad mirth
will christ the holy son of god be pleased with such services 
in one thousand seven hundred and eleven the rev
cotton mather like father like son railed against the holiday merriment
i hear of a number of young people of both sexes he wrote belonging many of them to my flock who have had on the christmasnight this last week a frolick a reveling feast and ball which discovers their corruption and has a tendency to corrupt them yet more
it wasn't just the mathers in their pulpits keeping a watchful eye out for signs of christmas
judge samuel sewall who kept a diary that has given historians a rare look at daily life in boston in the eighteen th century has numerous diary entries expressing his elation at the sight of people going about their regular daily business on christmas day equally disdainful of any signs of awareness or recognition much less celebration of christmas
a one thousand six hundred and ninety seven entry
decemb twenty five
ninety seven
snowy day
shops are open and carts and sleds come to town with wood and fagots as formerly save what abatement may be allowed on account of the weather
the puritans were so vigilant watchful for the slightest sign of keeping christmas because they saw any breach as the first step toward falling back under the domination of the church of england from which they'd fled
and anyone who kept christmas became an outcast literally or figuratively
the tide started to turn in the late eighteen th century
the first waves of immigration to lap at the new england shores like the flood tide that would come in the nineteen th century tended to be from countries that observed christmas
not to be underestimated in its importance to the holiday the ratification of the u.s. constitution removed the fear of falling back under the heel of the church of england when it decreed no establishment of a state religion in fact proclaimed a separation of church and state
but the puritan hold on new england was strong
as late as one thousand eight hundred and fifty six december twenty five was a common workday in boston and those who refused to go to work on christmas day were often dismissed
some factory owners would even change the starting hours on christmas day to five a.m. workers who wanted to attend church services would either have to forgo them or be dismissed for being late to work
opinion
where christmas really came from
henry wadsworth longfellow wrote in a journal entry dated december twenty five one thousand eight hundred and fifty six
not a very merry christmas
we are in a transition state about christmas here in new england
the old puritan feeling prevents it from being a cheerful hearty holiday though every year makes it more so
across the pond charles dickens a christmas carol published december nineteen one thousand eight hundred and forty three was reconciling the centuries old war over christmas the two sides clearly shown battle lines drawn in the opening pages when scrooge's nephew drops by
don't be cross uncle
said the nephew
what else can i be returned the uncle when i live in such a world of fools as this 
merry christmas
out upon merry christmas

if i could work my will said scrooge indignantly every idiot who goes about with merry christmas on his lips should be boiled with his own pudding and buried with a stake of holly through his heart
he should
nephew returned the uncle sternly keep christmas in your own way and let me keep it in mine
keep it
repeated scrooge's nephew
but you don't keep it
that of course was before the visits from the ghosts of christmas past present and yet to come that wrought the one hundred and eighty degree turn in scrooge that with the help of the cratchits and tiny tim gave us the christmas we know and love today
but pockets of resistance lingered in boston
in the early one thousand nine hundred s a bride from virginia where christmas was celebrated married a man from boston where it was touch and go and they settled into a place on beacon hill
as christmas drew nigh she asked around for a group that went caroling and found there was none
thinking to start one she found a problem
as the folks put it when they declined
someone might hear us
as late as the one thousand nine hundred and thirty s some churches in boston would be closed a printed notice on the doors saying there would be no services christmas day
today the old puritan concerns have been reduced to occasional outbursts about the commercialization of christmas and the liquid aspect of the good cheer
while the old carols and the newer songs by such songwriters as irving berlin can be heard in malls large and small mingling with the ringing of the bells at the salvation army collection kettles or on the radio
if white christmas is the best known of the newer songs the one that conveys how much christmas has come to mean to us may be the one that came out soon after when millions of world war ii servicemen were still overseas i'll be home for christmas
the lyrics added to the poignancy
you can plan on me
please have snow and mistletoe
and presents on the tree
remember it's a wonderful life ends when george bailey's brother who has been away in the service returns home christmas eve joining the family and friends around the christmas tree in time to hear the bell ring when clarence the gentle angel gets his wings

seema tomar has worked hard for her shot at fame
from humble beginnings in rural india the thirty one year old has stared down the barrel of poverty and prejudice to become one of the world's leading trap shooters
tomar made history in two thousand and ten when she became the first indian woman to win a world cup medal and has collected dozens of trap shooting prizes over the years
two golds at the asian shotgun championships held in the united arab emirates last month were the latest landmarks in tomar's glittering shooting career which began in the decidedly less sparkly surroundings of johri a provincial village fifty km north of new delhi
with around five thousand five hundred inhabitants and a local economy based around agriculture villagers have been more used to wielding scythes than shotguns and air pistols but tomar's fortunes and others were transformed when a shooting range was set up in the late one thousand nine hundred and ninety s
from the beginning i was always interested in sports but there were no facilities in the village tomar told cnn's human to hero series
but then a local doctor who used to work in new delhi came and built a small shooting range
the johri rifle club is a modest affair with a ten meter range and a handful of shooting bays
there's also limited electricity so practice can only take place during the day
but these meager facilities have changed lives says tomar
when people got to know that a shooting range has opened in the village families realized that rather than the kids roaming free in the village they could get involved in this activity
it had a huge effect she says
along with producing a string of champion shooters the range has also given villagers access to careers outside farming with many finding work with the indian army and local police forces
for tomar though the prospects of joining their number initially looked bleak she was approaching adulthood and expected to get married and become a housewife
i spoke to my mother and father asking them if i could do shooting
looking at the culture and society of the village they said it is not possible
it hurt me a lot and i felt really bad tomar said
i realized that until the time someone from my family most likely an elder would go into shooting my family would not let me enter the sport
so when her mother had a go attitudes towards the teenage tomar's participation changed
my mother was sixty years old when she started shooting and participated in air pistol and air rifle
she won medals at state level then she played pre nationals and nationals and won medals there too
like her mother prakashi tomar stared out using an air pistol but soon switched to a bigger weapon
i in air rifle for two years and my score was good
three hundred and ninety four hundred
but i thought i needed some other event she said
when i saw the shotgun event for the first time i liked it
it was a very explosive event
my results was quite good in it and i won a lot of medals
tomar enrolled in the indian army in two thousand and four and has been on india's shooting team since two thousand and five winning thirty two gold medals at national level and five golds and one silver on the international stage
her speciality trap shooting involves hitting a series of moving targets from a distance of around seventy five meters using a twelve bore shotgun
when tomar clinched her historic silver medal at the world cup in two thousand and ten she scored a personal best seventy out of seventy five a mark she bettered by two points at the recent asian shotgun championships during the women's team event
the physical aspects of her sport are tiring there is a lot of recoil in the gun she says but to shoot well requires a clear mind as much as a steady hand
the most important is mental relaxation she says
the best thing is music
i love listening to music
before every match i listen to a good song and keep murmuring it
that is the best way to let go of all my mental stress
whenever i miss the target or i get under pressure then i say no let's sing a song 
that song keeps playing in my head
the benefit of the song playing in my head is that i leave the pressure and the match becomes better because of it she laughs
with her mother still enjoying her shooting well into her seventy s tomar could be around at the top of her sport for decades to come
but for now the crosshairs are on some important targets just around the corner like qualifying for the rio olympics in two thousand and sixteen
with a maximum of thirty places available for each competing country and two people per event tomar will need to be at the top of her game next season when the quota places are earned at world cup events and world and continental championships
medals and titles are clearly important to tomar but so are the triumphs of equality she has helped foster through her success promoting a message to girls in her village and across india that they too can be the masters of their own destiny
i remember my older times when i would come to this shooting range nervous and shy
i used to think will i be able to do anything will people ever get to know me 
all those things of the past i remember
now i feel really good and people know that and if girls are coming here for shooting they have achieved something
i love the feeling that many girls have come out of their house

american traveler stacey addison says she was detained for months in east timor because she unwittingly shared a taxi with a stranger carrying methamphetamine
now she's out of jail and a guest of a former east timor leader
addison forty one of oregon was released from an east timor prison thursday nearly four months after her initial arrest in the small southeast asian nation in a drug case in which she says she's innocent
addison appeared before reporters thursday at the home of former east timorese president and nobel peace prize laureate jose ramos horta who says he'll host her temporarily at his home
details on the reasons and conditions for her release or when she would be able to leave the country weren't available
she couldn't leave immediately thursday because her passport seized during the investigation had not been returned
the u.s. state department welcomed the decision according to department spokesperson jen psaki but confirmed that addison remains in timor leste where the government still retains her passport
both she and ramos horta said they would not discuss details of the case
addison was asked what she would do when she is able to obtain a passport
her answer
go home
i don't think my mom would ever forgive me if i didn't come home immediately and stay for a while she said
addison's arrest in september was an unexpected bump in what had been a multi year trip around the world
she said she had been traveling solo since january two thousand and thirteen having quit her job as a veterinarian to explore the globe
on september five she was sharing a cab from near the indonesian border to the east timor capital of dili
on the way a fellow passenger asked to stop to pick up a package at a dhl office her mother bernadette kero of oregon has told cnn
after the man picked up the package police surrounded the car and arrested the occupants according to kero
the package was found to contain methamphetamine addison has said
she initially was held for four nights and a judge released her but prevented her from leaving the country while the case was still being investigated after the man testified that he didn't know her kero said
in late october during a court appearance where she thought she'd retrieve her passport a judge ordered her arrest again and sent her to gleno prison outside dili
paul remedios a lawyer representing addison said at the time that the court detained her again because there was a warrant for her arrest and that the reason for the warrant was unclear
addison said thursday that she had petitioned for her release earlier this month but didn't expect to be released on thursday
i had kind of thought it wouldn't happen because it's christmas that everything would be closed she said
i knew there was a petition pending but it had been three weeks and i had heard nothing
kero told cnn last month that the case was a nightmare
on thursday she said her daughter's release was the best christmas present i could imagine
the past four months have been an extremely stressful time for all of us kero wrote in an email thursday
of course we are now hoping that her passport will be returned and she will be able to return home to oregon very soon
her lawyer will work on getting her passport released
i just want to be able to see her and give her a big hug

pope francis wants to bring hope to christians and other ethnic and religious groups suffering brutal persecution in iraq and syria
the pope used his christmas day blessing urbi et orbi to draw attention to displaced children and adults in the middle east who for too long now have suffered the effects of ongoing conflict he said in a reference to the syrian civil war and increased instability in iraq with the rise of isis
the pontiff appealed for compassion for refugees so that all who now are suffering may receive the necessary humanitarian help to overcome the rigors of winter
tens of thousands gathered thursday in st. peter's square in vatican city to hear the pontiff's blessing which is customarily global in nature
urbi et orbi is latin meaning to the city and to the world
the message comes a day after francis delivered his second midnight mass as pope
the pope has used his influence as the spiritual leader of all catholics around the world to affect political outcomes this year
he played a key role in a historic breakthrough in u.s. cuba relations this month and urged religious tolerance during a visit to turkey in november
his blessing thursday included hope for peaceful resolutions of other conflicts around the world
he prayed for reconciliation in ukraine and for peace in nigeria where islamic militants are killing and kidnapping people in the northern part of the african country
may christ the savior give peace to nigeria where more blood is being shed and too many people are unjustly deprived of their possessions held as hostages or killed he said
he also noted other african countries dealing with a rise in islamic militant attacks and those fighting the ebola crisis
truly there are so many tears this christmas he said
making a special appeal on behalf of youth he said may jesus save the vast numbers of children who are victims of violence made objects of trade and trafficking or forced to become soldiers
the pope also addressed last week's school massacre in pakistan in which taliban militants gunned down students
may the power of christ which brings freedom and service be felt in so many hearts afflicted by war persecution and slavery he said
francis called on christians to embrace their faith and reject selfishness
may this divine power by its meekness take away the hardness of heart of so many men and women immersed in worldliness and indifference

bao bao did a no no and the shock sent her scrambling up a tree
the giant panda cub at the smithsonian's national zoo in washington d.c. touched a hot wire in her yard part of a warning system used by the zoo to show animals their boundaries the zoo said
the shocking experience sent bao bao up a tree tuesday afternoon
the sixteen month old cub climbed to a limb where she felt safe and was still perched there on wednesday visible on the zoo's livestream cam
after the gentle shock zookeepers gave the cub's mother mei xiang access to the outdoor yard and she spent the night keeping an eye on bao bao a likely scenario for a mother panda to stay with her cub in the wild the zoo said on its facebook page
a zookeeper also spent the night in the panda house just in case they decided to come inside the zoo said
the jolt is a part of life for growing animals in the zoo
this is a safe warning system used by zoos for containment the national zoo said
bao bao is perfectly fine and like all zoo animals she is still learning the boundaries of her habitat
many people commented about the event on the zoo's facebook page
what amazed me is the deep concern of mei xiang pacing throughout the yard and sleeping near her little one in the night rain barely eating inside today persistently pacing the yard and checking on bb
her bond with and care for bb is quintessential momma bear
hope her anxiety and restlessness can be alleviated soon heather s. sonntag wrote
wrote chris nielsen berg
sounds like life with teenagers who test the limits stay out all night and cause their parents no end of worry
the zoo reassured the world that the cub will return to the ground sooner or later
the staff are adjusting the pandas routine today and are confident that bao bao will come down when she is ready the zoo said
the cub's name means precious treasure in mandarin

in two thousand and seven when the london property market was booming and former headhunter kristian jeffrey was between jobs he received an interesting request
i was asked to put ads on the pavement in front of estate agents offices he said
advertising was something he'd started thinking about in his already budding entrepreneurial streak
gumtree the uk equivalent of craigslist the free online classifieds where viewers can buy and sell almost anything wanted to do a clean advertising campaign in seven uk cities
the goal was to get consumers to advertise directly through gumtree instead of going through a real estate agent
the ads were literally cleaned onto dirty pavement at target locations
it was cheeky a bit more edgy than the normal campaign said jeffrey
i'm not sure they appreciated it
the campaign went extremely well sales of homes advertised directly on gumtree went up by eight hundred percents he said

what happened next was an explosion of media attention
one thing led to another and he found himself doing campaigns for ing bank in the netherlands and belgium among others
jeffrey says those jobs let him grow his street advertising services a company focusing on outdoor advertising campaigns including three d street art street graffiti and grass advertising
one of its best known campaigns was the world's biggest shave a giant roger federer face spray painted on a hill in wimbledon for gillette
the business has grown swiftly and this year jeffrey decided he needed to hire an experienced sales director and also move his midlands based company to a bigger office to house his dozen employees
before doing this
i wanted to make sure we had the money in the bank explained jeffrey
local banks didn't seem to grasp his business plan he said
so in august he put his company on funding circle the largest peer to peer business lender in the united kingdom applied for forty thousand watched investors bid and within days he had his loan
it has a nine percents interest rate he says as opposed to the commercial banks who wanted to charge ten thirteen percents

how to make eight million dollar on kickstarter
there are many different models of peer to peer lending but essentially p two p websites let businesses borrow money directly from individuals without going through a traditional financial institution such as a bank
funding circle has five thousand five hundred businesses registered and has lent more than three hundred million since it started
the company is projecting massive growth
while banks still provide the majority of lending in the united kingdom over eighty five percents funding circle is confident it can seize a big percentage of that
we look to take a large chunk of that over the next five to ten years said natasha jones a company spokeswoman
funding circle says the p two p business lending industry is tripling in size every year and has the potential to be worth over twelve billion a year in the united kingdom in the next ten years according to research by nesta a charity focused on innovative businesses and ideas
lending club and prosper are the two largest p two p lenders in the united states with a majority of the market
they issued two point four billion dollar in loans in two thousand and thirteen up significantly from eight hundred and seventy one million dollar in two thousand and twelve
what's more a recent report by venture capital firm foundation capital predicts the global market for p two p lending could be worth over one dollar trillion by two thousand and twenty five
different p two p websites advertise different levels of returns but funding circle said whether it's a small one off investment minimum ) or a large investment from a savvy lender the net return on average is about six point four percents after fees and bad debt are accounted for
bad debt is a hazard of this kind of lending as is the possibility that the p two p website itself will go bust but the industry is becoming increasingly regulated and p two p services include various risk mitigation systems
there is a risk
it's an investment product not a savings product said jones
despite this many investors want to lend locally or support a particular industry or an ethical business and can do this easily in the p two p model she said
for another creative company it was a matter of cash flow and not being paid on time which prompted it to look at another p two p lender marketinvoice
this online marketplace allows businesses to auction their invoices to investors who bid to provide capital against the as yet unpaid earnings
london based cada design group an interior and graphic design company for the food and beverage industry said it turned to marketinvoice in two thousand and twelve as a way to get finance against its design invoices
we've always looked at various forms of funding apart from conventional banking
but unfortunately in the design business because we're not doing anything tangible our services are time and ideas said ashley smith financial director for cada design
marketinvoice was the first company that came up with a viable option and said you can sell your invoices and release that cash very very quickly said smith
cada design whose client list is long and includes major uk brands pret a manger boots and marks and spencer as well as dean and deluca gourmet food shop in the united states said facing late payments from clients in its business could be catastrophic
people still don't pay their bills on time but it has given us an avenue to remove that stress said smith
it's our painkiller

after an eventful twelve plus months that began with him being named time's person of the year and ended with his blistering critique of the vatican bureaucracy pope francis got a chance to celebrate on wednesday by presiding over christmas eve mass at st. peter's basilica
the mass typically one of the biggest events on the roman catholic calendar was attended by eight thousand people inside the basilica while another three thousand followed along on screens set up in st. peter's square
this year a drone outside and various three d cameras inside recorded the mass
pope francis personally requested a performance of mozart's mass in c minor for the service according to a vatican spokesman
israeli soprano chen reiss sang et incarnatus est from the mozart composition
on the vatican radio website pope francis said that et incarnatus est is unbeatable and brings you to god
manfred honeck music director of the pittsburgh symphony orchestra conducted the orchestra of the accademia di santa cecilia in rome
it is the second christmas mass since francis born jorge mario bergoglio became pontiff
during his homily the pope said that though time has been marked by hatred oppression violence and wars god was there all along waiting
through the course of history the light that shatters the darkness reveals to us that god is father and that his patient fidelity is stronger than darkness and corruption
this is the message of christmas night he said according to an english translation of his remarks
since becoming pope francis has stayed busy and remained an extremely popular respected figure worldwide
in recent months for instance he urged religious tolerance during a visit to turkey and played a key role in a historic breakthrough in u.s. cuba relations
his conversational tone warm demeanor and rapport with children and others have continued to win francis admirers
but he has also garnered critics including among catholic conservatives for his positions such as a push to make the church more welcoming for gays and lesbians and his proposed solution for divorced and remarried catholics who want to receive communion
despite his high position francis hasn't always been successful
bishops ended a tense two week summit in rome in october without agreeing for instance on how to minister to gays and lesbians
such pushback hasn't stopped the pope's efforts to change the church however
in his annual christmas address monday to the vatican bureaucracy the curia he criticized its members illnesses ranging from the disease of feeling immortal to vainglory and excessive planning
dear brothers such diseases and such temptations are naturally a danger for each christian and for each curia the pope said

we have to cure ourselves of these
bishops will be held accountable for not protecting youths

olympic chiefs have pledged to arrest fears that sailors and windsurfers at the next games will not just have to deal with their rivals on the water but a potential super bug under it
researchers have found a bacteria more typically encountered in hospital waste which produces the enzyme kpc in several different locations along the carioca river which feeds guanabara bay where the sailing events will take place
the bacteria is resistant to antibiotics and can cause urinary gastrointestinal and pulmonary infections although rio officials are adamant the risk is minimal
but the international olympic committee insisted it had been made aware of the problem and was working closely with rio officials to minimize any potential risks
the ioc statement sent to cnn read
the health and safety of the athletes is our number one priority
rio has created a task force to monitor this situation and we are being kept fully updated by them
we will continue to work with rio to ensure that the athletes are able to compete safely and in the best conditions possible
the research is the work of the oswaldo cruz foundation considered one of the world's main public health research institutions
study coordinator ana paula d'alincourt carvalho assef of the foundation said in an email to the associated press
there is a risk of contracting diseases which are not more serious than those caused by other microorganisms
the problem is that in case of infection it is possible that treatment involves hospitalization
since the super bacteria are resistant to most modern medications doctors need to rely on drugs that are rarely used because they are toxic to the organism
earlier this year biologist mario moscatelli described the marina gloria which will serve as a base for the sailing competitions as a toilet
while rio mayor eduardo paes admits a planned clean up will not be completed prior to the games state officials have allayed fears over the risk to sailing competitors that take to the water
in a lengthy statement from the state environmental institute forwarded to cnn it said
according to the president of the institute isaura frega the bacterium is not very resistant in the environment especially in salt water
there's no need to panic
the possibility of discovering this bacteria in our beaches is minimal almost non existent assured isaura frega highlighting that there are no records of people contaminated with the bacteria outside of the hospital environment being admitted to rio de janeiro's public hospitals
kpc is a bacteria which loses its potency when it comes into contact with salt water
it's not an aggressive bacteria
it's only resistant to antibiotics
it only represents a risk to those people who have a weak immune system explained the specialist
as for rio two thousand and sixteen organizers they have been in contact both with the government and also the oswaldo cruz foundation
a spokesman for rio two thousand and sixteen told cnn
we were alerted to a possible presence of kpc type bacteria in some parts of the carioca river
rio two thousand and sixteen created a task force regarding this matter
the group will continue to monitor the matter very closely and discuss with the government and with specialists the solutions to prevent contamination of the water and continue to guarantee the safety of athletes
this issue does not impose any change in our planning for the test events and competition events

for decades he made an impressive career out of freediving with great white sharks
the south african daredevil survived numerous encounters with these ocean predators
and when he needed to get closer to the animals taking the cage out of cage diving was a risk the pioneering diver was willing to take
but a debilitating stroke three years ago tragically left the ex fisherman unable to get close to the sharks he came to love
today the closest he can get is through the tours of a local shark diving firm supreme sharks where he provides his expert knowledge for eager tourists
it's been eleven years since i last swam with a shark and i've love to get back into it again at a later stage hartman says
i'm not ready yet but i'm sure once i can swim properly i'll be there again
this passionate pioneer of the oceans has spent years studying what many believe is one of the most dangerous predators in the world
i'm just mesmerized by how they move and what they do and that fascinates me
they're like an aeroplane they fly in the water
those wings flex with the weight of the body
born in bellville cape town hartman has been a bit of thrillseeker ever since he was a child
by his teens he could often be found with his friends trying to catch snakes with their bare hands
following graduation the young risk taker drifted from various jobs
finally after serving his mandatory national service in the army hartman found spearfishing
the ancient and rather arduous tradition of spearfishing has been used for millennia across the globe
it has also become a competitive sport and hartman soon became one of the country's top spearfishers
then one day in one thousand nine hundred and seventy seven during a seemingly normal practice dive hartman would have a close encounter that would change his life forever
he'd been diving for a few hours and was reeling in his line when a sharp movement flicked past him
thinking it was a shoal of fish he tried to move around it and was confronted with a big black eye
it was a white shark my first white shark and i thought wow wait until i tell my friends he recalls
first white shark and it's huge
looks like a house next to me
once the initial shock and awe of the situation wore off hartman started to tussle with the large predator pushing back as the shark came in a little too close for comfort
when he bit down on the gun i was paralyzed from shock
i didn't expect it
and then it reopened its mouth and i saw my hands go in
i thought uh oh and i jumped back to life and jerked it out of his mouth
i put my fist on his eye meaning to gorge his eye out and he just spat the gun out and dived down and swam away
after this dramatic confrontation hartman laid still for five minutes recalling how he swore he would never dive again
but the decision didn't last too long
he adds
the next morning a buddy calls hey are we going to dive some cray fishes this afternoon 
i said yeah that's a good idea 
in the late eighty s hartman began to see business opportunities from the big blue sea
shark tourism was booming and cage diving was quickly becoming a popular way of getting up close with the great whites off the coast
by one thousand nine hundred and ninety seven the savvy entrepreneur had started his own company taking eager adventurers to sea and lowering them gently beneath the waves to meet the sharks at close range
within months the business began to take off and filmmakers came knocking at his door
the budding entrepreneur had found his niche
i became the guy if you want to film sharks go to andre
within two years they needed shots they couldn't get so i said jump in the water and we'll get it
because when you're in the cage with a camera it shakes so i started taking people out of the cage
over the years hartman's reputation as one of south africa's leading shark experts has brought big opportunities and even the chance to join a film shoot in mexico
but then things took a turn for the worst
when i came back i actually had a stroke on my right hand side which paralyzed me completely
refusing to let his stroke become a setback he began to fight back recovering quickly
but then three years ago hartman suffered another stroke this time it was too much and left him unable to swim with the sea creatures he loves
at the moment i'm just really starting to walk
but i still fall down every now and then
but i mean that happens he says
i've just got to get stronger
i'm walking short steps and it's going slowly
i mean the way i've lived my life if i have to do it again i'll do it exactly the same
watch the full show to find out more about hartman's exciting experiences of freediving with great white sharks

countless christmas songs tell us that santa is basically the judge judy of juveniles
he decides who's been naughty or nice and doles out presents or punishments accordingly
but historians say kris kringle was originally created to keep adults not children off the naughty list
being crafty codgers we ducked santa's surveillance turning the spotlight on kids and dramatically changing christmas celebrations
how did we achieve this very important historical victory 
picture this
it's the early one thousand eight hundred s and america's christian leaders most of whom were protestant reformation types had banned religious celebrations of christmas as unscriptural and paganish
but people still wanted to party
because why not 
it was midwinter the crops were harvested and sailors were waiting for better weather to disembark
so on december twenty five working class stiffs got fall down drunk and stumbled around cities looking for stuff to loot
imagine black friday spring break and new year's eve then smash them together like sumo wrestlers full of saki
that was christmas in the early one thousand eight hundred s
a bunch of blue blood new yorkers decided all this fun must stop
they wanted to domesticate christmas bring it indoors and focus it on children says gerry bowler author of santa claus
a history and professor of history at the university of manitoba in canada
these grinches who formed the saint nicholas society of new york would change the world with two little poems
yep
poems
but let's back up for a minute
when the dutch came to the new world in the one thousand six hundred s they brought a fellow from folklore named sinterklaas with them bowler says
sinterklaas who wore a red bishop's miter and a snowy white beard was based on st. nicholas a three rd century greek who lived in modern day turkey
despite being a bishop this nick was a bit of a bad boy
an archaeologist who dug up his bones in two thousand and five found that nicholas had a broken nose perhaps a result of the persistent persecution of christians around that time said adam c. english author of the saint who would be santa claus
or could it have been christian on christian violence 
according to one medieval legend nicholas punched a heretic in the nose at the council of nicea the meeting in three hundred and twenty five that formed the first consensus on christian doctrine
early icons of nicholas depict him without bishop's garb a subtle suggestion that he had been demoted possibly for fisticuffs
alas the nick at nicea rumor is not true said english
but people seem to love the story which pops up like poinsettias on the internet this time of year
thankfully st. nicholas was known for more than brawling
he also had a reputation for giving gifts and protecting children
the first quality comes from a story about a poor man with three young daughters
without a dowry to offer suitors the man worried that his daughters would fall into prostitution
legend has it that nicholas dropped three bags of gold through an open window in the man's house saving the women from the streets
the second story is a bit macabre
while staying at an inn nicholas discovered three dismembered children in pickle barrels
he reassembled and resurrected the briny kids and punished the guilty innkeeper
these deeds along with his everyman persona made nicholas the greatest male saint of the middle ages said bowler
one measure of his popularity is the looong list of people places churches and christian groups that list st. nick as their patron
bowler santa's biographer says that st. nick's feast day december six was celebrated across europe for hundreds of years often by giving gifts to children
but beginning in the one thousand five hundred s the protestant reformation swept away the cult of christian saints denouncing them as unbiblical and idolatrous
christmas too went pretty much by the wayside for much of protestant europe during this time
some countries though such as the netherlands kept alive traditions associated with sinterklaas
and it was these customs that nineteen th century new yorkers wanted to revive
as they sought to make christmas more family friendly the saint nicholas society found the perfect front man in their namesake who after all was known for being nice to children
it was a genius move
the real goal was getting drunks off the street remember 
now they could do that by turning christmas into a family event when children who had it pretty rough back then would receive gifts for good behavior
but the knickerbockers needed more than good cheer to change christmas
they needed stories
drawing on the dutch legends about sinterklaas the american author washington irving wrote a series of sketches featuring st. nicholas soaring high above new york houses smoking a pipe and delivering presents to well behaved children
about a decade later in one thousand eight hundred and twenty one an anonymous poem called the children's friend featured a magical figure called santeclaus who drove a reindeer led sleigh full of rewards and filled obedient children's stockings with little presents
building on that an episcopalian scholar named clement clarke moore wrote a poem for his big brood called a visit from st. nicholas
it's now better known as the night before christmas
strangely for a seminary professor moore's poem strips st. nick of religious rhyme and reasons
nicholas wears a fur suit clambers down chimneys and gives presents to good children
but he says nothing about the reason for the season as contemporary christmas warriors like to say
still moore's st. nick story went viral spreading across the northeastern united states faster than reindeer on ritalin
in some early depictions santa claus looks like an overgrown elf
in others he looks kind of scary as american artists merged st. nicholas with european traditions such as the german krampus who punishes bad children
by the early one thousand nine hundred s bowler says santa became standardized as the white bearded red suited twinkle eyed benevolent grandfather that we all know and love
and we're not the only ones
merchants seized on this guy right away bowler says
they immediately saw the possibility that this personification could be useful in their selling
in other words santa was pitching products almost as soon as he hitched up his sleigh
but before you blame kris kringle for commercializing christmas think back to what it was like before he came to town when kids and many adults really had something to pout about


but greenfield's success follows tremendous adversity
as a teenager he survived two horrific years in concentration camps during the holocaust and lost his parents and siblings at the hands of the nazis
in this excerpt from his memoir measure of a man greenfield describes how an encounter with an ss guard at auschwitz led him to pick up a needle and thread for the first time and how tragedy taught him the power of clothes
martin greenfield
it was our second day inside auschwitz
the soldiers asked if we knew any trades like masonry carpentry medicinethat kind of thing
dad grabbed my wrist and thrust it into the air
he is a mechanic
very skilled he said
above the gates at auschwitz was a sign
it read arbeit macht frei
by volunteering my skills as a mechanic my father protected me
it was his way of marking me for the germans as a jew whose skills they could exploit as one not to be burned
as soon as my father offered up my skills two germans walked toward us to take me away
i then did something i should not have done something stupid
i ran
why i do not know
fences and soldiers were everywhere
where did i think i was going 
i can not say
but for whatever reason i ran
a few paces into my sprint i heard a barking german shepherd barreling down on me
my arms pumped hard as i stretched my stride and ran faster than i'd ever run before
the barks got louder
i snapped my head back over my shoulder and saw the dog closing in
he leapt and latched his teeth onto my leg
i looked down
the dog hung from my calf
i shoved his head with both hands
he snarled and gnashed violently as i struggled to pry him loose
the dog's jaw unlocked taking a meaty chunk with him
blood spurted on my prisoner uniform the dog's moutheverywhere
i tried not to cry
not in front of my father not in front of the other men and boys
the two soldiers tromped over to retrieve the dog and make sure he was uninjured
they then snatched me up off the ground and hauled me away from the group
i thought maybe that night i would join my father again but that did not happen
that day my second inside auschwitz was the last time i ever saw my father
the germans dragged me to the laundry
whether they wanted me first to perform a simpler task than mechanical work or whether this was a punishment for trying to flee i do not know
but after my sprinting stunt i was eager to show the germans i was a hard worker who could be of use
my first job in the camps was washing nazi uniforms
i knew nothing of the task
still i grabbed a brush and an ss soldier's shirt and scrubbed hard and fast
after working my way about halfway through the pile it happened
i scrubbed so hard the bristles ripped the collar
the face of the pacing soldier at my station flushed red
i do not remember his words but i remember his baton
he beat me until i bled
he needed to make an example out of me for the other prisoners
when he was finished with my flogging he balled up the torn shirt and threw it in my face before huffing off
the shirt was trash to the soldier but not to me
i kept it
working in the laundry was a nice man who knew how to sew
he gave me a needle and thread and taught me how to sew a simple stitch
i mended the shirt
to this day i still don't know why but when i got up the courage i slipped the soldier's shirt on and wore it under my striped prisoner uniform
it was a crazy thing to do because none of the other prisoners had a shirt
but i did it anyhow
from that day on the soldiers treated me a little bit better
they thought i was somebodysomeone who mattered someone not to be killed
the prisoners treated me a little bit better as well
you must remember that some of the kapos were jewish prisoners but they could be brutal
they wanted to please the germans so some of them would be hard on us so the germans would not punish them
sometimes the kapos were harsher than some of the germans
when i had my soldier shirt on however that did not happen
when i wore the shirt the kapos didn't mess with me
the shirt means something i thought
and so i wore the shirt
in fact i ripped another one on purpose so i could have two
the day i first wore that shirt was the day i learned clothes possess power
clothes don't just make the man they can save the man
they did for me
of course receiving your first tailoring lesson inside a nazi concentration camp was hardly the ideal apprenticeship
i would have much preferred to hone my craft on savile row or in the mills of milan
looking back though that moment in the camps marked the beginning of the rest of my life
strangely enough two ripped nazi shirts helped this jew build america's most famous and successful custom suit company
martin greenfield's memoir measure of a man is available now



sulayman khalid twenty from regent's park in western sydney appeared in parramatta local court wednesday after having been arrested at his home the previous day police said
he was refused bail and is scheduled to reappear in court on february eighteen court staff said
the maximum sentence he faces is fifteen years police said
a second man a twenty one year old from the sydney suburb of marsfield was also charged by counter terrorism police with breaching a control order
a person can be subject to a control order if it substantially helps prevent a terrorist attack or the person has trained with a listed terrorist organization or been convicted of terror offenses according to the australian attorney general department
the charge carries a maximum sentence of two years imprisonment
australian federal police deputy commissioner michael phelan told reporters that the arrests related to activity that has been going for a while now
this group has had ongoing conversations and activity for the last year he said adding that particularly overt action had been taken on eighteen september and again last week prompting the authorities to obtain search warrants
a significant amount of material had been seized he said
while there was no specific threat of an imminent attack he told reporters
there was enough there that gave concern to us that something was being planned
the documents talked a little bit about potential government targets
the arrests came the same day that australian prime minister tony abbott warned of a heightened level of terror chatter following the martin place siege in sydney in which two people along with hostage taker man haron monis were killed
the terror threat remains high
and at this level an attack is likely abbott told reporters tuesday
we don't know when and how an attack may come but we do know that there are people with the intent and the capability to carry out further attacks
the arrests were made as part of operation appleby an ongoing investigation into islamist extremists which led to sweeping pre dawn counter terror raids in sydney in september
eleven people have been arrested in relation to the operation so far police said
phelan said operation appleby was focused on a group of fifteen to twenty people in the sydney region who sympathized with isis ideology and who had been actively monitored for some time
a police spokeswoman would not comment on claims in australian media that the target allegedly mentioned in the documents was an australian federal police building or that the documents described a plan to conduct guerrilla warfare in new south wales blue mountains
following his arrest footage appeared in australian media of khalid dressed in a jacket bearing the isis flag storming off the set of an australian current affairs show in august in which guests had been discussing local support for islamic extremism

a dozen young children chatter and giggle around me taking my pad and pen to write down their addresses very carefully
this way they tell me i'll know where to send help
but how do you tell a six year old an address no longer means anything houses and roads are gone and in too many cases so are families
it was not just the young who could not comprehend how their world changed on december twenty six two thousand and four
in hambantota on the south coast of sri lanka a parent stumbled through mangled debris in the area they assumed their house had once stood looking for lost children
siblings children cousins all looking for a sign of relatives they lost in a split second when the water came
standing in the middle of what was once the marketplace of this seaside town i looked around at a landscape that was almost flat
no buildings for miles giving a clear view of the sea that was deceptively calm and serene
only one temple was left standing the one structure built from concrete
homes were washed away with residents still inside market stalls and thousands of shoppers didn't stand a chance against the sheer force of mother nature
it is impossible to capture the extent of the devastation on camera and only those who lived through that day know its true horror
but one overwhelming memory for those who arrived afterward is the look in survivors eyes
i accompanied a u.s. doctor working for americares jonathan fine who had volunteered to help and deliver desperately needed supplies
he told me he would never forget the victims dead eyed in their hospital beds lying there staring at us wondering what their stories were how they'll ever learn to cope with this what they've seen what they've lost
and yet in the midst of the misery i witnessed in sri lanka was incredible generosity
residents who had lost everything who had seen horror beyond imagination running up to us to offer a face mask to help cope with the unmistakeable stench of death trying to give us a bottle of water
one man even apologized we were not seeing his country at its best begging me to come back when it was all over so i could experience the true beauty and hospitality of the island and its people
he then resumed the search for his brother sister and parents
the sheer scale of the disaster was difficult to overstate
one hambantota hospital that could take three hundred patients at a push saw one thousand serious injuries in the first two days alone
basic drugs many of us take for granted ran out quickly and the bottleneck of relief familiar in such disasters took time to clear
and yet rarely did i see frustrations spill over
residents helped each other and comforted each other
one textile factory had been badly damaged some of the workers were dead or missing
but rather than wait for outside help to arrive the workers cleared the building of mud debris and bodies so they could go back to work
many of the women were married to fishermen who had lost boats or were too scared to go back out on the water
without the factory their families had no income
natural disasters are cruel and brutal
there is no one to blame and little comprehension
and yet they never fail to restore my faith in human nature
strangers work together to pick themselves back up and rebuild their shattered lives
many thinking of others rather than themselves
what i witnessed in sri lanka was both heartbreaking and inspiring at the same time

a suicide bomber killed thirty eight people and wounded dozens more in a town near baghdad on wednesday police said
the attacker detonated explosives near awakening council members in al madaan a town roughly twenty kilometers southeast of baghdad as they were collecting their monthly paychecks at the council's headquarters
the awakening councils are predominantly made up of sunni arab fighters in iraq who turned against al qaeda in late two thousand and six
the u.s. backed movement is credited as being one of the main factors that contributed to a drop in violence across iraq
but council members have become targets for jihadists notably the sunni extremist group isis which has seized key areas of iraqi territory this year
the majority of the casualties in the al madaan attack were reported to be awakening council members
fifty six people were wounded in the bombing police said

the captured f sixteen pilot is moaz al kasasbeh a member of jordan's military according to his uncle retired jordanian maj. gen. fahd al kasabeh
a source in jordan's armed forces said that the pilot was downed carrying out a mission wednesday around raqqa the militant group's de facto capital in northern syria according to jordan's official petra news agency
jordan holds the terror organization and those who support it responsible for the safety of the pilot and the preservation of his life the source said
the london based syrian observatory for human rights had reported earlier wednesday that isis had shot down an unidentified warplane near raqqa a city that has been a chief target in the u.s. led military coalition's air campaign
photos purported to be of the downed pilot appeared on an isis affiliated twitter account images that fahd al kasabeh said showed his nephew
the retired general told cnn that he'd asked maj. gen. mansour s. al jabour head of the royal jordanian air force to investigate the case and take all necessary actions
the international coalition has been conducting airstrike after airstrike against isis in syria since september an effort that began weeks after first going after the group in neighboring iraq
in that period the coalition has claimed many successful hits that have damaged the militant group
but this time it's the coalition that has taken a hit
while the united states has been at the head of this coalition it's relied on a number of other countries to help militarily as well as to help legitimize the effort internationally
many nations have signed up to do so in iraq whose government is actively partnering with the coalition to target isis
but syria has been a bit more complicated
officials from the united states and elsewhere support moderate forces in syria's years long civil war trying to unseat president bashar al assad despite the fact they are both fighting against isis
some middle eastern nations however have joined the united states in going after isis in syria
jordan which borders syria iraq and israel and has a history of working with washington has been notable among them
one big question now becomes what isis does with moaz al kasasbeh now that it has him in captivity
their track record unfortunately speaks for itself
the beheadings of hostages including american journalist james foley was one of the things that spurred the united states to step up its fight against isis
those were just some of the many atrocities blamed on the sunni extremist group committed during its quest to create a caliphate which it calls the islamic state under its strict form of sharia law
isis has tried to justify its raping and enslaving of women and children not to mention mass killings of civilians as part of its campaign to purge nonbelievers
the jordanian military source cited by petra noted isis past when talking about its capture of the f sixteen pilot
it is well known that this organization does not hide their terrorist schemes the source said
and they have carried out many criminal acts of destruction and killing of innocent muslims and non muslims in syria and iraq

censorship is a part of daily life in china
news articles are erased from online search engines social media sites such as facebook and twitter are banned and cnn is routinely blacked out for chinese viewers
instagram was a huge hit in china until the government banned it during the hong kong protests
all good things must end one young chinese woman told me seemingly resigned to the fact that she can no longer post photos on instagram
while such restrictions would likely incite mass outrage in many western countries citizens in china often have no choice but to relinquish some personal freedom as the government keeps a firm grip on certain aspects of life in this booming society
china's communist party will do whatever it takes to stay in power
censorship is just one tool along with quickly quelling civil disobedience
of course china feels like a utopia of liberty when compared with the repressive north korean regime
i distinctly remember feeling a sense of freedom and relief when landing in beijing after a recent visit to pyongyang
in the democratic people's republic of korea the average citizen has never heard of the internet or social media
contact with the outside world is forbidden for all but the most elite members of this reclusive society
propaganda rules the television airwaves and fills the pages of state run newspapers
the sony hack story has received limited news coverage in china
stories have appeared on cctv's newscasts and in newspapers like china daily though with far less prominence than some other international news outlets
in shenyang on tuesday an internet search for north korea on china's leading search engine baidu dot com revealed a list of mostly positive articles about the dprk
a baidu search for north korea hack in english revealed just one nearly two week old article naming the dprk as one of several suspects in the sony hacking investigation
an identical search on unrestricted google on wednesday found more than thirty six million articles
when questioned by foreign reporters on tuesday china's ministry of foreign affairs spokeswoman hua chunying shied away from directly addressing the issue on the sony hacking probe
we need sufficient evidence before drawing any conclusion she said at a news conference adding that the united states and north korea should communicate
of course any substantive communication is unlikely given the two countries have no diplomatic ties
censorship is the reality of life behind the so called great firewall of china
the ministry of public security has been heavily censoring content for more than a decade
the chinese government acknowledges that the internet is a vital tool to support the country's rapid economic growth
chinese e commerce company alibaba transactions totaled nearly two hundred and fifty million dollar last year more than amazon and ebay combined
alibaba's overall revenue soared fifty four percents to over two point seven billion dollar in two thousand and fourteen
china e commerce transactions are expected to skyrocket to more than seven hundred billion dollar by two thousand and seventeen
but with the internet comes the risk of sharing information that the chinese government worries could destabilize the country
in china any threat to the communist party's tightly clenched grip must be controlled
it's why you're likely to find very little mention of north korea's bureau one hundred and twenty one in this nation suspected of having its own shadowy people's liberation army unit sixty one thousand three hundred and ninety eight believed to be responsible for cyberespionage
incidentally the chinese military has also denounced the united states for having its own massive cyberspying program
as all of this continues to unfold one thing is certain
international news organizations such as cnn will continue with extensive coverage
and thanks to heavy handed government censors most citizens of china will continue get only the news deemed appropriate by the government

argentina's association of professional lawyers for animal rights filed a writ of habeas corpus a resource to avoid arbitrary arrests on sandra's behalf
once the release and transfer order is issued the orangutan would be taken to a sanctuary in brazil where she would live under partial or controlled freedom
sandra who has been living in captivity for the past twenty years at the buenos aires zoo was considered a nonhuman being and she was granted basic rights such as life freedom and a premise of no harm either physically or psychologically
argentina's federal chamber of criminal cassation ruled the primate is a subject of law a nonhuman being that has certain rights and can enforce them through legal procedure according to andrs gil domnguez sandra's attorney
this is an unprecedented ruling the first ruling worldwide said the lawyer
buenos aires zoo officials did not issue a statement but will have up to two weeks to appeal the ruling
even though this is a case that sets a global precedent specialists in this matter confirmed this type of ruling only applies to cases like sandra's and great apes who share ninety six percents of their genetic identity with human beings
science considers chimpanzees gorillas and orangutans to have understanding and feelings that can be compared with those of humans
it has been proven that sandra and primates held in captivity have not only lost their freedom they have lost the ability to live in a natural habitat but it has also been proven that they are affected that they suffer from confinement and it is damage that is deep and serious said gil
some animal rights activists interpret this ruling as opening new perspectives for species in captivity
for pia pacheco from the ngo project gran simio argentina this case is a reflection of certain changes that are taking place in our country in matters related to the consideration people have towards animals and the future they may have

editor's note
raphael sperry is president of architects designers planners for social responsibility a nonprofit group that advocates for socially responsible design
he is a member of the american institute of architects and a soros justice fellow
the opinions expressed in this commentary are his
in the wake of this month's senate report graphically detailing acts of torture by the cia at guantanamo bay and elsewhere the american psychological association announced it is actively investigating collusion of its members with the torture program at guantanamo
meanwhile a decision last week by my own professional association the american institute of architects or aia suggests that impunity for all may be the order of the day
despite years of advocacy and formal requests the aia which claims as its members a majority of the roughly one hundred and ten thousand architects in the united states has officially declined to add specific language to its code of ethics that would prohibit the design of torture chambers in u.s. prisons and around the world
in doing so it cites anti trust concerns and the potential difficulty of enforcing the prohibition but it ignores the claims of human rights
to be sure the aia's ethics code contains aspirational language that broadly states members should uphold human rights in all their professional endeavors
contrast that for example with the code of the american medical association or the world medical association tokyo declaration on torture which reads the physician shall not provide any premises instruments substances or knowledge to facilitate the practice of torture
that leaves providing the premises for torture up to us architects and as far as the aia is concerned we are open for business
yes the prisons at guantanamo had architects
the design of camp six was based on the lenawee county michigan jail according to its architect
other camps were built with prefabricated steel prison cells a popular jail building technology that may well have been used to construct the cia's black site prisons overseas
the only apparent justification for the additional expense and complexity of building on such remote sites with no access to local labor or building materials was that these were places where the legal system could not interfere with indefinite detention and enhanced interrogation techniques
the aia's decision not to prohibit design for torture is not just about a handful of egregious projects however despite the horrific and planned for consequences for some of the occupants taken to those buildings
it's also about the design of spaces in more conventional prisons intended for prolonged solitary confinement
a practice roundly regarded as a form of torture by amnesty international human rights watch and the u.n. special rapporteur on torture
these organizations are but some of the human rights advocates that wrote letters urging the aia to enact a prohibition
here in the united states about twenty thousand people are held in solitary confinement in one of forty five or so specially designed supermax prisons and some sixty thousand more are held in segregation wings and security housing units in state prisons and the hole in county jails
while architects can not be held responsible for unintended uses of the spaces they design the intention of most of these spaces is clear from the get go
the use of remote controlled doors individualized cellular recreation yards and solid cell fronts with special pass through slots are all architectural features that enable and deepen isolation leading inexorably to psychological pain
half of all prison suicides happen to the approximately four percents of people in solitary confinement
architecture facilitates this suffering and these deaths
in the face of the senate's torture report citizens can by and large only watch the different branches of government contest what happened
but just as all americans are stained and put at risk by our country's reputation for torture all of us have opportunities within the multiple roles we play in life to reject torture and enact accountability
as citizens it is our responsibility to vote out torturers and to demand prosecutions of perpetrators so that torture will never happen again
likewise all licensed professionals have a responsibility to protect the health safety and welfare of the public
and for me and my fellow architects we must further protect our values by changing building codes and industry standards as new challenges emerge
the unwillingness of american's leading architectural association to prohibit the design of torture facilities is a shocking shameful and deeply troubling statement
it refuses to place any limit on the potential role of design in human rights violations even the most egregious
accountability begins at home
unless and until the aia revisits the issue american architects are represented by a professional association whose ethical boundaries include the facilitation of torture
so back to business
how far apart should those ceiling shackles be 
what dimensions did you want for that waterboard 
and of course i think it all looks best in black

south korean prosecutors are seeking an arrest warrant for the former korean air executive heather cho who sparked outrage by kicking a flight attendant off a plane for serving macadamia nuts the wrong way
the warrant would cover charges of violating aviation safety rules including a change in a flight plan assault on a plane coercion and interference in the execution of duty the seoul western district prosecutors office said wednesday
a decision will be taken on issuing of the warrant early next week after a review procedure the prosecutors office said
cho the forty year old daughter of korean air's chairman resigned from her post as vice president at the company in the aftermath of the incident earlier this month on a flight from new york's jfk airport to south korea's incheon international airport
she ordered that the plane turn back to the gate and that a flight attendant be removed because she was served nuts in a bag instead of on a plate in first class
amid public anger over her behavior she and her father both apologized for the incident
cho whose korean name is cho hyun ah said she accepted full responsibility for what happened
she wasn't available for comment wednesday
testimonies of crew members and passengers confirm that cho used violent language in a loud voice which may not be compliant with an aviation safety law that requires cooperation of passengers on a flight the ministry of land infrastructure and transport said last week
although her role put her in charge of in flight service she was only a passenger on the flight and was not flying in an official capacity
officials are also seeking an arrest warrant for another korean air executive identified by his surname of yeo on charges of ordering employees to delete an initial report of the incident the prosecutors office said
korean air said wednesday it was monitoring the situation as an arrest warrant hadn't been issued yet
the office said that prosecutors had raided the office and residence of a government official at the ministry of land infrastructure and transport who was suspected of leaking information on the investigation into the case to yeo
the captain of the plane has also faced criticism for obeying cho's demands to turn back the plane and remove the flight attendant
because of that the airline faces possible disciplinary action from the government because of the captain's failure to command and supervise crew members to ensure the safe operation of the flight the ministry said last week

fareed zakaria is the host of global public square which airs sundays at ten a.m. and one p.m

for more of zakaria's commentary visit gps or watch his upcoming moonshots special on december twenty eight
the views expressed are his own
in opposing president barack obama's opening to cuba florida's republican senator marco rubio explained this entire policy shift announced today is based on an illusion on a lie the lie and the illusion that more commerce and access to money and goods will translate to political freedom for the cuban people
rubio has correctly touched on the core issue
but theory logic and history suggest that he's wrong in his conclusions
i would recommend to rubio one of the classics of conservative thought milton friedman's capitalism and freedom
he doesn't have to spend too much time on it
the first chapter outlines the relation between economic freedom and political freedom
the point friedman makes in the book is one that america's founding fathers well understood
drawing on the political philosopher john locke they believed that the freedom to buy sell own and trade were core elements of human freedom and individual autonomy
as they expand liberty expands
this is not just theory of course
over the last two centuries the countries that embraced more commerce and access to money and goods in rubio's phrase britain america then western europe and east asia have moved toward greater prosperity but also political freedom
if you exclude oil rich countries where money is not earned but dug from the ground almost every country that has used free markets and free trade to grow is also a democracy
yes there are a few exceptions
singapore and china but on the whole there has been a remarkably strong connection between economic freedom and political freedom
in latin america itself the line has been clear
augusto pinochet's regime opened up its economy in the one thousand nine hundred and seventy s. chile began to grow but that growth then produced a stronger civil society that over time clamored for the end of the pinochet dictatorship
in latin america today democracy and markets have acted to reinforce each other transforming the continent which thirty years ago was almost entirely ruled by dictatorships to one that is today almost entirely ruled by democracies
cuba is an outlier one of the last regimes in latin america that has embraced neither markets nor ballots
the obama administration is acting on the theory that more commerce capitalism contact travel and trade will empower the people of cuba and thus give them a greater voice in their political future
and so the first point to make is that it will help cubans economically it will raise their incomes their standard of living and boost access to technology
these are all good things in and of themselves
but easing the embargo will also help americans who will benefit from being able to trade with a neighbor
this is the reason that conservatives have long understood that free trade is not a gift bestowed on someone
it helps both countries and in particular helps the united states
that's why the wall street journal's editorial page bastion of conservative thought has been an advocate on lifting the trade embargo against cuba which is a far larger step than obama's normalization
so did it support obama's opening 
of course not
it turns out that he has done it in the wrong way
it is difficult not to think that the problem here is not the policy but who the president is
had george w. bush announced this initiative i have a feeling that the wall street journal would be hailing it and rubio would be quoting milton friedman to us all

what do you do if you want to film the iconic story of phileas fogg the intrepid jules verne character who takes a bet to prove that a man can circumvent the globe in eighty days 
sure you can follow fogg's trail around the world and start shooting in different locations or you can spend most of your time in serbia
starring pierce brosnan as fogg the one thousand nine hundred and eighty nine tv adaptation of verne's around the world in eighty days was mainly filmed in and around the balkan country then part of yugoslavia
thanks to its diverse landscape and impressive architecture serbia represented a total of eighteen countries in the mini series while the city of belgrade served as the backdrop for seven world cities
serbia has a very long tradition of film making says ana ilic executive director of the serbia film commission
back in the one thousand nine hundred and seventy s and one thousand nine hundred and eighty s there were so many huge co productions that were made here
and now filmmakers are taking notice once again as serbia steps up its efforts to raise its profile as an important player in international filmmaking
from medieval castles to jagged mountains to modern cityscapes it seems that every corner and crevice in serbia can make the cut in hollywood
international hits shot at least partly in the country include the film adaptation of william shakespeare's corolianus starring ralph fiennes and gerard butler the two thousand and twelve period thriller the raven with john cusack while recently pierce brosnan returned to the country too to film spy action thriller the november man
serbia has done some really great productions in recent years says ilic
it has proven to be a really good competitive high quality service filming destination it is quite hot now
serbia's renewed focus on building an impressive reputation in international movie production is benefiting several local industry players
one of them is film producer is andjelka vlaisavljevic who is matching her movie making savvy with a meticulous approach to budgets to win more and more big budget films
she says that it wasn't always that way
they would say siberia no way we are not going there it's cold 
and so it's like no no no it's serbia 
you can you imagine what the reaction to serbia was jokes vlaisavljevic founder of work in progress productions
that's changed completely now she continues
the buzz is out that here it's not just very good crews and all that but it's a good time that you have working in belgrade
and again everybody has such a low expectations when it comes to us then they get pleasantly surprised and so they like it here
but it's not just movie producers taking advantage of serbia's bid to emerge as a key force in international filmmaking
bojan peric is a serbian actor who's found success at home and went on to appear at lockout
he says he's proud not just of his own accomplishments but of the talent and skill of the crews and production teams he works with
during all those bad times that happened in the past an industry that did not fall back was the film industry he says
that's important for the culture of the people and i believe that a country makes its image through culture

at least sixty three people have been killed in a series of attacks by tribal militants in india's remote northeastern state of assam a police official said wednesday
the attacks by fighters from the bodo tribe took place tuesday assam police inspector general s.n
singh told cnn
the bodo insurgents apparently angry over a recent police crackdown that led to several arrests and the seizure of weapons targeted members of another tribal community said khagen sarma the state police chief
india's impoverished northeast region has a high concentration of extremist groups from different backgrounds with conflicting ethnic and political interests
members of the bodo tribe an indigenous group have fought for decades for political autonomy
they also have long standing tensions with muslim settlers in assam
but in this case they attacked members of another tribal community police said
sarma didn't provide the name of the tribespeople who were targeted but called them soft targets
he said the bodo fighters used guns in the attacks
authorities have ordered a curfew in areas targeted by the extremists police said
indian home minister rajnath singh is expected to visit assam on wednesday to review the situation his spokesman k.s
dhatwalia said
dozens of people were killed in ethnic violence involving bodo tribe members and muslim migrants in two thousand and twelve
the unrest in which villages were burned down displaced hundreds of thousands of people

in the sparse hinterland of africa's southernmost nation plans are afoot to boldly take the continent where it has never gone before the deepest reaches of outer space
it's here in south africa's karoo desert that construction is scheduled to begin on the square kilometer array a cluster of three thousand satellites working in tandem over a square kilometer area
this highly sensitive collective of dishes and antennas will combine to act as a giant radio telescope the biggest in the world when built according to the ska organization probing the dark heart of space
an accompanying selection of array and aperture antennas meanwhile will provide continuous coverage of radio waves between seventy mhz and ten ghz that penetrate the earth's atmosphere
scientists hope the project will shed further light on the mysteries posed by the likes of quasars dark matter and black holes
according to phil diamond director general of the ska organisation the project could even enable scientists to pick up signals from extraterrestrials should they exist although this isn't the projects primary objective
there's also the exciting possibility of capturing information on how the universe evolved in its earliest moments
for science the prize is clearly huge
a full budget for the ska is yet to be confirmed but construction is slated to begin by two thousand and eighteen
given the scale of the project which has the backing of eleven member countries some have even dubbed the ska astronomy's version of the large hadron collider
for south africa and the wider african continent there are also many ancillary benefits
the ska an international affair is headquartered in the uk with the telescope itself planned for a dual site location in australia and south africa
distant stations will also be set up in botswana kenya madagascar mauritius mozambique namibia zambia and ghana
ska south africa is also building the meerkat radio telescope which will act as a precursor to the ska and later be integrated into the larger telescope
the construction observation and upkeep of these facilities will provide skilled jobs for local people
ska south africa project director bernie fanaroff meanwhile says that the telescope array will generate more data in a day than already exists on the entire internet
as such new computer software and programs that can pinpoint relevant data and allow humans to interact with it in a simple and time efficient manner are currently being developed
given the increasing importance of big data collection and analysis across a host of contemporary industries south africa's government is taking a calculated risk that the technologies underpinning these systems will find further commercial use both in africa and beyond
for the rainbow nation these are clearly exciting and potentially lucrative developments to be a part of
south africa wants to move away from being resource heavy economy to bring young people into science and technology explains fanaroff
building the ska
is a way of emphasizing and getting people to accept that science and tech is a key part of development
this is a point of view that dr sandile malinga head of the south african national space agency strongly concurs with
he points to successful sansa programs currently underway including the development and launch of satellites that provide data used to inform government decisions on security agriculture and environmental protection which prove the benefits of serious investment in a modern space program
the agency also gave help to nasa's mars curiosity mission during launch in two thousand and eleven
endless possibilities through innovation and new technologies which may be replicated on earth malinga says
the necessary knowledge and skills developed through such missions will open doors for our people to position themselves equally on the global space stage and even bring in external funding to our countries thus boosting the economies he adds
south africa isn't the only african nation thinking along these lines
nigeria morocco tunisia algeria and egypt have all established space and satellite programs with similar aims
ghana uganda angola ethiopia and kenya meanwhile have voiced their commitment to follow suit
some observers question whether the underlying infrastructure to enable these ambitions to flourish in the long term is currently in place
calestous juma a harvard university professor and co chair of the african union's high level panel on science technology and innovation told cnn that while it is right that african nations invest in space technology they must do so in a thoughtful and strategic manner
he points to the importance of focusing on education and inspiring future generations to become scientists and engineers to create valuable and highly skilled workforces
what we don't want is vanity space programs juma said
as it stands i think they are focusing more on the space programs and less on the education
have to be designed as a capability program otherwise the economic return will not be fully realized
while this may be the case for some african nations fanaroff says that since two thousand and five south africa has issued some six hundred grants in their human capacity development program covering everything from research chairs down to artisan training
we're putting a lot of young people through a pipeline where we're trying to take them into astronomy and physics or engineering in their first or second year of university and taking them all the way through to post doctoral fellowships
that's starting to work quite well adds fanaroff
despite his concerns about infrastructure calestous juma is enthusiastic about the broader aims of developing space programs on the continent
there are others however who say that african nations should focus more on providing for the basic needs of their populations than on the luxury of space investment
south africa has one of the largest gaps between rich and poor globally with millions living in shanty towns although earlier this year the government reported that the population living in extreme poverty has dropped by two point four million since two thousand and six
egypt has been wracked by political instability and violence since former president of thirty years hosni mubarak was forced to resign by protesters in two thousand and eleven and the subsequent overthrow in two thousand and thirteen of president mohamed morsy in a military coup
and in nigeria some regions boast the unenviable record of having sixty percents of their population living in extreme poverty
matthew sinclair from the british taxpayers alliance body was quoted by the uk's independent newspaper in two thousand and thirteen asking why his country was sending money to provide development assistance to nations like nigeria and south africa when they are investing in space technologies
if a foreign government has enough cash to invest in an ambitious space program it should not expect to be receiving cash from the uk sinclair said
the likes of malinga and fanaroff however have little time for these suggestions
this is an argument we hear often and is largely as a result of the public not being able to make the link between the benefits of space investment against addressing society's needs malinga says
africa has immense challenges with poverty hunger and access to potable water which can all be diminished through investment in space by providing valuable data that can make public policy more efficient for example
on top of this innovations that arise from the out of the box thinking that space encourages will impact on growing local economies and create opportunities for africans in the global market he adds
fanaroff however is more withering in his riposte
we don't accept that south africa has to remain on the edge of civilization
that we don't accept that's the old colonial way of thinking fanaroff says
for south africa and africa the next great economic growth story he adds
we will play a role in the future

ben was also a friend
i met him after his glory days as executive editor of the washington post
he in his emeritus years and i a galavanting foreign correspondent
i admired the heck out of him
he was mesmerizing in the sheer breadth of his knowledge and his lifetime experience
for all his achievements and accomplishments read my friend marilyn berger's definitive obituary in the new york times
ben was also hilarious and courtly ribald and bawdy handsome and craggy and full of the best stories ever
at dinner he could conjure up a whole spellbinding era of the history he had lived and covered before the main course was served and often in french
and that was part of his gravitational pull
ben embodied a different era when top flight journalists were the friends and counselors of presidents as he was to john f. kennedy
and when need be their adversary as with the mounting watergate revelations
ben defined the times when a headline a story a byline in the washington post et al could shift history
the truth is his reporters would have followed him through rings of fire
i consider myself unbelievably lucky to have worked for two of the great revolutionaries of our business ted turner who created cnn and changed the world with twenty four seven global news and don hewitt the legendary tv innovator and creator of sixty minutes
i wish i could have worked for ben
but perhaps i was luckier certainly i was enormously proud to call him my friend
a little earlier this year renowned conductor lorin maazel died aged eighty four after a long and distinguished career as grand maestro
while we weren't close friends i think i can say we bonded through an extraordinary shared experience
the two thousand and eight visit by the new york philharmonic orchestra to pyongyang north korea
in light of the u.s. government accusing north korea of the massive hack attack against sony at the end of this year it is extraordinary to look back and reflect on a different atmosphere that existed between the two countries for a brief moment in time
along with a large delegation of international press i was invited to travel with the new york philharmonic on a cultural odyssey
maestro maazel was thrilled
just as ping pong diplomacy had opened the door to normalizing relations between the united states and communist china he told me he hoped musical diplomacy could do the same with one of the last bastions of entrenched communist dictatorship
and so one freezing sunny morning in february a planeload of enthusiasts all landed in pyongyang in a flourish the likes of which the government and the people had never seen
we watched as maazel and his musicians prepped and rehearsed gave masterclasses to some of north korea's top musicians and finally delivered a bravura performance on stage at the city's main concert hall
the audience was treated to all american tunes by george gershwin and the concert ended with one of korea's best loved folk songs arirang
north korea's invited elite were on their feet with standing ovations
and for two countries still officially at war since the korean war ended only with an armistice just imagine how it felt in that concert hall and for koreans listening on radio and tv at home to hear both countries national anthems played in public on stage for the first time
remember this was during the bush administration george w. bush had called north korea part of the axis of evil and yet change was in the air
away from the concert hall i was one of a small group of journalists taken to the yongbyon nuclear plant where then leader kim jong il had started mothballing crucial parts and freezing the weapons program
a few months later i went back to witness north korea blow up the plant's iconic cooling tower
it seemed lorin maazel and the new york philharmonic were on to something
but shortly thereafter kim jong il fell ill and died his son kim jong un came to power with a ruthless streak a penchant for testing his nuclear weapons and apparently capable of massive cyber attacks on america's top companies
lorin maazel died without realizing this dream but i am grateful to have been there for that brief moment in time when he brought hope and the sound of beautiful music to north korea

gene seymour is a film critic who has written about music movies and culture for the new york times newsday entertainment weekly and the washington post
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writer
he seemed at that moment less like a rock star than like someone who sort of wandered on stage from the multitudes of motley young people jostling and undulating in the meadow
he appeared dazed and confused
a scruffy spectacularly unglamorous fellow who somehow found himself among the rock n roll aristocracy who showed up in woodstock new york forty five summers ago to help administer a collective blessing upon a generation
then joe cocker started to sing a song that it's safe to say everybody within hearing range of that stage knew by heart
it was what was widely recognized as the ringo number from the already classic beatles album sgt
pepper's lonely hearts club band from two years ago
with a little help from my friends was the kind of catchy user friendly ditty that even a stuffy grown up could love enough to sing along with decades before anyone heard the word karaoke
anybody in other words could make the song work for them whether in a shower or a corner bar
joe cocker at that moment did more than just make it work
he worked that song over ripping its delicate amiable stitching apart and transfiguring it into something with more grandeur tumult and dramatic tension than the beatles could have imagined
the cameras that captured that transfixing performance for all time stayed on him for practically the entire song drifting up and down cocker's spasmodic form focusing on his hands as they mimed an invisible instrument wrenching every lick spin and extended variation he could summon through the vibrant coarseness of his voice
that little ditty ringo star introduced to the world became in cocker's fitful jerking hands an epic flag waver a soul music anthem
cocker didn't just cover that song
he conquered it and made it his own
his performance one of the many peaks of the one thousand nine hundred and seventy eponymous documentary about that festival woodstock was the first thing most people of a certain age thought of when they heard the news of cocker's death at seventy from lung cancer
it was what monday's cbs evening news broadcast mentioned first and foremost when mentioning cocker's passing and the film clip accompanied many tweets and posts on social media
galvanic as that moment was it was only the beginning of a solid steady career for cocker who scored serial blues rock hits throughout the one thousand nine hundred and seventy s including feelin alright and you are so beautiful
his one thousand nine hundred and eighty two duet with jennifer warnes up where we belong pretty much capped his string of hits
his gravelly voice and his contortions however remained in demand throughout the world and it says something about his enduring appeal that so many people from different generations say they went straight to those and other tunes to hear that aching fiery growl once again
most appropriately for a man who exploded into being at a long ago festival devoted to peace and love there came a special tweet today from someone wishing the same to cocker's spirit
it came from ringo starr

famed boxer muhammad ali has vastly improved after being hospitalized over the weekend with a mild case of pneumonia his spokesman bob gunnell said
ali's team of doctors hopes to discharge him soon said gunnell
ali seventy two was admitted to an undisclosed hospital on saturday
the ali family continues to request privacy and appreciates all of the prayers and well wishes read a statement sent from gunnell
ali was born cassius clay and won an olympic gold medal as a light heavyweight at eighteen
in one thousand nine hundred and sixty four he became world heavyweight champion in an upset victory against then champion sonny liston according to ali's official website
shortly thereafter he changed his name to muhammad ali to reflect his conversion to islam
the boxer was also known for his protest against the vietnam war and refusal to be drafted into service out of religious conviction
he retired from boxing in one thousand nine hundred and eighty one and announced his diagnosis with parkinson's disease three years later

the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author
some years ago i was the municipal prosecutor in a midsize new jersey town
i had weekly night court duties where we handled traffic violations duis and other nonfelonies
i can say without reservation that during the years i worked as a prosecutor i held the police in the highest regard and greatly trusted them
i felt this way for years after i stopped prosecuting
but those feelings are gone
don't get me wrong i don't view the police as the enemy
i simply don't trust them like i once did
i no longer give them the benefit of the doubt meaning i can now just as easily believe the suspect's version of the facts as the police officers
and i can easily believe allegations of police misconduct
and here's what new york city police union leader patrick lynch and others like him in the new york police department don't get
i'm not the exception
in fact my views about police put me in the company of a growing number of americans
a gallup poll released a few weeks ago found that forty eight percents of americans view the police as possessing high or very high levels of honesty and ethics
that number is not only down six percentage points from two thousand and thirteen it's the lowest in almost twenty years
in contrast sixty eight percents of americans viewed the police as possessing high levels of honesty and ethics in two thousand and one
that's an astounding twenty point drop in thirteen years
to me these falling poll numbers are tied at least in part to a case like eric garner the unarmed man placed in a chokehold by a new york officer and who died a short time later
a recent poll found that fifty seven percents of americans believed that the grand jury had made a mistake in failing to indict the officer who had choked garner with only twenty two percents agreeing with the grand jury's decision
it's with that twenty two percents of people where lynch president of the new york city patrolmen's benevolent association and his compatriots stand
indeed after the grand decision was announced a few weeks ago lynch made matters worse with two tone deaf comments
first he seemingly blamed garner for his own death with the remark garner made a choice that day to resist arrest
he then shockingly added that garner's death is a tragedy for this police officer who has to live with that death
a tragedy for the police officer 
the police officer is alive
garner is dead
yet to lynch we should have sympathy for the police officer who most of us believe should be facing criminal charges for homicide
and lynch has not let up in his apparent efforts to drive a wedge between the public and the new york police department
on saturday night shortly after we learned of the horrific slayings of two new york police officers at the hands of a man who reportedly said he wanted to avenge the deaths of garner and michael brown lynch released one of the most irresponsible statements i've ever heard from a person in his position
lynch said there's blood on many hands in the cop killings
first he blamed new york mayor bill de blasio who has in the past been slightly critical of certain of the department's actions saying that the blood on the hands starts on the steps of city hall in the office of the mayor
then lynch blamed the recent protesters who had taken to the streets to denounce the grand jury decision in the garner case
just so it's clear a small number of protesters did despicably chant what do we want 
dead cops
but it's outlandish to blame the protesters for the actions of a man with a long criminal record who had shot his girlfriend only hours before killing the police officers
lynch's comments sounded like a politician using a tragedy to score political points
in fact former new york gov
george pataki a republican who is said to be considering a presidential run in two thousand and sixteen made comments similar to lynch's via twitter where he blamed de blasio for the tragedy
lynch is missing the big picture
sure for politicians such as pataki pandering to the base is the norm
but the leader of a union that represents more than thirty four thousand uniformed officers charged with protecting and serving the public needs to be better than offering up red meat to his supporters
lynch is viewed by many as the spokesman for rank and file new york police department officers
consequently his remarks could result in an even fewer americans viewing the police in a favorable light
that does not bode well for us a nation
if we collectively view the police as an untrustworthy adversary and not an ally it undermines the very notion of community based policing that is the cornerstone to effective policing
the question is
will lynch and his supporters change their tune or will they make matters worse 

a new video released by al qaeda in the arabian peninsula confirms the group's senior leaders were closely involved in the plot to blow up a u.s. airliner over detroit five years ago and that american born cleric anwar al awlaki was among them
the video released by al qaeda in the arabian peninsula's official media arm shows a short clip of the underwear bomber umar farouk abdulmutallab together with both the group's leader nasir al wuhayshi and al awlaki
cnn is unable to confirm the authenticity of the clip which is in slow motion and lasts barely five seconds
but laith alkhouri of flashpoint partners which monitors jihadist media releases says it appears to be genuine
a previous al qaeda in the arabian peninsula video released in june showed abdulmutallab embracing al wuhayshi who is now deputy to al qaeda leader ayman al zawahiri
abdulmutallab's communications and meetings with al awlaki were previously known
but this video underlines the extent to which al awlaki was by the fall of two thousand and nine closely involved with al qaeda in the arabian peninsula's leadership
abdulmutallab a nigerian student boarded a northwest airlines flight from amsterdam to detroit on christmas day two thousand and nine with a device hidden in his underpants
he was unable to detonate it as the airliner descended to its destination
the video some thirty minutes long is a compilation celebrating an important clan in central yemen the dahab and specifically three brothers nabil qa'id and tariq
they had become prominent supporters of al qaeda in the arabian peninsula and formed a friendship with al awlaki who married their sister
one of the brothers qa'id al dahab recruited abdulmutallab in the yemeni capital and brought him to the attention of the al qaeda in the arabian peninsula leadership in autumn two thousand and nine according to alkhouri
during abdulmutallab's brief trial it was disclosed that the nigerian had told the fbi he had been introduced in sana'a to an al qaeda operative named abu tarak who became his principal handler
it seems abu tarak may in fact have been one of the al dahab brothers
in late november two thousand and nine abu tarak enlisted abdulmutallab in al qaeda in the arabian peninsula's plan to attack an american airliner
in releasing the video now al qaeda in the arabian peninsula is drawing attention to the role of dahab family members in its ongoing battles against houthi militia in bayda and trying to rally support in what has become a draining war of attrition
battles between al qaeda fighters and houthi militia across a wide swath of central yemen are an almost daily occurrence
bomb attacks in ra'da last week killed more than twenty people including fifteen girls on a bus
al qaeda in the arabian peninsula was quick to blame the houthi for the girls deaths

one victim is dead and five others are hospitalized after the latest in a string of attacks that sparked fears in france authorities said tuesday
prime minister manuel valls announced tuesday the country is boosting security with up to three hundred additional security forces
a twenty five year old man died from his injuries suffered monday night in nantes when a van plowed into shoppers at an outdoor christmas market nantes prosecutor brigitte lamy said
in addition to the five victims hospitalized the driver is as well lamy said
the driver stabbed himself twice after the incident but is expected to survive said pierre henry brandet a spokesman for france's interior ministry
an investigation for murder and attempted murder has been opened
officials have said the incident appears to be an isolated case and not an act of terrorism
but it came after two other incidents in which the perpetrators were reported to have been yelling god is great in arabic at the time of their attacks
one took place sunday in dijon in which a man rammed his vehicle into pedestrians injuring at least twelve police said
a man has been arrested in connection with the case
cnn affiliate bfm tv reported that eyewitnesses heard the driver shout the phrase allahu akbar
on saturday a man stabbed three police officers in central france while allegedly calling out the same phrase
french counterterrorism authorities are investigating that attack
cnn terrorism analyst paul cruickshank reported that the attacker behind sunday's incident was a forty year old french north african with a long history of psychiatric problems and the perpetrator of sunday's attack was a twenty year old french burundian who had posted the isis flag on his facebook page
france's prime minister has said his country has never faced as serious a terrorism threat as it does now
there is in france
a terrorist threat valls said tuesday
we want to protect and reassure the french and tell them that all state services are mobilized valls said adding in these times of crisis we must act with knowledge judgment and self control
crowded shopping and tourist areas are already being patrolled by about seven hundred and eighty soldiers and those numbers were being by another two hundred to three hundred tuesday he said
we will not offer the victory of fear to those who want to weaken our democracy the prime minister said
european officials tell cnn the threat of terrorist attack in the european union is greater than at any time since nine eleven because of the emergence of jihadist safe havens in syria and iraq cruickshank wrote for cnn dot com
but no country faces a greater terrorist threat than france with support for isis running deep among disenfranchised immigrant communities in the rundown crime ridden banlieues that surround many french towns

the number of ebola cases in west africa has not reached worst case scenario predictions but until it drops to zero the world remains at risk the cdc director said monday
speaking to reporters after a visit to liberia guinea and sierra leone centers for disease prevention director dr. tom frieden said he saw real momentum and real progress in combating the virus
it's going to be a long hard fight but i am hopeful that we are going to see continued progress
the challenge is not to let up not to be complacent and to really double down he said
last week the world health organization put the number of reported deaths from ebola at six thousand nine hundred and fifteen with more than eighteen thousand six hundred cases of the disease reported
asked about the cdc's report in september that in certain scenarios ebola cases could reach five hundred and fifty thousand by january frieden said
the projections we released a few months ago showed what could happen if nothing more were done in fact an enormous amount has been done
he said what had changed was the world's reaction response to not letting that happen
liberia had the most hopeful picture of the three countries frieden said
as of today it has the upper hand over the virus
this was due to the country's implementation of the rapid isolation and treatment for ebola approach he said
extensive challenges remain however in sierra leone he said
sierra leone has by far the largest number of cases of the three countries at this point and is in a rapid scale up phase
this is in part a result of the challenge of complacency he said
as the number of cases fell he said health care workers were relaxing their grip by for example not wearing protective clothing or ignoring the possibility of ebola infection when treating patients for other ailments
three actions were important to combat the next phase of the outbreak frieden said
first break the cycle of exponential growth
second trace every chain of transmission and ensure the intensive followup of every patient with ebola
and third strengthen the areas that were now ebola free to prevent outbreaks there he said
the next phase is in many ways harder it's tracing every single case to break every single chain of transmission including in highly mobile urban areas and that's going to be challenging he said
the problem is there are clusters all over and new ones popping up all the time
till each of the three countries get to the last cluster the last case then we're at risk
a lot had been done to combat ebola frieden said but it was still a work in progress with for example more french speaking health care workers needed in guinea to stop the spread there
tools on the horizon included a new point of care diagnostic kit that would allow health care workers to diagnose the virus on the spot rather than having to make sometimes arduous trips back from remote areas for lab testing of suspected cases
frieden said that another new initiative in sierra leone would allow the vaccination of thousands of health care workers if and when a safe vaccine was developed
but he said with new tools especially the vaccine we have to ardently hope that they work urgently but we can't count on them working

samuel yaga a mechanic was making a routine repair on a client's car when his phone rang
it was a phone call that would change his life forever
i was called in the morning by my elder brother notifying me of an attack on the school where my daughter was schooling he said
samuel's blood went cold as his brother continued telling him that some of the girls had been abducted by boko haram
samuel knew only too well the vicious and brutal nature of the terrorist group
just a few months before this boko haram had attacked his village in northeastern nigeria
armed men forced him out of his house and one of them pointed a gun to his head
by a sheer miracle unexplainable even to samuel one of the militants intervened and his life was spared
their entire village was razed to the ground and so samuel moved his family to chibok and enrolled his eldest daughter sarah into the government secondary school so that she could sit for her final high school exam
he chose chibok because not only was it his ancestral home and he had relatives there but also because it had no history of boko haram attacks
he felt it was safe until now
later in the day samuel's brother phoned him again
then before sunset he called me again and informed me that my daughter was part of those that were taken by boko haram
his wife rebecca says the news of her daughter's abduction tore at her heart
she refused to believe it when her husband first told it to her until it was confirmed on the evening news
seriously seriously mum and her daughter
the pain is indescribable she reflects
rebecca says there is not a day that goes by that she does think of her daughter
she describes her daughter as an ambitious girl who saw education as a way out of poverty
she used to tell me one day she will finish school and become somebody
she used to assist the younger ones with their homework she said
she loved studies
she used to fall asleep with her books in her arms she added
her father remembers her as the caring eldest child who used to secretly collect his dirty clothes wash them and press them for him
he also remembers her passion for knowledge
she is brilliant
she liked reading
always she loved going to school he said
inside their small one roomed house there is nothing to indicate that the christmas festive season has begun
they say christmas used to be a time of laughter and spending time with family
every christmas we used to be complete and happy but now one of us is not there how can it be the same 
asks samuel
there is nothing i can say
it has happened
it is a bad christmas
but there is nothing we can do says rebecca
a sadness surrounds the couple as they clutch to the only physical memory that they have of their daughter a few photos and one bright green top one of her favorites
but although they are at low spirits they say their hopes remain high that their daughter will come back
they pass on that encouragement to their other five children who say they miss their sister
her siblings know that she is not here they themselves know what is happening having come out of war says samuel
they keep asking me when is she coming back 
but i keep telling them to keep trusting god
maybe he will hear us he adds

gouri abdelmalek leader of jund al khilafa and two other militants were killed in the algerian city of isser after the military set an unspecified trap for them aps reported tuesday citing algeria's defense ministry
the report of abdelmalek's death comes roughly three months after jund al khilafa a small islamist group formerly linked to al qaeda published a video showing the beheading of gourdel in what the group said was a display of support to al qaeda's rival isis
gourdel fifty five was hiking in central algeria's djudjura national park when he was abducted in september
jund al khilafa having just declared allegiance to the islamic state in iraq and syria then published a video of gourdel's beheading on september twenty four
the video was titled a message of blood for the french government
the group said it was responding to an appeal by isis spokesman muhammad al adnani to kill the spiteful and filthy french because of their support for military action against the group in iraq
a video message showing the execution was designed to resemble beheadings carried out by isis as were the words of one of the militants who said
let the french people know that their blood is cheap for their president and it is the same as you made the blood of the muslim women and children cheap in iraq and sham
the algerian government called the beheading an act of criminals and french president francois hollande said at the time that algeria's prime minister assured him he would do the utmost to find the killers
on monday the algerian army launched its attack in isser after tracking what it believed was a dangerous terrorist group driving a vehicle in the city the algerian defense ministry said according to aps
abdelmalek was later confirmed as one of the three that the army killed aps reported tuesday
jund al khilafa which means soldiers of the caliphate had been a part of al qaeda in the islamic maghreb
abdelmalek who was the commander of aqim's central region said in september that his fighters were abandoning aqim because of the certain deviation of the methods of the mother organization al qaeda and that of the islamic maghreb
abdelmalek had been active in a militant islamist insurgency in algeria for fourteen years
gourdel was just one of the westerners to be beheaded by an islamist extremist group this year
since mid august isis has beheaded american journalists steven sotloff and james foley british aid worker david haines british aid convoy volunteer alan henning and american aid worker peter kassig

a billionaire who jointly controlled asia's biggest property development company and a man who was once hong kong's second ranked official were sentenced to prison for conspiracy to commit misconduct in one of the city's most significant corruption trials
tycoon thomas kwok received a five year sentence tuesday and former chief secretary rafael hui got seven and a half years after having been found guilty by a hong kong high court jury last week
kwok was also ordered to pay a sixty four thousand four hundred and fifty three dollar fine and one point six million dollar in costs to the prosecution while hui was ordered to pay the hong kong government one point four million dollar equivalent to the amount of bribes taken
the main question during their trial was whether kwok and his younger brother raymond kwok had bought the allegiance of hui when he was in public office in offenses spanning nearly a decade
the brothers ranked eighty six th on the two thousand and fourteen forbes list of the world's richest people were co chairs of the developer giant sun hung kai which is responsible for many of hong kong's most iconic skyscrapers
the jury found the older kwok sixty three guilty of the charge of conspiracy to commit misconduct for having bribed hui between two thousand and five and two thousand and seven
raymond kwok was cleared of all charges
in hong kong the maximum penalty for misconduct and conspiracy for misconduct is seven years in prison and an unlimited fine
in passing sentence judge andrew macrae said he had discounted a year of imprisonment from kwok's sentence to reflect his philanthropic work
kwok is also prohibited from serving as director of a company for five years
last week he resigned from his position at sun hung kai and his son adam kwok was named the company's next executive director
in a sentencing hearing monday kwok's lawyer clare montgomery said her client was a man of good character with no previous convictions
she added that the conspiracy to commit misconduct charge related only to a short period of time and the court could not say whether or not he was the leader of that conspiracy
montgomery also added that imprisonment would be a burden on his wife and his eighty six year old mother who is in poor health
hui sixty six is the highest ranking former official to be tried in hong kong
the court looked into whether hui received monetary and housing benefits from the kwoks in return for government decisions favorable to the company
the charges related to accepting rent free apartments unsecured loans and a consultancy agreement with the property company
the jury found him guilty on three counts of misconduct in a public office conspiracy to commit misconduct in public office and conspiracy to offer an advantage to a public servant
judge macrae said that as the instigator of the corruption hui should receive the harsher sentence
the judge said that had he not committed the offending hui may have been the finest chief secretary in the territory's recent history
he said the offending did nothing to dispel the perception in hong kong that government and business leaders were cozying up
the jury also found thomas chan who was responsible for land acquisition at the company and francis kwan a former hong kong stock exchange official guilty of making a series of payments to hui
during the sentencing hearing yesterday hui's defence lawyer edwin choy read out a mitigation letter from the former chief executive of hong kong donald tsang
in his letter tsang said
i was devastated when the jury found him guilty
the former leader of hong kong described hui as an extraordinary and outstanding person
he also called on the judge to take into account hui's contribution to the city's economy including his role in protecting hong kong during the asian financial crisis in one thousand nine hundred and ninety seven
the case caused a media frenzy in the city where real estate is a local obsession
sun hung kai which helped to build some of the tallest buildings in the city's celebrated skyline contributed to the kwok brothers estimated eighteen point three billion dollar fortune
hong kong a special administrative region of china is considered to be one of the world's least corrupt territories
according to transparency international's two thousand and thirteen corruptions perceptions index hong kong is the fifteen th least corrupt territory in the world with the united states by comparison ranked nineteen th

it's a story which has captured the imagination of the english premier league and persuaded one uk retailer to use it for its christmas tv advert but did rival armies really turn the world war i killing fields into a football field 
a century on from the first christmas of the great war there has been a rush to commemorate one of the most iconic moments in british military history
the story goes that on december twenty five one thousand nine hundred and fourteen both german and british forces laid down their weapons and took part in a game of football which was to be dubbed as the christmas truce
it is a tale which has inspired the premier league's successful educational program as well as a christmas television commercial for sainsbury's one of the uk's largest supermarkets
but while many have been quick to embrace one of the war's most famous tales some historians have begun to raise questions over whether the legendary football match even took place at all
the clearest recollection of the famous match reported to have occurred came from ernie williams a former soldier in the british army
he claimed that he had taken part in the match at wulverghem in belgium during a television interview which was recorded in one thousand nine hundred and eighty three
the ball appeared from somewhere i don't know where but it came from their side it wasn't from our side that the ball came he said
they made up some goals and one fellow went in goal and then it was just a general kickabout
i should think there were about a couple of hundred taking part
i had a go at the ball
i was pretty good then at nineteen
everybody seemed to be enjoying themselves
there was no sort of ill will between us
there was no referee and no score no tally at all
it was simply a melee nothing like the soccer you see on television
the boots we wore were a menace those great big boots we had on and in those days the balls were made of leather and they soon got very soggy
mark connelly professor of modern british history at the center for war propaganda and society at the uk's university of kent believes the entire episode has been romanticized in the intervening years
the notion of two sets of soldiers simply laying down their arms and waltzing out of the trenches ready to play an organized game of football is not one he subscribes to
in fact he says there is no absolute hard verifiable evidence of a match taking place and says the event has been glorified beyond recognition
i think it highly likely that someone somewhere did bring out a ball and a bit of a kick about took place but that is a long long way from saying it definitely happened and that it was anything like a formal match rather than just men tapping a ball about a bit connelly told cnn
there is a huge difference between a truce and fraternization and we have tended to put the two together
truces are very common in war and often involve both sides ignoring each other in order to carry out common tasks often burial of dead and retrieval of wounded
at christmas one thousand nine hundred and fourteen where the truce occurred most men took part in it in this tacit manner rather than actively fraternized which is clearly much more romantic and appealing
it also made not the slightest bit of difference to the wider mindset of the armies it was clearly temporary and hostilities would obviously resuming
the role of the football match has been thrust into the public consciousness this year by both the english football association and the premier league who have produced educational programs for children and held a series of events to mark the one hundred th anniversary
the premier league set up its christmas truce tournament in two thousand and eleven and has held it each year since in ypres belgium
the latest edition was held earlier this month with teams from across europe coming together to compete at the tournament for boys aged twelve and under
all twenty premier league teams from england were represented and were joined by clubs from belgium germany scotland france and austria
the two day competition which was won by chelsea ran alongside an extensive educational program created especially for the occasion
the participants visited one of the sites which is alleged to have hosted a football match during christmas one thousand nine hundred and fourteen while they also visited war graves and memorials while learning what life was like in the trenches
they also laid wreaths at the menin gate the memorial dedicated to the british and commonwealth soldiers who died during battle
i think it's really important that young people learn their history and lesson that can be learned from events such as the war martin heather head of education at the premier league told cnn
being able to use the christmas truce element of the first world war is really important
it gives some really key messages around reconciliation friendship and respect
it's not about glorifying the horrors of war far from it
it's about fantastic acts of humanity amongst such horror
this is the fourth year we've held the tournament and each year they clubs and players become more and more engaged
it has been incredible to see how much these kids engage
i think we need to educate our future players and we can use football to educate younger players
we want to produce all round people
it's not just about what you create on the pitch it's about what you create off the pitch too
the modern player needs to be able to cope with both elements
the premier league has teamed up with the english football association football league and british council to launch football remembers an education pack which was sent to thirty thousand schools in the united kingdom
a number of initiatives have been launched which have seen children design memorials write poems and help record a version of uk pop act the farm's all together now song which has been released across the uk
the project which officially began earlier this month will run until two thousand and eighteen to mark the end of the great war
teams from across the uk both professional and amateur uploaded pregame photos to social media with the hashtag footballremembers in memory of those who fought and died in the war
richard scudamore the chief of executive of the premier league also unveiled a brand new football field for use in ypres as a lasting memorial
the three g pitch which is used by the residents of ypres during the day and local belgian club kvk westhoek at night and weekends can also be hired by premier league clubs if they guarantee that they will provide an educational program while at the venue
one man who was present at the menin gate ceremony was max von olenhusen the great grandson of general leo gtz von olenhusen
his great grandfather was in charge of the german forty th infantry division which held the line at ypres on christmas day one thousand nine hundred and fourteen
he spoke with the children and said that the program could prove crucial to providing a real insight into what happened during some of europe's darkest days
i think you can't start early enough teaching children about the importance of friendship fair play and making friends across different cultures and those are tremendous values to instil at a very early age he said
if you can do that through a medium like football which is so important and so central to these boys i think that's really really great
it's a great project
it's about the attitude
if they become professional footballers you are trying to learn from role models and if you can learn about good role models in history i think that's a good thing
also to have an outlook on life that you say actually i am living quite a privileged life at the moment i live in a period of peace which has now lasted for more than sixty years and for these guys it was probably just a day or two 
so to recognize your own position and say i am enjoying something which these guys had for only two days before they maybe died that's an amazing educational experience
while there is no debate over the premier league's commitment to education nor the way the truce has been portrayed by the organization some historians believe the whole story has been grossly exaggerated
professor thomas weber author of the book hitler's first war and a visiting lecturer at harvard university says the truth lays somewhere in between
i think it is fair to say that the football matches that took place during christmas one thousand nine hundred and fourteen have both at times been downplayed and at other times been blown out of all proportion weber told cnn
a number of independent reports and sources exist that report on football being played between german and british soldiers during christmas one thousand nine hundred and fourteen
i find it not credible to argue that they were all fabricated
after the war with millions of soldiers killed maimed or missing it just was not opportune to speak about wartime fraternization
there is ample of evidence that subsequent generations tried to write not just anglo german football matches but any kind of friendly encounter of enemy combatants out of the story after the event
at the same time people sometimes have also exaggerated the importance of soccer games in one thousand nine hundred and fourteen by sentimentalizing them and by presenting the christmas truce as a juncture where the war could still have been stopped
shirley seaton who co authored the book christmas truce with her colleague malcolm brown has also questioned the glorification of the so called match
in the book she claims that the ground on christmas day was frozen destroyed by shells and littered with dead bodies
the football match has been falsely blown up especially this year seaton told cnn
while seaton acknowledges that there have been accounts of such an event particularly in the testimony provided by williams she remains skeptical claiming the ground would have been strewn with dead bodies and shells while the land was frozen because of the cold weather
the event of the truce and fraternization over so much of the british sector of the line is what was so remarkable not the very few kick abouts she added
football was a popular sport at the time in germany and britain and often played behind the lines when the men were at rest
the main activity during this truce was the opportunity to bury the dead which had been lying between the lines as well as talking and exchanging gifts
it was also a chance to work above ground to dig trenches and build defenses for both germans and british
the story has also been portrayed on television by sainsbury's one of the most prominent retailers in the uk
its television commercial which shows a version of the christmas truce attracted seven hundred and twenty seven complaints but the advertising standards authority the country's governing body for such matters insisted there was no case to answer
in a statement the asa commented
we recognize that some have found the use of the first world war for advertising purposes to be distasteful the ad is not likely to break the rules surrounding serious harm or offense
we also considered that the ad is obviously distinguishable from editorial content and therefore is not likely to mislead
in a statement sainsbury's head of brand communications mark given said the commercial had been widely lauded by viewers
we are very pleased that the asa have decided that there are no grounds to investigate our christmas advertisement he told cnn in a statement
we've been delighted with the overwhelmingly positive response we've had from customers and colleagues to our portrayal of the one thousand nine hundred and fourteen christmas day truce
we partnered with the royal british legion in the twenty th year of our relationship with them to ensure we tell this story with authenticity and respect and to help raise awareness and additional funds for the important work they do
while questions remain over the historical accuracy of the football match and the truce there can be no doubt as to football's commitment to remembering the fallen
the premier league and fa have run numerous events while individual clubs such as leyton orient which played a huge role in the war under its former guise as clapton orient have also marked the occasion with a number of ceremonies
it was on december fifteen one thousand nine hundred and fourteen when the footballers battalion was formed and several players signed up join the army and fight against the german forces
many were killed during fighting while those who returned such as frank buckley would go on to coach the english national side
while football's contribution to the great war is well documented the story of the football match during the truce of one thousand nine hundred and fourteen is relatively new in a historical sense
the truce seems to have been popularized only since the one thousand nine hundred and sixty s chris barker author of the battle for flanders
german defeat on the lys one thousand nine hundred and eighteen
no doubt the men who took part had it as a central part of their memory but it really does not seem to have featured much from one thousand nine hundred and fifteen to the one thousand nine hundred and sixty s
it was an important event and of course it is a very positive image but it was short affected only a small fraction of the four hundred miles of the western front and made no different to the way the war progressed
while historians continue to debate over the actual validity of the legendary football match there can be little doubt of the impact that the educational program and its impact has had on the children fortunate enough to visit ypres
hundreds of youngsters have visited war sites and memorials while the players they watch each and every week in the premier league have also taken time to remember
if we can get young people to learn their history by using education and football then that will be fantastic added heather
we want those kids to look at the players from their own clubs who went out to fight in the first world war
we want them to know about those who died those who lived and came back to pursue a career or those who chose another path
we want them to learn about this legacy

late last year french prime minister manuel valls said his country had never faced a greater terrorist threat
officials tell cnn the threat of terrorist attack in the european union is greater than at any time since nine eleven because of the emergence of jihadist safe havens in syria and iraq
but no country faces a greater terrorist threat than france with support for isis running deep among disenfranchised immigrant communities in the rundown crime ridden banlieues that surround many french cities
the numbers tell the story
three hundred and ninety french extremists are now fighting with jihadist groups in syria and iraq according to french officials with two hundred and thirty one believed to be on their way
fifty one have been killed in suicide bombings and combat
and two hundred and thirty four have left the conflict zone with one hundred and eighty five now back in france
since the summer of two thousand and thirteen french police say they have thwarted five terror plots
nerves were rattled in the run up to christmas after a knife attack in a police station in tours and car ramming attacks in dijon and nantes on three consecutive days
the tours attack was the only one of the three that was definitively linked to islamist terrorism
a few days after posting an isis flag on his facebook page bertrand nzohabonayo a french burundian extremist entered a police station in the central french town of tours on dec. twenty and stabbed several officers before being shot dead
isis has explicitly called for lone wolf terrorist attacks in france because of its participation in airstrikes in iraq by the u.s. led coalition
if you are not able to find an ied or a bullet then single out the disbelieving american frenchman or any of their allies
smash his head with a rock or slaughter him with a knife or run him over with your car or throw him down from a high place or choke him or poison him isis spokesman abu muhammad al adnani stated in an audiotape in september
on nov. nineteen three french isis fighters appeared in a french language video put out by the group's propaganda arm repeating the call for attacks in france
one of them stated
terrorize them and do not allow them to sleep due to fear and horror
there are weapons and cars available and targets ready to be hit
even poison is available so poison the water and food of at least one of the enemies of allah
kill them and spit in their faces and run over them with your cars
do whatever you are able to do in order to humiliate them for they deserve only this
a significant number of the nearly four hundred french nationals now fighting in syria and iraq are believed to have joined isis
that includes maxime hauchard a twenty two year old convert from normandy who french authorities suspect participated in the grisly on camera beheading of more than a dozen members of the syrian armed forces in november orchestrated by the british jihadi john
french officials have for some time been worried that those on their way back to france or already back in the country could launch attacks
in february police in cannes broke up an alleged plot to bomb targets in france by ibrahim boudina a french algerian extremist who had allegedly just returned from fighting with isis in syria
police say they found almost a kilogram of the high explosive tatp in his family's cannes apartment building
boudina has denied the allegations against him
mehdi nemmouche a french algerian isis fighter who allegedly helped guard western hostages in syria before returning to europe allegedly shot and killed four people at a jewish museum in brussels in may
nemmouche was arrested in france and extradited to face trial in belgium
he has denied the charges
in both the cannes and brussels plots investigators believe it is possible the men were acting on their own steam
no evidence has been publicly released suggesting isis leadership signed off on the plots
it is not just isis causing concern to french security officials
european counterterrorism officials tell cnn a relatively high number of french extremists have joined isis rival jabhat al nusra al qaeda's affiliate in syria
of most concern
david drugeon a french convert from brittany who has emerged as one of the most skilled bomb makers in the khorasan group an al qaeda a team based in syria's idlib province with ties to jabhat al nusra
u.s. officials tell cnn they believe drugeon has been working on nonmetallic explosive devices that the group hoped to smuggle on board western passenger aircraft and has been talent spotting european extremists in syria who can be trained for attacks in europe
drugeon was injured in a u.s. drone strike that hit a vehicle he was traveling in november
in november france adopted tough new anti terror legislation making it easier to shut down jihadist websites and confiscate passports and identity cards of those suspected of wanting to travel overseas to fight jihad
but critics say the french government has done too little to tackle one of the key contributing factors to radicalization
the deep sense of alienation toward mainstream society felt by a significant number of young muslim immigrants in the banlieues
in the years after nine eleven france was held up as a model by many for its assimilationist agenda and its zero tolerance of extremist radical preachers
britain by contrast was criticized for a multicultural approach that for too long offered political refuge to extremists from around the world
but by the late two thousand s islamist extremism had also become a significant problem in france
although french leaders paid lip service to assimilation the concept was only theoretical for young unemployed muslims living in impoverished banlieues whose socioeconomic grievances were more acute than their counterparts in the united kingdom
while france could crack down on radical preachers in the one thousand nine hundred and ninety s it was powerless to prevent the growth of jihadist websites and social media in the second half of the two thousand s
jihad in syria has become a cause celebre for french extremists able to access this content online
while many british extremists traveled to al qaeda's safe havens in afghanistan and pakistan in the years before and after nine eleven because of their language and kinship ties to the region much of france's banlieue population hails from north africa making travel to jihadist battlegrounds in the arab world easier and more attractive

senior executives and a team of medical staff from a chinese hospital in the northwestern province of shaanxi have been punished for taking group photos next to apparently unconscious patients after surgery state media reported on monday
a series of photos recently circulated on sina weibo a chinese microblogging site shows chinese doctors and nurses decked in scrubs posing with reportedly unconscious patients on the operating table in the operating theater
a man makes a v sign in one of the happy snaps while other doctors are seen leaning over the patient mid procedure
the xi'an bureau of public health has taken action for the photos taken in august this year removing three top executives from administrative duties at the privately run fengcheng hospital reported xinhua news agency
the other staff pictured in the photos have been reprimanded and docked three months pay
the hospital issued a public statement and apology explaining that the photos were taken to commemorate the last day that the operating theater was in use before it closed down in favor of new facilities
our staff members have neglected the possible negative consequences of their actions we will undergo an in depth review of the incident the statement reads
the photos have triggered a backlash on china's microblogging platforms
bloggers have taken to social media to express their opinions using the hashtag surgery selfie with many condemning the doctors lack of professional ethics
they are not acting professionally at all
they are treating the patients suffering as a joke how can they even take a selfie at a time like this 
one weibo user penny zhutou commented on a discussion thread
others expressed sympathy for the doctors
doctors are humans too
i don't think there is anything wrong with them wanting to take a photo to celebrate after a long and successful surgery
we should look at this rationally instead of being limited by those so called restrictions another weibo user diaolinghoucanque commented

north koreans ability to surf the internet for the few in the isolated nation who could ever really go online anyway is rockier than ever
dyn research reported on monday that the country's internet was down after twenty four hours of increasing instability
it stayed dead for more than nine hours then came back to life but not for long
half a day later dyn said it was down again
then it was back up at about one a.m. wednesday pyongyang time the company said
but the assessment of dyn a company that monitors internet performance worldwide made earlier tuesday did not change
north korea continues its struggles to stay online
the timing of north korea's latest internet issues makes them significant
they come days after the u.s. government blamed pyongyang for being behind the hacking of sony pictures over that company's production of the interview a comedy depicting the assassination of north korean leader kim jong un as well as threats against anyone who dared watch the movie
north korea denied any responsibility even as it blamed the u.s. government for being behind the making of the seth rogen james franco film
its totalitarian government went on to officially make its own threat warning the united states that its citadels will be attacked dwarfing the hacking attack on sony
pyongyang hasn't leveled any blame or threats about its latest internet outage
but experts are skeptical that the american government had any involvement
that's almost irrelevant said mike chinoy a frequent traveler to north korea and former cnn correspondent
the issue
is not whether it was or it wasn't
the issue is what the north koreans think it was said chinoy a u.s. china institute senior fellow
and i think it's safe to assume unless they themselves took their system offline for their own security which is not impossible they'll be looking to respond
expert
could be a fifteen year old in a guy fawkes mask 
so who is behind north korea's internet problems 
unlike the sony cyberattack and threats which were linked to a group called guardians of peace the latest issues haven't been tied to any group or government
it's possible they have nothing to do with the sony dust up and are simply an internal matter
another possibility
north korea's internet traffic is routed through china so issues or officials there may be to blame
another option
it could be a deliberate move by the country's own government
north korea may have disconnected themselves either preemptively to prevent that movie from being distributed but also probably more likely in a defensive posture said shawn henry a cybersecurity expert and former executive assistant director of the fbi
talking when north korea's internet was totally down dyn research's doug madory said usually there are isolated blips anyway in the country's service
but he thinks what happened here was different
i wouldn't be surprised if they are absorbing some sort of attack madory said
u.s. state department spokeswoman marie harf deflected a question about the disruption
we aren't going to discuss you know publicly operational details about the possible response options or comment on those kind of reports in any way except to say that as we implement our responses some will be seen some may not be seen she said
no one is saying the u.s. government couldn't have carried out such an attack
but tech experts say it might not have needed to given the ability of anyone anywhere to do something like this
what happened with sony especially the studio's decision to shelve at least temporarily the release of the interview got a lot of people upset
matthew prince president of the performance and security company cloudflare told cnn he couldn't say definitively that there was an attack at all
but if there was he said it's possible a lone individual not an entire government was behind it
if it is an attack it's highly unlikely it's the united states
more likely it's a fifteen year old in a guy fawkes mask said prince tying the prospective attackers to those connected to or inspired by the hacktivist movement anonymous
limited technology but not when it comes to hacking
do these outages equal outrage leaving north koreans unable to view gangnam style for the two billionth plus time 
have they been frustrated when they tried to check on the latest nba results for their fantasy teams or engage in heated debates about local national and international politics 
no
there's a reason the committee to protect journalists ranks north korea second on its list of most censored countries
only a smattering of ruling elites can go online freely leaving the public limited to a heavily monitored and censored network with no connections to the outside world according to the advocacy group
widespread computer technology overall isn't a reality in one of the world's poorest and according to many outsiders most antiquated countries
a two thousand and twelve report from kisa south korea's internet development agency noted north korea then had only one thousand and twenty four ip addresses unique numbers assigned to every device that logs on to the internet in a country of about twenty five million people
that figure may not exactly reflect the current usage since for example people can use one ip address for several items but it's still paltry by any modern measure
the united states has more than one point five billion ip addresses
still even if most north koreans aren't web savvy by design a dangerous handful of them may be
jang se yul who claims he worked as a computer expert for north korea's government before defecting seven years ago told cnn he thinks that pyongyang has one thousand eight hundred cyberwarriors stationed around the world
he says even the agents themselves don't know how many others work for the secretive group called bureau one hundred and twenty one whose mission is to conduct cyberattacks against overseas and enemy states
an fbi investigation linked the malware infrastructure and techniques used by the guardians of peace in the sony attack to previous north korean cyberattacks
after that u.s. president barack obama called the hack an act of cybervandalism that was very costly very expensive though he stopped sort of calling it an act of war
the next question is
will kim in pyongyang say the same about his country's internet issues 





six people have died after a garbage truck collided with pedestrians in the center of the scottish city of glasgow police confirmed monday
scottish police also promised further updates in a tweet monday
speaking to the bbc earlier monday superintendent stuart carroll said it appeared the bin lorry had struck one pedestrian before going up onto the sidewalk and colliding with a number of others
police said the truck crashed at the millennium hotel glasgow at george square
carroll said at least seven people had been seriously injured
the driver has also been taken to hospital where he is receiving treatment carroll said
for now it does not look to be either a criminal or deliberate act he said
assistant chief constable wayne mawson said investigations into the circumstances of the tragic incident were ongoing
we can however confirm that this is not a terrorism related incident he said
police earlier told cnn the incident was being investigated as a road accident
a glasgow police spokesperson said the incident occurred just after two thirty p.m. monday
diversions and road closures are in place and police have asked people to avoid the area
british prime minister david cameron said on twitter that he was being kept fully briefed on the incident
my thoughts are with the families of those involved and emergency services cameron said
first minister of scotland nicola sturgeon said her thoughts were with everyone involved in dreadful georgesquare incident

the blame game over the interview is intensifying
at the heart of the widening controversy are north korea's role in the devastating cyberattack on sony pictures and the studio's decision to pull the film amid threats against moviegoers
the crisis has rippled out into international relations business plans hollywood gossip and party politics
the different sides kept up their sparring over the weekend with president barack obama accusing north korea of cybervandalism and pyongyang claiming that the u.s. government was behind the making of the movie
here's the lowdown on who's saying what
north korea's rage over the seth rogen film about a plot to assassinate its leader kim jong un continues to boil
after the fbi's assertions that north korea was responsible for a hack into sony's computer systems kim's regime is still steadfastly denying involvement
on saturday it said the u.s. accusations were an attempt to frame us for this crime and suggested the two countries work together to investigate the hacking
but by sunday it was making less conciliatory noises offering the bizarre claim that it had clear evidence that the u.s. administration was deeply involved in the making of such dishonest reactionary movie
north korea also stepped up its threatening rhetoric warning the united states that it is targeting its citadels
our toughest counteraction will be boldly taken against the white house the pentagon and the whole u.s. mainland the cesspool of terrorism the statement carried by north korean state media said
the u.s. president told cnn on sunday that the hack was an act of cybervandalism that was very costly very expensive but that he doesn't consider it an act of war
obama said in the interview that the united states is going review whether to put north korea back on a list of states that sponsor terrorism
the president had previously said at a news conference friday that the united states will respond proportionally to the attack on sony without giving specifics
obama has also chided sony for its actions saying he that thinks the studio made a mistake in pulling the movie and that he wished the company had called him first
he expressed concerns to cnn's candy crowley on sunday about the broader implications of pulling the interview
if we set a precedent in which a dictator in another country can disrupt through cyber a company's distribution chain or its products and as a consequence we start censoring ourselves that's a problem obama said
sony entertainment chief executive michael lynton has defended the company's actions denying that the studio had caved by scrapping the planned release of the interview in theaters
he told cnn that obama and the public are mistaken as to what actually happened
in an interview with fareed zakaria that aired sunday he blamed movie theater companies that opted not to show the film saying they forced sony's hand
we do not own movie theaters lynton said
we can not determine whether or not a movie will be played in movie theaters
he also opened the door to a future release of the controversial comedy saying the company is considering some sort of release on the internet
we have always have had every desire to have the american public see this movie lynton said
in a statement released sunday the company said
no decisions have been made
sony is still exploring options for distribution
on saturday the guardians of peace the group of hackers who claim responsibility for the cyberattack on sony mocked the fbi in a new statement
the result of investigation by fbi is so excellent that you might have seen what we were doing with your own eye said the statement posted on the file sharing website pastebin
we congratulate you success
fbi is the best in the world
you will find the gift for fbi at the following address
enjoy
the link provided in the message leads to a youtube video titled you are an idiot
the fbi investigation linked the malware infrastructure and techniques used by the guardians of peace in the sony hack to previous north korean cyberattacks
in its comments sunday north korea said that fighters for justice including the guardians of peace are sharpening bayonets not only in the u.s. mainland but in all other parts of the world
north korea's closest ally has so far been staying out of the fray
but a senior obama administration official told cnn on saturday that united states has asked china for help battling north korean hacking
north korea's internet traffic goes through china
obama has said there's no indication that north korea was acting in conjunction with another country
chinese foreign minister wang yi spoke by phone with u.s. secretary of state john kerry on sunday night china's foreign ministry said in a statement posted on its website monday
wang stressed that china opposes all forms of cyberattacks and cyberterrorism the statement said omitting any mention of north korea
in washington republican sen. john mccain criticized obama's response to the sony hacking
he rejected obama's characterization of the north korean hack as an act of cybervandelism instead calling it a new form of warfare on cnn's state of the union
the president does not understand that this is a manifestation of a new form of warfare when you destroy economies when you are able to impose censorship mccain a republican from arizona said
it's more than vandalism
it's a new form of warfare that we're involved in and we need to react and we need to react vigorously
the republican national committee urged cinema chains to show the movie
in a letter to their ceos rnc chairman reince priebus wrote
as a sign of my commitment if you agree to show this movie i will send a note to the republican party's millions of donors and supporters urging them to buy a ticket not to support one movie or hollywood but to show north korea we can not be bullied into giving up our freedom

long time politician beji caid essebsi won the country's runoff with about fifty five percents of the vote beating outgoing president moncef marzouki's forty four percents state run media reported monday
it was a hard fought race
on sunday despite earlier indications essebsi had won supporters of marzouki rallied in downtown tunis
security forces responded to rock throwing rioters by firing tear gas to quickly disperse the crowds state run media reported
as a candidate essebsi promised to restore the state's prestige after the chaotic years since the two thousand and eleven revolution when the country's dictator president zine el abidine ben ali was ousted
but marzouki warned that essebsi would bring back authoritarian policies
the fact that the elections considered legitimate took place at all is historic
the election process began in october with a vote for parliament
at a time when hopes of moving towards political reform and accountable governments elsewhere in the arab world have been dashed tunisia is the only country where the aspirations of the arab uprisings may yet be fulfilled in the near future anthony dworkin of the european council on foreign relations wrote at the time
on saturday the economist declared tunisia its country of the year
the idealism engendered by the arab spring has mostly sunk in bloodshed and extremism with a shining exception
tunisia the magazine wrote

its economy is struggling and its polity is fragile
but tunisia's pragmatism and moderation have nurtured hope in a wretched region and a troubled world
mabrouk tunisia
the revolutions that spread throughout the arab world began in tunisia when a poor twenty six year old who could not find a job had a run in with police and then set himself on fire in front of a government building in december two thousand and ten

pope francis has unleashed a blistering critique of the vatican bureaucracy or curia criticizing its illnesses ranging from the disease of feeling immortal to vainglory and excessive planning
in his annual christmas address to the curia at the vatican monday the pontiff warned that a church that doesn't try to improve is like a sick body
francis said suggested that it would be helpful to the vatican bureaucrats to have a catalog of their illnesses beginning with this disease of feeling immortal or indispensable
the pathology of power he said could lead to people believing they are superior to others and not here for the service to others
francis warned against the disease of loss of compassion which he said afflicted those who have a heart of stone
those who lose their inner serenity their vivacity and audacity to hide behind their papers becoming like procedural machines rather than men of god
this is dangerous to lose human sensitivity so necessary in order to cry with those who cry and enjoy with those who enjoy the pope said
pope francis referred to the diseases of excessive planning and functionalism and of bad coordination which he said could occur when members did not collaborate with each other
there was also the risk of succumbing to spiritual alzheimer's disease and forgetting the story of salvation he said warning that sufferers lost memory of their encounter with god
the pope described the diseases of rivalry and vainglory and rebuked those who try to court their superiors inspired by their own egotism
the disease of gossip francis said he had addressed before but insufficiently
this is a serious disease that begins simply when people chatter and it takes over the person turning the person as a satan and in so many cases people are speaking ill about their own colleagues and brothers and sisters
these people haven't got the courage to speak directly and they speak about others behind their backs he said
dear brothers let us be aware and guard against the terrorism of gossip
pope francis also appeared to speak to the child abuse scandal that has rocked the catholic church referring to it as the disease of a closeness
this disease also begins from good intentions but with the passing of time enslaves its members becoming a cancer which threatens the harmony of the body and causes a lot of evil and scandal especially towards our small brothers and sisters francis said
finally francis warned against the disease of the mundane of the exhibitionism when the apostle transforms his service in power
this is a disease of people who seek tirelessly to multiply power only aimed at calumny and to defame and discredit others he said
pope francis concluded
dear brothers such diseases and such temptations are a naturally a danger for each christian and for each curia
for each community for any ecclesiastical movement
they can damage both individually and the community
we have to say that only the holy spirit and the soul of christ only he can protect us from the disease
we have to cure ourselves of these
let us try to grow together and close to christ
in an interview with cnn's christiane amanpour that aired earlier this month veteran vatican watcher marco politi said pope francis had been encountering growing opposition within his own church
this was mainly due to francis efforts at reform since becoming pope in march two thousand and thirteen politi said
within the church there is a tough group of conservative bishops and priests and cardinals and also very traditionalist bishops and cardinals who are practically against the pope who are working against the pope he said
they don't like what he wanted to do with the synod about family to give new possibilities to remarried and divorced people to get the communion or to have a new look on the homosexual union

bishops will be held accountable for not protecting youths



now picture thirty three thousand people living there within the space of one city block
that was kowloon walled city once considered the densest settlement on earth
before it was demolished twenty years ago photographer greg girard spent years with collaborator ian lambot documenting this unique hong kong phenomenon and remembers being amazed when he first saw it
it was a huge monstrosity of buildings recalls girard
it didn't look like anything else
after all the walled city was a kind of historical accident
a former qing dynasty fortress it never fully came under the regulation of the british colonial government in hong kong
as a result its residents were free to build their dwellings as they wished ignoring safety codes
quite often houses were built by building onto the next building punching out walls to use their staircases said girard
a lot of them didn't have access to air or open space because they were enclosed in the center of the structure
deep within the building's darkness a variety of small businesses flourished
the places that stuck out were the meat factories says girard
there were pig carcasses laying splayed out on the floor
they'd burn the hair off with a blowtorch it was all pretty open and of course there were no health laws governing the place
but despite the city's wild appearance the photographer found that the people inside lived just like people anywhere else
people were doing very ordinary things he says
it's just that all these ordinary things were happening in an extraordinary place
the complexity of the walled city also fascinated local architect aaron tan now the director of hong kong firm research architecture design
a graduate student then he wrote his thesis on the walled city as it was being torn down
i was fascinated it was like a piece of machinery that worked very well
the demolition was like taking the machine apart the first time you could see what was inside
it was a really humbling process for me as a designer when we met this walled city we started to see that people could be more intelligent than us the designers that they could think of ways to solve problems that are outside the traditional academic world
tan was especially impressed by kowloon walled city's water system
to support its dense population residents dug extra wells and built thousands of pipes that twisted through the building
but since pumping water to the city's roof tanks required plenty of power the people would take turns conserving electricity so that water could be shared successfully
it revealed the community inside that no matter the challenges they would find some intelligent way to solve it says tan
despite the ingenuity of the walled city by one thousand nine hundred and ninety four it was completely torn down by the city government which was eager to replace the chaotic and unregulated community with a public park
seeing the walled city fall into disuse was sort of melancholic says girard
every city realizes too late to start caring about their architectural heritage it's a mistake that gets repeated everywhere
by the time you start caring about it it's too late to save it
today visitors to the site of the old walled city will find a placid garden with swaying trees and cloudy ponds
in the park there is a small museum in honor of kowloon walled city
but when you look to the sky and imagine the colossus of hong kong life that once stood it's easy to see that something significant has been lost
cnn travel
why we love the kowloon city neighborhood
the city is not dead
even today the city's legacy lives on
a walled neighborhood called the narrows in the two thousand and five film batman begins was based on kowloon walled city
the city is even a level in the video game call of duty
black ops
because of the continued interest greg girard is working with his fellow kowloon walled city photographer ian lambot to finish a new book of their stunning photographs entitled city of darkness
revisited
you don't want to romanticize a slum you know
because it was that
but it was much more than that
the walled city was a kind of architectural touchstone in terms of what a city can be unplanned self generated unregulated
it was vital and vibrant and every part of it was being used
tan believes the spirit of the walled city continues to pulse through the heart of hong kong itself
go to the peak and look down upon this amazing collection of buildings coming together it's almost like a blown up version of the walled city right 
each building is related to the next building
new programs evolve because of the connections
this organic chaos he says has been an inspiration for his own work
many architects and urban planners like control he says
but people like to get lost in the city
in my design process i always consciously try to allow accidents to allow others to participate to surprise me

once celebrated throughout europe for their beauty pirot carpets graced the walls and floors of serbian royal palaces as well homes of the urban elite
weaved for over four centuries in the town after which they were named pirot once a thriving trade center on the caravan route between east and west they were ceremonially rolled out for state visits and given to foreign dignitaries
however what was a thriving craft practiced by five thousand weavers a century ago is now under threat of extinction with only ten women still keeping the tradition going
pirot carpet weaving is our treasure which is passed on from generation to generation
it's the knowledge i learned from my mother and my grandmother says slavica ciric who founded the lady's heart cooperative in pirot with local women in two thousand and nine to try to stop the skills nurtured throughout centuries from passing into oblivion
carpet weaving is in our dna she continues
we were born on carpets and we grew up in houses filled with pirot carpets
pirot carpets are very thin but extremely dense and are said to last more than a century
they have two identical sides and are geographically protected which means that they can only be made in the pirot area and out of pirot sheep a rare breed with only a few flocks counting just two hundred and fifty sheep remaining
weaving is painstaking work
it requires geometrical precision supreme skill and creativity in equal measure
everything is done by hand only and in the same way as hundreds of years ago
it takes two weavers working simultaneously a month to create less than one square meter
traditionally a female activity young girls would start at the loom at the age of ten practicing every day for five years to reach a level considered good enough
their weaving skill had a great impact on their marriage prospects it was considered a measure of intelligence because of the knowledge of mathematics required to calculate the size and distribution of patterns
when you look at a carpet with an untrained eye you can see beautiful colorful patterns but we work out exactly how many of these patterns we can fit within a meter says ciric
we have to be visionaries and use logic to see where these patterns will stop and where the border of the carpet will connect and finish she adds
and if a weaver makes a mistake the carpet is instantly pulled apart even if the work was nearly completed
the concentration necessary for this kind of precise work often means that once a weaver sits down at the loom she loses all sense of time
the pattern in a mysterious way simply possesses her drags her into the depth and she's so taken by her work that everything around her stops
she forgets about the time she surrenders herself to the pattern says ciric
and it's those patterns that give pirot carpets a mystical allure
weavers say they represent ancient symbols which carry magical meanings and can be read as an image alphabet and there are ninety five varieties which weavers have to memorize
it is very mysterious but in every single carpet there is a story which you can read
when i see a carpet i can immediately tell whether it has been made now or in a different period whether it has been made with love or only to be sold says ciric
even though this skill is now practiced only by a handful of women ciric and her fellow weavers from lady's heart are trying to pass it on to the next generation organizing winter courses for schoolchildren including boys
there is a new generation coming along and if we manage to pass on this knowledge to them i think there won't be any danger of this craft dying out says ciric
we are the guardians of the tradition of pirot carpet weaving and we do this with love

a van plowed into shoppers at an outdoor christmas market monday in nantes france injuring at least nine people in addition to the driver police said
four had serious wounds plus the driver police said
the driver stabbed himself twice after the incident but is expected to survive said pierre henry brandet a spokesman for france's interior ministry
french interior minister bernard cazeneuve will head to nantes monday evening to meet with the families of the victims and rescue officials brandet told cnn affiliate bfm tv
the investigation is just beginning he said but so far the nantes prosecutor has said the incident appears to be an isolated case and not a terrorist attack
authorities are investigating a notebook found with the attacker brandet said
it was not immediately clear whether the incident was related to one sunday in dijon france in which witnesses said a man shouting god is great in arabic rammed his vehicle into pedestrians
at least twelve people were injured by that vehicle said police in dijon a city in eastern france
a man has been arrested in connection with the case they said
bfm tv reported that eyewitnesses heard the driver shout the phrase allahu akbar arabic for god is great
on saturday a man stabbed three police officers in central france while allegedly calling out the same phrase
french counterterrorism authorities are investigating that attack
and france's prime minister said earlier monday that his country has never faced as serious a terrorism threat as it does right now
police haven't revealed any possible motives in the vehicle incidents

it's six thirty am and the sun has just risen over the bustling gardens of mbuyoni elementary school in the coastal city of dar es salaam tanzania
on this sunny morning fits of giggles and screeches of laughter fill the hot and humid air as would be expected in most schools around the world
but the source of fun is somewhat less expected farming
i like to grow blackjack fame flower pumpkin leaves and sweet potatoes explains eleven year old zulfa mussa in her native language of kiswahili
mussa is new to the world of agriculture and has enjoyed cultivating her favorite crops this morning
i didn't know they were edible and now i know i eat them
in fact she eats them for lunch along with the rest of her school
mussa's school is putting african traditions back on the menu in a new era of indigenous school meals
plants native to her home country tanzania are being harnessed as a result of an idea pioneered by people at the other end of the age spectrum retired women the regent estate senior women's group
modern people here in tanzania associate indigenous food with poverty and being poor says resewo founder freda chale referring to the increasing popularity of fast food
native plants such as blackjack moringa pumpkin sweet potato and even the leaves of these latter two plants have high nutritional and medicinal value
but they're under appreciated by the communities in which they grow often dismissed as weeds
one afternoon in two thousand and seven chale invited her senior peers for tea which was made from the leaves in her garden
that day her mission to save gastronomic traditions began
and it began with children
we started working with schools to make sure youngsters grow up valuing these vegetables says fabia schundia a resewo founding member
the children learn by growing and cultivating the plants at school and go on to spread the word to their families and communities
they don't know most of the time especially people living in towns
the elementary school at mbuyoni has over one thousand two hundred students all of whom appear to have come in at the crack of dawn to tend eagerly to their crops
there are groups of children tilling land whilst others collect water from the well or wander around with watering cans
a final few harvest leaves and roots to be eaten for lunch that day
this is the atmosphere every morning i'm told
the garden spans one sixth of the school's land and began development over three years ago
the school also has a kitchen on site for immediate preparation of the freshly plucked ingredients
in the morning session normally we have time to clean the environment and take care of our garden says school headmistress dorothy malecela
she has seen the impact the garden has had on the general health and well being of her pupils
it increased school enrollment and reduced dropout because the kids are happy to come in she says
resewo currently works with ten schools in dar es salaam but hopes for the indigenous food movement to spread across the country
the need for improved nutrition
among the eight million children under five years old estimated to be living in tanzania forty two per cent are stunted and sixteen per cent are underweight according to unicef
levels of anemia are also high with rates as high as forty one per cent in adult women
one cause of this is the increasing reliance on staples such as maize and sweet potatoes
another cause is that locals have been eating more food high in fat and sugars such as burgers
plants with higher nutritional value including the leaves of the sweet potato plant seem to have been forgotten
improving diets is a national concern but for the women at resewo their goal is to get people appreciating the food directly under their nose
in the villages most of these vegetables grow as weeds says schundia who worries that people don't even seem to use them when they have nothing to eat
by raising awareness into growing indigenous plants the team hope to get people harnessing these plants as year round sources of food on their doorstep
it's all in the taste
as schundia wanders around the community garden at the resewo headquarters she eagerly shows the tens of vegetable varieties growing there one of her favorite being the bitter leaf
you prepare it wash it cut it in small pieces fry it and season it as you wish
it's very tasty
the leaves can also be consumed in the form of tea
utility and versatility appear to be commonplace
furthermore the leaves of a sweet potato plant are high in protein fiber and minerals such as iron
the more local blackjack plant also contains vitamins and minerals and has traditionally been used as medicine to overcome anemia
insight into these plants and many more have been compiled into a recipe book put together in association with the slow food foundation for biodiversity an italian based ngo promoting environmentally and culturally sustainable agriculture
the nutritional and medicinal value of indigenous plants is being forgotten across the continent and the slow food foundation now work in over ten thousand gardens in africa including resewo's headquarters
the movement to revamp and revitalize ancient plants has begun
it also appears to hold the secret to youth
as schundia explains the health benefits of improved nutrition she grins and asks
how old do you think i am 
without a wrinkle on her face and the energy of someone in their prime she reveals she is seventy four years old
maybe that should be the opener to get anyone hooked

in recent years so much has been going on in the world of commercial aviation that putting together a top ten events forecast has been easy major new airplane programs have been announced airline consolidation has taken place and disputes between china and europe over carbon emissions have held major airplane orders hostage
looking at the year ahead it's a challenge to muster a list of five events likely to grab the general public's attention much less ten
the year two thousand and fifteen is more about program execution
new airplanes from airbus and bombardier are scheduled to enter service in two thousand and fifteen and the airbus a three hundred and fifty xwb scheduled for delivery to its first customer december twenty two will also see its eis in january
boeing's seven hundred and eighty seven s are in a lull
more than two hundred have been delivered and the next version the seven hundred and eighty seven ten isn't scheduled for delivery until two thousand and eighteen
embraer is between airplanes so to speak
its new re engined e jet e two isn't scheduled for delivery until two thousand and eighteen and the current generation e jet marches on
yet even though they do lack the pizzazz of years past there are still a handful of important events and milestones to look forward to in two thousand and fifteen
the airbus a three hundred and twenty neo the new engine option and the bombardier cseries are supposed to enter service in two thousand and fifteen
each is powered by the pratt and whitney geared turbo fan a twenty year research and development gamble that brings pw back into the arena as a major player in single aisle airplane powerplants
supposed to because new airplane programs from airbus boeing and bombardier have been replete with delays
so far the flight testing of the a three hundred and twenty neo which had its first flight in september seems to be going flawlessly but unknowns can emerge
the a three hundred and twenty neo's eis is scheduled for october
for cseries eis of bombardier's bet the company jump into the big leagues with its first mainline jet is an event that was originally supposed to happen in december two thousand and thirteen
then the fourth quarter of two thousand and fourteen
the first flight of the airborne test program didn't happen until september two thousand and thirteen
the planned fourth quarter two thousand and fourteen eis may have been achieved had it not been for a major engine failure of pw's gtf during a ground test in may
the fault was traced to a poorly designed oil seal and not the game changing engine architecture
the entire flight test fleet was grounded for three months while the cause and a fix were identified
had cseries been on time it would have been two years ahead of the a three hundred and twenty neo
now it'll be a toss up as to which airplane enters service first
according to the canadian investment bank aerospace analyst at desjardins cseries should have its eis in october two thousand and fifteen
bombardier will only say the second half of two thousand and fifteen but mtu a major supplier on the cseries pratt and whitney engine narrows this down to the fourth quarter
no matter
eis for two airplanes in the same month or the same quarter or even the same year is a major industry event
for airbus the a three hundred and fifty xwb the response to the boeing seven hundred and eighty seven and the challenge to boeing's flagship seven hundred and seventy seven three hundred er was set to be delivered december twenty two to launch customer qatar airways
the real flow of deliveries and service entry begins in january
more
first look inside the airbus a three hundred and fifty xwb
the price per barrel of oil dropped dramatically in two thousand and fourteen
it'll probably continue to fall in two thousand and fifteen
some believe the price could hit forty dollar a barrel
if so it probably won't stay there for long before rebounding to sixty dollar eighty dollar and maybe back to one hundred dollar
don't expect any order cancellations or deferrals because of lower oil prices
the lower oil prices may give new short term life to some older airplanes like the boeing seven hundred and fifty seven seven hundred and sixty seven seven hundred and seventy seven and seven hundred and forty seven four hundred. and airbus a three hundred six hundred r and early a three hundred and thirty s. but that's about it
don't look for lower airfares driven by cheaper oil either
airline management knows this is a time to reap profits that are elusive in a high oil price environment
as always international air shows are huge industry and media events
this coming year the paris air show is in june and the dubai air show is in november
unlike the air shows of recent years at which airplane program launches were announced the big four airplane manufacturers airbus boeing bombardier embraer have tapped out their new airplane launches
paris and dubai will focus more on commercial airplane orders than anything else and even these are expected to be off compared with previous years
the peak of the order cycle has come and gone and for the moment we're on the downside of the bell curve especially with oil prices falling and reducing the urgency to place more orders
besides with airbus and boeing backlogs out to two thousand and twenty there are few slots available for which to place orders
atr the france based turbo prop manufacturer with more than eighty percents of the market might announce a major upgrade of its venerable atr forty two seventy two series with a new engine new wing and other systems but turbo props command neither the market size nor the headlines of the big jets
an atr new engine option while important to the airlines won't capture the imagination of the air show or reporters
comac's c nine hundred and nineteen the challenger to the airbus a three hundred and twenty and boeing seven hundred and thirty seven families is in development and so is the equivalent irkut mc twenty one but neither will take to the skies in two thousand and fifteen
the avic comac arj twenty one is supposed to enter service in two thousand and fifteen after a seven year delay and this time it actually might do so
but only a few have been sold outside of china and prospects that there will be more orders are dim
the airplane is largely a learning effort by the chinese on how to develop an airliner and the experience has been painful
the mitsubishi mrj ninety japan's first commercial airliner since the one thousand nine hundred and sixty s is set to enter flight testing in two thousand and fifteen
more
after fifty years japan set to launch a new commercial passenger plane
the real aerospace geek will watch for the flight testing of the boeing kc forty six a aerial refueling tanker for the u.s. air force
the airplane based on the commercial boeing seven hundred and sixty seven two hundred er is already late and approaching one point five billion dollar over budget
its first flight was supposed to be last fall
now it's planned for this spring
or maybe before
even boeing and the air force aren't sure when the bird will fly
boeing won the contract in a bitter bitter fight with airbus which proposed its a three hundred and thirty mrtt
although not without its own challenges the mrtt is in service in britain and australia and has been ordered by several other global air forces

as part of the most significant diplomatic breakthrough between the united states and cuba in more than fifty years a prisoner swap was made
to uphold its part of the bargain the u.s. released three cuban spies including gerardo hernandez the head of the spy ring known as the wasp network
hernandez had an ear to ear smile wednesday as he arrived at havana's jose marti international airport
state tv showed hernandez as he was greeted by president raul castro and then embraced and kissed his wife adriana perez
cubans watching the nonstop coverage of the prisoner swap were shocked when the cameras zeroed in on hernandez hugging perez
she was obviously in the late stages of a pregnancy that had no easy explanation
not only had hernandez been serving a double life sentence but his wife also worked for cuba's intelligence services and was banned by u.s. officials from visiting her husband in prison according to the cuban government
the subject became the immediate hot topic in havana where rumors swirled fast about the baby's paternity and whether the cuban government could have somehow arranged a clandestine conjugal visit under the nose of u.s. authorities
the couple appeared at another event on saturday where together with the other freed spies castro and the communist island's top political and military officials showered them with applause
a beaming hernandez stood by perez whose round stomach was clearly visible for viewers of the live broadcast
as the couple left the celebration hernandez hinted at the secret surrounding the pregnancy
everyone's asking and we have had a lot of fun with the comments and speculations
the reality is it had to be kept quiet hernandez told the government run television channel
we can't give a lot of details because we don't want to hurt people who meant well
he said his wife's pregnancy was a direct result of the high level talks
one of the first things accomplished by this process was this hernandez said gesturing to his perez's stomach
i had to do it by remote control but everything turned out well
two sources involved with the diplomatic talks when questioned by cnn uncloaked the mystery
during the negotiations hernandez's sperm was collected and sent to cuba where perez was artificially inseminated
the u.s. justice department confirmed the story without going into the details
we can confirm the united states facilitated mrs. hernandez's request to have a baby with her husband spokesman brian fallon said
what the u.s. would gain
why would the u.s. government do this 
the artificial insemination was made possible in exchange for better conditions for alan gross a u.s. contractor imprisoned in cuba
gross was released last week as part of the prisoner swap
in light of mr. hernandez's two life sentences fallon said the request was passed along by senator patrick leahy who was seeking to improve the conditions for mr
gross while he was imprisoned in cuba
the discretion on both sides makes sense
for eighteen months officials from both countries refused to admit that they were even holding high level talks
officials communicated via back channels knowing that any leak about the talks could doom the talks
impregnating perez involved cutting through bureaucratic red tape at multiple u.s. government agencies
as perez began to show officials from both countries fretted over how they would explain her pregnancy and what to do if the baby arrived before the talks succeeded
hernandez was convicted in two thousand and one of conspiracy to commit murder for his role in the brothers to the rescue shoot down that left four cuban americans dead after cuban air force migs blew up the two civilian planes as they flew toward havana to distribute anti government leaflets
he received two life sentences
cuban authorities said hernandez and the other operatives were trying to prevent terrorist attacks from being carried out on their homeland by violent miami exiles
that the u.s. government helped a man convicted of plotting the murder of four cuban americans and spying on the exile community in miami will likely further rankle many of the same cuban americans who were already furious that washington is restoring diplomatic relations with havana
but tim reiser an aide to leahy who worked to broker the landmark agreement with cuba said helping hernandez conceive a child led to better treatment for gross by cuban authorities and was an important concession to help reach a historic deal
the expectation was that this man would die in prison
this was her only chance of having a child rieser told cnn
gerardo hernandez said he and his wife are expecting their baby daughter to arrive in two weeks and they will name her gema

mosul iraq's second largest city was taken by isis in a blitzkrieg like sweep in june
todenhoefer managed to visit the mosque there where the leader of isis abu bakr al bagdadi gave his only public address
and he saw the realities of daily life under isis with all shops having to close for prayers in the middle of the day
there is an awful sense of normalcy in mosul todenhoefer said in an exclusive interview with cnn
one hundred and thirty thousand christians have been evicted from the city the shia have fled many people have been murdered and yet the city is functioning and people actually like the stability that the islamic state has brought them
nonetheless he says there is an air of fear among residents
of course many of the them are quite scared because the punishment for breaking the islamic state's strict rules is very severe
according to isis's leadership the group's fighters managed to take mosul with only about three hundred men even though more than twenty thousand iraqi army soldiers were stationed there when the attack was launched
todenhoefer spoke with several isis fighters who took part in the operation
it took us about four days to take mosul a young fighter told him
so you were only about three hundred men and you defeated twenty thousand troops in four days 
todenhoefer asked
well we didn't attack them all at once we hit their front lines hard also using suicide attacks
then the others fled very quickly the fighter explained
we fight for allah they fight for money and other things that they do not really believe in
todenhoefer told cnn the enthusiasm the isis militants showed was one thing that stood out
when we stayed at their recruitment house there were fifty new fighters who came every day todenhoefer said
and i just could not believe the glow in their eyes
they felt like they were coming to a promised land like they were fighting for the right thing
these are not stupid people
one of the people we met had just finished his law degree he had great job offers but he turned them down to go and fight
we met fighters from europe and the united states
one of them was from new jersey
can you imagine a man from new jersey traveling to fight for the islamic state 
he went on to say that one of isis's main points of strength is their fighters willingness even their will to die on the battlefield
todenhoefer met one somewhat overweight recruit in a safe house who said he wears a suicide belt to every battle because he is too chubby to run away if he is cornered and would choose to blow himself up rather than be captured
isis also has a track record of abusing torturing and executing prisoners of war
todenhoefer was briefly able to speak to a kurdish captive while in mosul
the captive claimed he had not been tortured but todenhoefer said he found that hard to believe
this was a broken man todenhoefer said
it was very sad to see a person in this state
he was just very weak and very afraid of his captors
todenhoefer conducted the interview with the prisoner while several isis fighters stood guard
he asked the man whether he knew what would happen to him
i do not know the captive told him
my family does not even know i am still alive
i hope that maybe there will be some sort of prisoner exchange
todenhoefer was also taken to see child soldiers outfitted with islamic state gear and brandishing ak forty seven s. one of the boys seemed very young but claimed he had already gone to battle for isis
how old are you 
todenhoefer asked
i am thirteen years old the boy replied though he looked even younger than that
one of the most remarkable episodes of todenhoefer's trip to the isis controlled region came when he was able to conduct an interview with a german fighter who spoke on behalf of isis's leadership
the man clearly unapologetic about the group's transgressions vowed there was more to come
he also issued a warning to europe and the united states
so you also want to come to europe 
todenhoefer asked him
no we will conquer europe one day the man said
it is not a question of if we will conquer europe just a matter of when that will happen
but it is certain
for us there is no such thing as borders
there are only front lines
our expansion will be perpetual
and the europeans need to know that when we come it will not be in a nice way
it will be with our weapons
and those who do not convert to islam or pay the islamic tax will be killed
todenhoefer asked the fighter about their treatment of other religions especially shia muslims
what about the one hundred and fifty million shia what if they refuse to convert 
todenhoefer asked
one hundred and fifty million two hundred million or five hundred million it does not matter to us the fighter answered
we will kill them all
the interview became testy when they reached the topic of beheadings and enslavement especially of female captives
so do you seriously think that beheadings and enslavement actually signal progress for humanity 
todenhoefer asked
slavery absolutely signals progress the man said
only ignorant people believe that there is no slavery among the christians and the jews
of course there are woman who are forced into prostitution under the worst circumstances
i would say that slavery is a great help to us and we will continue to have slavery and beheadings it is part of our religion
many slaves have converted to islam and have then been freed
the isis spokesman blamed the beheading of captured western journalists and aid workers on the policies of the united states
people should really think about the case of james foley he said
he did not get killed because we started the battle
he got killed because of the ignorance of his government that did not give him any help
even with recent gains by kurdish forces against isis in northern iraq todenhoefer sees the extremist group as entrenched building state institutions and that it shows no sign of losing its grip in the main areas it controls in iraq and syria
i think the islamic state is a lot more dangerous than western leaders realize he said
they believe in what they are fighting for and are preparing the largest religious cleansing campaign the world has ever seen

u.s. officers shot a canadian man who walked toward a border inspection booth waving what they said looked like a handgun early sunday
u.s. customs and border protection said in a statement that the man stopped his car around three a.m. near a booth on the ambassador bridge which goes between detroit and the canadian city of windsor
as he walked toward them with what appeared to be a black handgun the officers ordered him to drop the weapon the statement said
when he pointed it in their direction they opened fire
officials at first said the man they shot had been waving a handgun
but investigators later determined that the man was holding a replica of a handgun u.s. customs and border protection spokesman kris grogan said
authorities have not released the identity of the man who they described as a canadian citizen
he was shot in the arm treated for his injuries and then taken into custody grogan said
citing windsor police cnn partner ctv said the man has had previous encounters with canadian law enforcement and confronted police officers minutes before the shooting on the bridge
after receiving a call reporting a man with a gun in the parking lot of a mcdonald's near the border around two forty a.m. windsor police officers arrived at the scene and ordered the man to drop his weapon police said
according to police the man said why haven't you shot me yet 
then he got back in his vehicle and drove away
the department of homeland security's office of the inspector general u.s customs and border protection's office of internal affairs and the detroit police are investigating

editor's note
errol louis is the host of inside city hall a nightly political show on ny one a new york all news channel
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author
we don't yet know what polluted swamp of mental sickness led ismaaiyl brinsley to embark on a multistate rampage that culminated with the barbaric execution style killing of nypd officers wenjian liu and rafael ramos on a new york city street
but the madman's actions could not have happened at a worse time for a city already embroiled in a bitter public battle over police community relations
it's very possible that an important debate about race policing and the proper use of force will be buried along with the martyred officers
weeks of street protests over a grand jury's decision not to indict police officers who killed eric garner along with mayor bill de blasio's statements in sympathy with the goals of the demonstrators had already antagonized police unions
even before the slaying of the officers a war of words between de blasio and union leaders had grown strikingly bitter prompting new york's most prominent cleric cardinal timothy dolan to publicly call on both sides to ratchet down the rhetoric
the call for civility hadn't yielded much in the way of results the unions continued to bash the mayor and a street demonstration earlier this month for the first time turned violent with a pair of police officers beaten on the brooklyn bridge
it's not a time for political analysis said a somber de blasio at a press conference saturday shortly after meeting with the families of the slain officers
the mayor appeared shaken in part because while entering the hospital where the dead officers bodies lay he passed through a cordon of dozens of officers who pointedly turned their backs on him instead of saluting
de blasio's call for a temporary halt to political warfare didn't stop his adversaries from going on the attack
typical of the criticism was a twitter message from former gov
george pataki a republican who has been floating trial balloons about a possible run for president
pataki pronounced himself sickened by these barbaric acts which sadly are a predictable outcome of divisive anti cop rhetoric of eric holder and mayor de blasio
the statement is farfetched to say the least
neither pataki nor anybody outside the psychiatric profession has the slightest idea why brinsley shot his girlfriend traveled hundreds of miles to new york randomly killed two policemen and then took his own life
boldly claiming that the mayor and attorney general led brinsley to murder by mere words raises a question pataki can't possibly answer
which speeches exactly made it all happen 
an even harsher tone came from police union leaders
there is blood on many hands tonight said the president of the patrolmen's benevolent association patrick lynch
those that incited violence on the street in the guise of protest that tried to tear down what new york city police officers did every day
we tried to warn it must not go on it shouldn't be tolerated
that blood on the hands starts on the steps of city hall in the office of the mayor
watching the turmoil on television you'd never know that new york is on track to register the lowest number of murder and other serious crimes since the city began tracking numbers in the one thousand nine hundred and sixty s. the city has never been safer but rarely has it seemed so divided and angry
both sides are guilty of excess and poor judgment
lynch's fulminations about legitimate policy differences have been destructively overheated the new york daily news said in a recent editorial condemning the union president for circulating a form officers can complete that asks de blasio not to attend their funerals if they end up killed in the line of duty
the mayor who has openly supported the sentiment of demonstrators protesting the police killing of garner made mistakes of his own
de blasio should have issued a harsh rebuke to activists who recently marched through the streets chanting shoot back
and what do we want 
dead cops
the mayor should have agreed to lynch's demand that protest leaders loudly and publicly disavow such violent rhetoric
can things get worse 
yes they can
in one thousand nine hundred and ninety two cops upset at then mayor david dinkins staged a rally at city hall that turned into a near riot with ten thousand officers taking over a bridge tramping on cars and booing and cursing at superior officers and elected officials
we haven't reached that point in new york yet
but these are dark troubled times in an urban center where twenty years of dedicated effort by police and community have mostly conquered the true common enemy the city's criminals who are surely enjoying the discord that allows them to thrive in our divided city

these seemingly innocuous questions have snowballed into a bitter polemic on the catholic altar where a battle of aesthetic titans has ensued
religious scholars versus the so called starchitects who have earned multimillion dollar contracts to build megachurches for the new millennium
to arbitrate italian photographer andrea di martino looked to find meaning in these newly built houses of god
i wanted to photograph new but already established churches from this millennium
but i had to explain to a lot of people that i wasn't documenting the demise of the catholic church or even the loss of churchgoers but how these churches have now become part of the establishment he said
from turin to rome di martino zigzagged through cities where celebrity architects hoped their designs would add to italy's great architectural landscape
photographing the works of architectural giants such as paolo portoghesi mario botta richard meier renzo piano and others di martino explored whether there is a historical continuum with the traditions of brunelleschi bernini da vinci and other artistic geniuses whose religious reverence helped build some of the world's greatest monuments
di martino used a formal approach photographing these churches from an egalitarian perspective
his camera takes a centralized position to allow the architectural concepts to get fair play
photography he hoped could translate the aesthetic decisions behind some very controversial and expensive designs that to some people are unrecognizable as churches
in turin which hosts the holy shroud di martino photographed botta's church of santo volto
standing in what was a depressed steelwork factory the church has received endless accolades by design experts around the world
but it has also been criticized by vatican members and religious scholars who say they are extremely materialistic devoid of spiritual references and divorced from the catholic dogma
at the other end of the discussion these new architects are building a new vision for the future
botta's work is often called revolutionary and genius and some have put it in the company of le corbusier and niemeyer
the crux of the issue
is there a continuum with the past 
does it follow the catholic church's norms defined by decree for what is a church 
in an online interview botta acknowledged the struggle
to build a church nowadays is to come face to face with millenary history and whether i like it or not i find myself these historical issues he said
di martino said that when he stood outside photographing these churches he rarely got a positive response
i know you can't build baroque churches today but there is definitely a disconnect between the populace and the ideas of these architects di martino said
the big issue is that we are in search of a model that can represent our era
and we haven't found one
vatican officials have lashed out against what they see as a diversion from dictates on how to build a church according to catholic liturgy
these laws however have been subject to interpretation
the diocese of turin for instance defends its decision to stand by botta's design claiming it adheres to catholic dogma on aesthetics
the seven tower church with skylights is a symbolic play on the use of natural light in ritual and divinity
the industrial looking church complex blends in with the area associated with turin's working class
to the common eye these towers may seem more like giant chimneys a reference to the industrial working class area
photographing inside this monumental building is a different story
liturgical tradition is referenced but only slightly
di martino photographs the pixelated image of the holy face a half cross by the altar every element illuminated by natural light
a possible allusion that god is omnipresent in the digital age 
in rome meier was tasked to build a church in the city's somewhat derelict outskirts of rome in an area called tor tre teste
perched like a white pearl amid tired tower blocks and parking lots meier's jubilee church is simple and reflects light like other meier buildings
it is a clean clear cut design
but where is the recognizable iconography and other elements that help situate catholics in this era of rationalist architecture 
di martino who said his style is really photojournalism has great interest in social issues
photographing modern buildings makes sense in his body of work he said
i approach architecture in the same way
i am interested in how man is placed in this design even though i photograph these buildings without people he said
they are not there but i still like to narrate their story

more than one point seven million children in conflict torn areas of eastern ukraine face an extremely serious situation the u.n. children's agency has warned with their suffering exacerbated by harsh winter weather
many families have been forced from their homes and lack access to safe water sanitation and schooling
children continue to bear the brunt of this conflict with schooling disrupted and access to basic services limited said marie pierre poirier unicef regional director for central and eastern europe and central asia
she called for extra resources to be provided to those in need
extremely harsh winter conditions have made the impact of the crisis more acute she said
government forces and pro russia rebels have been battling for control of eastern donetsk and luhansk regions since april after russia annexed ukraine's southeastern crimea region the previous month
according to a unicef press release friday one hundred and forty seven schools have been closed in parts of the donetsk region where fighting is ongoing disrupting the education of about fifty thousand children since september one
while some schools are in ruins others are closed because of safety concerns
in government controlled areas one hundred and eighty seven educational institutions in total have been damaged or destroyed unicef said
the closures mean that besides lessons children are missing out on the stability and routine that can be provided by school at a time of crisis helping to alleviate their stress the agency said
it's not just those still living in conflict areas who are affected
since march more than one million people have been displaced by the fighting including nearly five hundred and thirty thousand within ukraine
of those at least one hundred and thirty thousand are children according to unicef
in many cases they are not attending a new school because their parents have not registered them anticipating further displacement or planning to return home
unicef says it needs thirty two point four million dollar to meet the urgent humanitarian needs of six hundred thousand children and their families in ukraine
the funds would help provide access to schooling
enable support to reduce children's high levels of stress
pay for polio vaccines
and ensure two hundred and fifty thousand children and women get safe water and hygiene supplies to prevent outbreaks of disease
the agency has received nine point four million dollar in funding and pledges to date
amid the fighting at least forty four children have been killed in ukraine this year according to the agency
while ukraine's civilian population suffers there is little sign of progress in reaching a diplomatic resolution to the crisis
western powers accuse russia of sending troops and equipment to help the separatists in their fight against ukrainian government forces and have imposed repeated rounds of economic sanctions against russian interests in a bid to put pressure on moscow
but president vladimir putin appears to have little appetite to repair relations with the west despite his country's tanking economy
putin told reporters gathered in moscow on thursday that his country was ready to mediate in the ukraine crisis
he also denied that russians killed in ukraine were members of his country's military repeating the long standing russian line that any russians fighting in ukraine were volunteers
a ceasefire deal was reached september five in minsk belarus after talks between representatives of ukraine's government russia and rebel leaders in eastern ukraine
a subsequent agreement on september nineteen in minsk set out more measures
but fighting in ukraine has since resumed with a british security official last month telling cnn that the conflict had returned to levels that preceded the ceasefire
military spokesman andriy lysenko said during a televised briefing friday that five ukrainian soldiers had been killed and seven wounded in the past twenty four hours
militants including snipers fired on ukrainian positions using rifles and small arms said lysenko

pakistani security forces said they killed several taliban insurgents in and around peshawar on saturday four days after taliban gunmen massacred scores of children the northwestern city
at least five militants including a key commander were killed saturday in a battle between security forces and militants in the mattani area of peshawar sources said
in addition at least two suspected militants and two police officers were killed in charsadda a suburb of peshawar sources said
on friday the pakistani military said it killed thirty two militants in khyber pakhtunkhwa province of which peshawar is the capital
a military statement didn't specify whether any of those killed were taliban members or whether the ambush was linked to tuesday's deadly school attack in which one hundred and forty five people including one hundred and thirty two children were killed
the school massacre prompted widespread revulsion across pakistan
prime minister nawaz sharif responded by announcing an end to a moratorium on the death penalty in terrorism cases
the pakistani taliban known as the tehreek e taliban pakistan said they targeted a school which mostly admits soldiers children because the students aspired to follow in their fathers footsteps and target militants
they also said it was revenge for the killing of hundreds of innocent tribesmen and their children during a recent offensive by pakistan's military
the pakistani army has been conducting a ground offensive aimed at clearing out taliban and other militants in the loosely governed tribal areas of northwestern pakistan
the campaign has displaced tens of thousands of people
drone strike kills five in north waziristan sources say
in one of those tribal areas saturday a drone strike killed five suspected militants including someone who might be a high value target pakistani intelligence sources said
missiles stuck a compound in the datakhel region of north waziristan killing the suspects the sources said speaking on condition of anonymity
the suspects identities had yet to be confirmed and the sources didn't say which group or groups the militants represented
north waziristan is one of the northwestern pakistan tribal areas bordering afghanistan that have long been a base for anti government militants
the pakistani taliban which have close ties with their namesake in afghanistan have long taken credit for an extensive list of assaults on civilians and security forces in pakistan
the attack on schoolchildren however was repellent even in the eyes of other militant groups in the region
a spokesman for the afghan taliban condemned the peshawar school attack because it involved the deliberate killing of innocent people women and children
osama mehmood a spokesman for al qaeda's affiliate in india similarly condemned the attack blasting it as being against sharia or islamic law
our hearts are tearing apart with pain at the killing of innocent children he said in a statement
the fighters of al qaeda in the indian subcontinent condole the death of these children
our target is not innocent civilians women and children instead we are responsible for their protection



the u.n. high commissioner for refugees said friday it had credible reports that at least two hundred and fifty six people including children had been killed in ax and machete attacks since october in the beni area of north kivu province
multiple attacks over the last three months have caused widespread fear and displacement
we are appealing for humanitarian access to help people in distress unhcr spokesman adrian edwards told reporters in geneva
on tuesday human rights watch also sounded the alarm saying its interviews with victims and witnesses indicated unidentified rebel fighters had killed at least one hundred and eighty four civilians though the actual number is likely significantly higher and injured many others in attacks on villages in beni territory
about eighty eight thousand people have been forced from their homes in beni and the surrounding area with some finding shelter with families while others seek sanctuary in schools or churches unhcr said
the violence has also spread northward into orientale province the agency said
meanwhile more attacks have been threatened prompting frightened villagers to flee again toward larger towns and cities the unhcr said
the survivors and the displaced live in a desperate situation and in constant fear
they remain at risk of new attacks and have had no respite for the past three months
they have little protection against violence and have received hardly any assistance edwards said
people need shelter basic aid items clean drinking water and access to health services and schools he said
aid projects have been suspended because of the violence of particular concern where disease is already rife
the unhcr called on the government to protect civilians and ensure humanitarian organizations safe access to beni and the surrounding areas
human rights watch urged government forces and the u.n. peacekeeping force in dr congo monusco to work together to restore stability and to identify those behind the violence
large scale rebel attacks occurring nearly weekly have terrorized residents of beni and left them uncertain where to seek safety said ida sawyer senior congo researcher at human rights watch
un and congolese forces need to urgently coordinate their efforts and improve protection of civilians in beni
human rights watch cited u.n. and congolese army officials as saying they believe the recent attacks were carried out by the allied democratic forces a ugandan led islamist rebel group that has been active in beni territory since one thousand nine hundred and ninety six
beni is located near the border with uganda
in mid october monusco chief martin kobler called for decisive joint military actions by the u.n. peacekeeping force and the dr congo's military to start as soon as possible in order to relieve the population from the terror imposed by the adf once and for all
this sequence of violence killings assassinations and human rights violations in beni territory needs to stop immediately he said speaking after a visit to beni to pay tribute to the victims of previous suspected adf attacks
radio okapi a radio network operated in dr congo by monusco and the fondation hirondelle a swiss nongovernmental organization quoted gen. jean baillaud of the monusco force as saying wednesday that it must do more to protect local people as it combats adf rebels in the beni area alongside the dr congo military
baillaud acknowledged that the u.n. force could improve in terms of coordination and the swiftness of its response
he said political efforts not just military were also needed to resolve the situation
the eastern part of dr congo has been embroiled in violence since one thousand nine hundred and ninety four when hutu forces crossed the border from rwanda fearing reprisals following the genocide there

north korea is accusing the u.s. government of being behind the making of the movie the interview
and in a dispatch on state media the totalitarian regime warned the united states that its citadels will be attacked dwarfing the hacking attack on sony that led to the cancellation of the film's release
while steadfastly denying involvement in the hack north korea accused u.s. president barack obama of calling for symmetric counteraction
the dprk has already launched the toughest counteraction
nothing is more serious miscalculation than guessing that just a single movie production company is the target of this counteraction
our target is all the citadels of the u.s. imperialists who earned the bitterest grudge of all koreans a report on state run kcna read
our toughest counteraction will be boldly taken against the white house the pentagon and the whole u.s. mainland the cesspool of terrorism the report said adding that fighters for justice including the guardians of peace a group that claimed responsibility for the sony attack are sharpening bayonets not only in the u.s. mainland but in all other parts of the world
the fbi on friday pinned blame on north korea for a hack into sony's computer systems
in an interview broadcast sunday on cnn obama called it an act of cybervandalism not war
he said the united states is going to review whether to put north korea back on a list of states that sponsor terrorism
we've got very clear criteria as to what it means for a state to sponsor terrorism
and we don't make those judgments just based on the news of the day obama said
we look systematically at what's been done and based on those facts we'll make those determinations in the future
the republican national committee urged cinema chains to show the movie
in a letter to their ceos rnc chairman reince priebus wrote
as a sign of my commitment if you agree to show this movie i will send a note to the republican party's millions of donors and supporters urging them to buy a ticket not to support one movie or hollywood but to show north korea we can not be bullied into giving up our freedom
while the film was the work of private individuals north korea insisted otherwise in its statement
the dprk has clear evidence that the u.s. administration was deeply involved in the making of such dishonest reactionary movie it said
the interview is a comedy with plans for an attempted assassination of north korean leader kim jong un a central plot point
in a cnn interview on friday sony entertainment ceo michael lynton said the studio had not given in to pressure from hackers and was still considering ways to distribute the movie
but that's not what the company initially said after canceling the film's release
on wednesday night a studio spokesperson said simply sony pictures has no further release plans for the film
but in its latest statement released sunday the company said
no decisions have been made
sony is still exploring options for distribution

the controversial auction held inside the dallas convention center on a chilly saturday evening in january sparked a contentious debate over the best way to protect the species that has been brought to the edge of extinction because of humans appetite for its horn which is used for daggers ornaments and in asia traditional medicine
the auction became so heated that both knowlton and the auction organizers feared for their safety after receiving strings of death threats that were investigated by the fbi
the dallas safari club sponsored the auction and billed it as a fundraising effort to help save the endangered species in africa
biggame dot org and knowlton said the auction was done in the name of conservation to save the threatened black rhinoceros
all proceeds were to be donated to the namibian government and earmarked for conservation and anti poaching efforts according to club officials and the namibian ministry of environment and tourism
animal welfare groups strongly oppose the auction's conservation approach and call the kill it to save it rationale misguided and outrageous
in spring knowlton applied for a permit from the u.s
fish and wildlife service that would enable him to import the trophy parts of the animal's body at the completion of the hunt in namibia
the hunt would be organized and overseen by the namibian authorities
in my opinion i thought it would have happened by now knowlton told cnn in an exclusive interview when asked if he was surprised that the permit process has taken so long
knowlton said he is waiting to see what will happen with the permit request before he makes his decision whether to move forward with the hunt
namibia wants us to come and participate in the hunt desperately knowlton said
the entire point of the auction in the united states was to be able to import the carcass the remains of the black rhino into the united states
that's why they had the auction here in the hopes that it would bring more money to conservation than the previous permits they have sold in namibia
in addition to importing the rhino trophy knowlton also plans to distribute the rhino meat to namibian villages after the hunt
the endangered species act requires the u.s
fish and wildlife service to determine that the import will enhance the species survival and not be detrimental to the survival of the species
the act also requires that any federally authorized activity may not jeopardize the continued survival of the species in any way
the service looks closely at the individual circumstances of each import application including the biology of the species its current status in and beyond the country where the hunt will take place and the threats it may be facing as well as the overall management program for the species in that country where the funds for the hunt will go and how they will be used said gavin shire chief of public affairs for the u.s
fish and wildlife service
the u.s
fish and wildlife service said it received over fifteen thousand public comments opposing the permit in the thirty day allocated comment period on its federal register which closed on december eight
many of the comments were identical or near identical form letters arguing to save the last of the black rhinos
from american trophy hunter's greed and vanity 
shire said all the comments will be examined for substantive information and was unable to provide a time frame for when the service will make a decision on the permit
animal conservationists estimate there are five thousand black rhinos in the world about two thousand and twenty of which are in the southern africa nation
they are considered a critically endangered species by wildlife organizations around the world
dr. michael knight chairman of the international union for conservation of nature african and asian rhino specialist groups said the namibian black rhino populations have been performing very well growing at a very healthy seven percents per year thanks to conservation efforts
in population terms it's of minor significance as we are talking about one old bull that would have contributed genetically to the rhino population already
in monetary terms it's important as it generates funds that go directly into the wildlife products fund that feeds one hundred percents back into rhino conservation knight said
knowlton stressed that the rhinos picked for hunting have no benefit to the population at large and are in fact a detriment to the population
the animals chosen are earmarked
at the end of their life
they are not going to help the enhancement of the black rhino species in any way
this way there is a chance that the death of that animal helps the entire species
knowlton said by raising money from hunters like himself the namibian government can use the money for much needed anti poaching resources and habitat enhancement
but sacrificing one animal for the greater good of the endangered species is a move that critics and animal conservation groups call perverse and a sad joke
they need to be protected not sold to the highest bidder said jeffrey flocken of the international fund for animal welfare
it's a farce to say that this is being done for conservation flocken said
it's saying the rarity of this animal is worth more dead than alive
several groups such as flocken's argue it would be better to use these rhinos to promote wildlife viewing and ecotourism by charging people for the experience of seeing one of these ancient beasts up close in the wild
it also sends a dangerous message that these iconic and disappearing animals are worth more as dead trophies to be mounted and hung on a wall in a texas mansion than living in the wild in africa flocken said
namibia was the first african country to incorporate protection of the environment into its constitution and said its conservation program has contributed to it having the largest free roaming population of black rhinos in the world
the dallas safari club obtained the hunting permit from the namibian government which would oversee every aspect of knowlton's expedition
it's the first time a black rhino hunting permit has been auctioned outside the country
in recent years the namibian ministry of environment and tourism which oversees the protection of the black rhinos has allowed three permits a year
in a two thousand and thirteen letter to the dallas safari club the namibian government said to hunt a black rhino is not taken lightly by namibia

only old geriatric bulls which are marginalized in the population and do not contribute to reproduction are trophy hunted
it really is a dilemma 
the biggest threat to these massive beasts is poachers across the african continent
rhino horns are lucrative on the black market
in asia where there are claims it can treat everything from headaches and food poisoning to rheumatism and cancer horns can fetch up to sixty thousand dollar per kilogram putting the value somewhere between gold and pure cocaine
in the one thousand nine hundred and eighty s the black rhino population had dwindled to just a few dozen
conservation efforts have slowly helped increase herd numbers but poachers are still a threat
marcia fargnoli chief executive officer of the save the rhino trust in namibia which works with the government to fight poachers said the group has tried to persuade the namibian government to stop issuing hunting permits
but a poor african country like namibia where the world bank estimates the gross per capita income to be less than six thousand dollar struggles to fund conservation efforts fargnoli said
it's difficult for the government to ignore the chance to raise so much money so quickly
i really believe every rhino counts said fargnoli
it really is a dilemma

but i really struggle to say i'm saving rhinos and then say that one can be hunted
knowlton hosts the hunting show uncharted on the outdoor channel and he also organizes high end hunting adventures around the world
he described himself as a passionate conservationist and stressed that animal lovers should research the facts before having emotional reactions
there is no doubt in his mind that what he is doing is extremely important in helping the black rhino species in the long run
the namibian government is looking at it in a sustainable way
and i believe hunters at large are looking at it as a way to maintain a population in a sustainable way

as australia grapples with another shocking tragedy the deaths of eight children in one home the mother of seven of them might be able to explain what happened
police have charged the thirty seven year old woman in friday's deaths in a suburb of cairns
she faces eight counts of murder queensland police said in a statement
she remains under police guard at a hospital where she is recovering from lacerations authorities said
she appeared before a magistrate in a bedside hearing on sunday
on friday police responded to a report of an injured woman in the northeastern australian city of cairns but found much more than just the wounded mother
inside officers found the bodies of eight children between ages two and fourteen police spokesman bruno asnicar said
the eighth child killed was a niece of the woman asnicar said
australian media reported that at least some of the victims were believed to have been stabbed
but asnicar declined to confirm that saying police are waiting for autopsy reports
charges are being considered
but at this time we haven't filed any charges asnicar told reporters
the children had five fathers who are all shocked and devastated authorities said
the woman's twenty year old son made the gruesome discovery a relative of the family told cnn affiliate seven network
he got off the bus and he found his mother and siblings lisa thaiday said
police said saturday they talked to the twenty year old but that he is not a suspect
distraught neighbors gathered near the area cordoned off around the one story house where christmas decorations were still hanging in the front window
it is so difficult to come to terms with what has happened on a street i have visited so many times among residents i have so often spoken with said gavin king the local member of parliament
cairns is a remote coastal city of about one hundred and fifty thousand residents that's popular with great barrier reef tourists as a jumping off point
the news out of cairns is heartbreaking prime minister tony abbott said in a statement
all parents would feel a gut wrenching sadness at what has happened
this is an unspeakable crime
the discovery of the bodies added to a traumatic week for australia after a deadly hostage taking in sydney
australia was already reeling from a siege at a sydney cafe this week in which two of the hostages were killed along with the gunman who held them captive
these are trying days for our country abbott said
they never annoyed us 
a neighbor of the house where the bodies were found said the family was always quiet
she told cnn affiliate seven network that she'd heard no noise from the house friday as she sat in her front room until the sudden burst of police sirens
another neighbor patricia birch said she heard some arguments on the property around ten a.m. but agreed the family wasn't known for causing problems
they never annoyed us she told the cairns post
they were really good

kurdish peshmerga fighters claimed to take control saturday of sinjar the northern iraqi town that isis militants stormed this summer causing minority yazidis to flee into nearby mountains and spawning a humanitarian crisis
the kurdistan region security council said on twitter that its forces entered sinjar district around one forty five p.m. and just over an hour later succeeded in taking complete control of it and nearby villages
the message ended shingal kurds
shingal is another name for sinjar
the advance is the latest in recent days by kurdish forces against isis which has been blamed for atrocities around the area for its treatment of those by any who resist or don't subscribe to its extremist islamist beliefs
and few if any have gotten worse treatment than the yazidis one of the world's smallest and oldest monotheistic religious minority groups
yazidis most of whom are ethnic kurds revere an angel figure that some muslims believe to be the devil
last summer isis slaughtered yazidis by the hundreds according to vian dakhil the only lawmaker representing the yazidis in iraq's parliament
women in the group were treated like cattle kurdish regional government adviser nazand begikhani said
many were enslaved raped and sold by isis
the town of sinjar became central to this drama when yazidi residents ran for their lives to sinjar mountain just to the north
but they had very little food medical care or water shortages compounded by iraq's intense summer heat
their dire situation as well as the harsh treatment they got from isis simply due to their religious beliefs spurred an international coalition to act
this effort began with the airdrop of supplies to sinjar mountain
rescues came next
and now the u.s. led coalition is waging regular airstrikes targeting isis in iraq and neighboring syria an air campaign that helped pave the way for the recapture of sinjar
this summer's combination of humanitarian and military efforts helped as thousands of yazidis fled on foot to syria
still a few hundred remained on sinjar mountain
and isis never really went away
in fact the tug of war in the region has continued for months prompting a fresh allied onslaught in recent days
tuesday night coalition aircraft conducted forty eight airstrikes near sinjar the heaviest concentration of such airstrikes to date according to two u.s. defense officials
masrour barzani chancellor of the krsc said thursday this ground and air operation helped open
a corridor from south of zummar to the mountain sinjar giving direct access to those displaced on the mountain and in need of aid
isis fighters meanwhile fled toward the syrian border and isis strongholds such as mosul and tal afar the kurdish agency said
the peshmerga are keeping up the heat
a press release saturday from the kurdistan region security council indicated these fighters launched a new phase of the offensive around eight a.m. south of rabia to sinjar mountain
three hours later the krsc claimed its forces had taken complete control of mushrefa but that they weren't done
the objective is to surround and clear an area of approximately two thousand one hundred square kilometers the kurdish agency said
meanwhile humanitarian aid in the form of thirty two truckloads of food water and other needed aid began rolling out saturday morning from irbil bound for sinjar mountain the krsc reported
morale remains high as the peshmerga continue to make advances on both fronts the kurdish agency said

is this the moment the world finally gets to know what really happened in december two thousand and ten when fifa decided to award the two thousand and eighteen world cup to russia and the two thousand and twenty two tournament to qatar 
football's world governing body has decided to publish a redacted version of michael garcia's report into alleged corruption surrounding the bidding process for the tournaments after months of delay and intense criticism
the decision did not require a vote and was unanimously endorsed by fifa's twenty five person executive committee during its two day meeting in marrakech morocco
i have asked the fifa exco to vote in favor of the publication of the two thousand and eighteen two thousand and twenty two inquiry report by the investigatory chamber said fifa president sepp blatter
blatter also insisted that there would not be a re vote on the decision to award the two thousand and eighteen and two thousand and twenty two world cups to russia and qatar respectively
the report is about history and i am focused on the future added blatter while referring to the recommendation made by domenico scala fifa's head of compliance
we will not revisit the two thousand and eighteen and two thousand and twenty two vote and a report by independent external legal experts commissioned by mr. scala supports the view that there are no legal grounds to revoke the executive committee's decision on the award of the two thousand and eighteen and two thousand and twenty two world cups
we are already in the process of incorporating recommendations made by independent experts including the ethics committee for how the fifa world cup selection process can be improved so that everyone can be confident that the two thousand and twenty six bidding process will be fair ethical and open
in a press conference which followed his statement he added
it would really need an earthquake extremely important new elements to go back on this world cup in qatar
fifa says it will confirm the dates for the world cup in qatar at its next executive committee meeting in switzerland in march
it is expected to be held in the winter with fears over the intense heat in the gulf state
meanwhile the report will not be published until current investigations into five individuals are completed and it's expected to be heavily redacted
three members of the committee spain's mara villar llona wowrawi makudi of thailand and belgium's michel d'hooghe were being investigated by garcia for either alleged code breaches during the bidding process or for failing to comply with his probe
harold mayne nicholls who led the inspection team visiting the candidates to host the two thousand and eighteen and two thousand and twenty two tournaments and former german world cup winner franz beckenbauer are also facing charges from the fifa ethics committee which both men have denied
blatter also confirmed that garcia has been replaced by his deputy cornel borbly who he describes as an outstanding lawyer
it is important that the work of the ethics committee continues and that any instances of wrongdoing are fully investigated and their perpetrators pursued and sanctioned said blatter
i have been informed that various cases against individuals for alleged rule violations have been opened by the investigatory chamber and are currently under review by the adjudicatory chamber
the organization fully supports the rigorous pursuit of these cases
and while fifa as an organization does not have prosecutorial powers we have provided information and the full report from mr. garcia to the swiss general attorney's office and have pledged our cooperation
michel platini head of uefa the european governing body also welcomed the decision to publish the report
it was important that the fifa executive committee decided today to publish the garcia report he said on twitter via his spokesman pedro pinto
i have always battled for transparency and this is a step in the right direction
let us hope that the report can now be published as quickly as possible
the credibility of fifa depends on it
the move comes just days after garcia resigned from his role citing a lack of leadership at the top of world football's governing body
garcia quit following fifa's rejection of his appeal after he had launched a complaint about how his report had been summarized by hans joachim eckert fifa's independent ethics judge
i disagree with the appeal committee's decision said the american lawyer now chairman of the investigatory chamber of the fifa ethics committee in a public statement
it now appears that at least for the foreseeable future the eckert decision will stand as the final word on the two thousand and eighteen and two thousand and twenty two fifa world cup bidding process
no independent governance committee investigator or arbitration panel can change the culture of an organization
blatter said he was surprised by garcia's resignation but that the work of the ethics committee will nonetheless continue
pending the election of a new chairman of the ethics committee by the fifa congress the fifa executive committee will appoint an acting chairman to serve as a replacement for mr garcia added blatter who will be at fifa exco's meeting in marrakech on thursday and friday
garcia's decision to leave his role came following months of frustration for the new york attorney
in september when he completed his report he spoke out and declared that it should be made public but with redactions to ensure witness confidentiality was not compromised
fifa rejected his request on the grounds that witness confidentiality for his work could prove difficult to sustain if the report was published and threatened to sanction him for his outburst
then eckert published his summary prompting garcia to respond by saying the german judge's forty two page report contained numerous materially incomplete and erroneous representations
fifa has been under increasing pressure from the media and football fans to publish the report and embrace a period of reform
sponsors such as visa and coca cola have both gone public with their grievances over fifa's lack of transparency while sony will not be renewing its deal when it ends at the end of this year
widespread skepticism over the way russia and qatar won the rights to host the next two tournaments remain despite both countries being cleared of any wrongdoing by eckert's summary
both russia and qatar have always denied they were involved in any wrongdoing during the bidding process
the outcome of the vote is unlikely to hinder blatter's chances of retaining the presidency when the elections are held in may
blatter who is seventy eight is poised to win a fifth term in office and faces little opposition with votes from asia africa and south america already assured
uefa has yet to publicly back a candidate but it has distanced itself from the bid by frenchman jerome champagne the only man to have publicly announced his plan to stand against blatter
frenchman platini the uefa president has ruled out running against blatter but there is now a race against time for his organization to thrown their weight behind a candidate
one option for uefa would be prince ali bin al hussein the jordanian prince who is also a vice president of fifa
al hussein is one of the most forward thinking members of the exco and publicly backed the publishing of the report
yet al hussein could be thwarted by his own confederation by the asian football confederation which has already pledged its support to blatter
if al hussein is unable to secure the support of his own confederation it would mean his challenge would be over before it had even begun

there's a heavy neo nazi population in the area freeman told cnn over the phone last week
i'm black so traveling to that part of germany was well very intimidating he said with a chuckle
a generation ago when it was part of the former east germany hoyerswerda was held up as an example of a communist utopia
but when the berlin wall fell in one thousand nine hundred and eighty nine and germany reunited a year later economic reform began choking the city of seventy two thousand
first jobs began disappearing then so did the residents
many left town looking for better opportunities
in one thousand nine hundred and ninety one gangs attacked the homes of hundreds of immigrant workers there including vietnamese and africans the new york times reported
authorities were forced to evacuate the terrified laborers to a military base
by the time freeman arrived last year its population had withered to just thirty five thousand
he wanted to document the residents painful economic struggle to survive
initially he thought he'd tell the story through the eyes of one displaced family
but when i got there i found the issue was much bigger freeman said
everyone was going through it
so freeman widened his editorial lens and painted a photographic landscape of a larger issue
it wasn't simply residents survival at stake
the very existence of the town itself was clearly in jeopardy
several residents were moved out of their homes to make room for a coal mining operation
one of freeman's favorite photos shows an odd cardboard cutout in a window showing happy residents smiling inside their doomed homes
it promoted this perfect couple and a perfect world when it really wasn't perfect freeman said
the town felt eerie he said like i was in some sort of horror film
almost always freeman and his german guide traveled around the city on bicycles
at one point they found themselves accosted by a group of men at a campsite
they stepped in front of us and did the whole heil hitler putting their hands up and talking in german freeman recalled
his guide stepped in and began speaking with the men
there was an argument and they told us to get out of their way freeman said
there was a lot of yelling
finally they moved and continued yelling things as we biked away
thinking back it's like how did i do that 
he laughed
freeman first fell in love with photography during his high school days in atlanta after his best friend's father loaned him a small point and shoot camera
once he started playing with it he couldn't put it down
freeman's fascination with creating images led to a question which later became a goal
how can i make a living as a photographer 
a college degree and internships at the new york times led to his current position as a photographer for new york mayor bill de blasio
it's really cool
i feel like the job presents different challenges that don't exist in newspaper and other forms freeman said
you have to find a way to make photographing someone at a podium interesting
one day he hopes to have a freelance photo video company where he can focus on his true passion
portraits
that's really what i love to do just capturing someone's character in one frame freeman said
i find it very character revealing
it's very subtle

because of the reality star and her naked backside we heard the phrase break the internet more than we would have imagined in two thousand and fourteen
of course no one thing actually broke it but here are ten of the memes and hashtags that tried
of course we have to start with this one but what is really left to say 
she did her booty duty by posing nude and oiled on the cover
what followed was an embarrassment of meme riches with the peach emoji booty being one of the most innocent
it was the fight watched round the world
video of superstar rapper jay z being pummeled by his sister in law singer and fashionista solange knowles in an elevator gave birth to sooooo many memes
some were funny some were rude but all were creative
three
it's none of kermit's business
kermit loves his tea
this meme was all about the world's most famous muppet offering snarky social commentary while sipping his beverage and ending with the line but that's none of my business
this social media campaign got started in response to postings by elliot rodger who went on killing spree in isla vista california in may
his anger toward women sparked the hashtag women used to share their stories and thoughts on violence and misogyny
the als ice bucket challenge very quickly raised more than one hundred million dollar and awareness about amyotrophic lateral sclerosis often referred to as lou gehrig's disease
hundreds of celebs and thousands of nonfamous folks posted videos of themselves being doused for the cause
according to google there were more than ninety million searches for the term in august
icebucketchallenge was everywhere from twitter to instagram and facebook
alex lee was just your typical sixteen year old working a part time job at target when a picture of him went viral after it was tweeted thanks to his handsome visage
quicker than you could say internet sensation the kid was everywhere
based on a new york times profile he seems to have taken it all in stride
the hashtag has exploded since the acquittal of george zimmerman in the death of trayvon martin and the more recent deaths of michael brown and eric garner after encounters with police officers
it's helped lead the online discussion of race relations in america
howard performed magnificently during the usa belgium world cup match and his goalie skills inspired memes listing other things he could save
the u.s. team may not have won the world cup but howard definitely won the internet
months before the now famous sony hack celebrities such as actress jennifer lawrence and model kate upton had to deal with their icloud accounts being compromised and personal photos disseminated
the fbi quickly got on the case but not before the world had seen way more of some stars than they ever anticipated
many of the memes aren't suitable for work but they are out there for you to peruse after you clock out
after a mechanical space traveler called the philae probe landed on a comet in november the internet started theorizing about other things that are surely easier to accomplish than a comet landing but aren't happening
the jokes were endless but seriously why can't you order breakfast at mcdonald's after ten thirty a.m. 
so many of the suggestions made total sense and we co signed many of them except wecanlandonacometbutwecant uncat the internet
because honestly the internet was made for cat memes

cnn marketplace africa covers the macro trends impacting the region and also focuses on the continent's key industries and corporations
according to new research from the legatum institute which last week ranked prosperity in thirty eight african countries around criteria ranging from economics to education to health the title belongs to botswana the diamond rich country in southern africa
as well as posting a relatively high per capita gross domestic product of fifteen thousand one hundred and seventy six dollar botswana also fared well in terms of governance education and personal freedom
as the country spends eight percents of its gdp on education it is among the biggest proportional spenders in the world according to the world bank
this is the third year in a row that botswana has topped the index
in contrast the central african republic was the lowest ranked country on the continent
the country which has a per capita gdp of five hundred and eighty four dollar has seen increasing violence since the end of two thousand and twelve and only twenty one point five percents of the population have access to sanitation according to the prosperity index
rwanda was the best improver gaining five ranking places to end up as the eighth most prosperous country in africa
the country was found to have the sixth highest ranking in regulation and government effectiveness the eighth highest score in rule of law and the lowest perceptions of corruption in africa
rwanda deserves credit for actively encouraging women to play a central role in shaping the future of their country
and it seems to be paying dividends says the report
these findings bucked trends across the continent where forty one percents of women are out of work as opposed to twenty three percents of men
we can not talk about the prosperity of women in africa if we don't change the inappropriate policies that hinder their progress argues marieme jamme a davos young global leader and ceo of spotone global solutions
we can not sugar coat the issues of funding mentoring gender equality recognition and representation and expect women to come winners within the current framework and plans we have in africa
other notable gainers since two thousand and twelve included countries from east africa while neither kenya nor mozambique featured in the top ten most prosperous countries in africa they both rose by four places in the rankings since two thousand and twelve
as over forty four percents of kenyans thought it was a good time to find employment the country ranked ninth in terms of entrepreneurship and opportunity
but following the two thousand and thirteen siege in nairobi's westgate mall the country ranked thirty two of thirty eight in terms of safety and security
regional partner tanzania by contrast fell eight places since two thousand and twelve going from eleven th to nineteen th in the latest rankings
a drop in five year average growth and an increase in inflation were coupled with a decline in confidence in financial institutions and falling satisfaction with living standards
the country fared particularly badly in terms of personal freedom where it fell from twenty four th to twenty eight th
while tanzania's education score rose by one place in the rankings the report argues that tanzania needs to improve the quality of education in schools rather than focusing on enrollment rates
tanzanian education is not producing graduates with the skills needed to work in the formal sector the report says
the lack of an adequately skilled workforce is a hindrance to investment in sectors such as manufacturing construction mining agriculture finance and communications.tanzania needs education that improves students chances of finding employment
the biggest faller was malawi which dropped eleven places since two thousand and twelve to twenty th in the index
the report cites a drop in the five year gdp growth rate as part of the reason the country fell by eighteen places in the economy sub index
in all average prosperity in africa has been on the up since two thousand and twelve
in the past two years all countries have seen increases in at least one area tracked by the report
but nathan gamester program director of the prosperity index added a cautious note to the findings
as african economies grow a chief concern for many governments is how to ensure that the fruits of growth benefit a majority of the population and contribute to true long term prosperity
click through the gallery above to find out what are africa's top ten prosperous countries according to the legatum institute

in case you haven't noticed president obama has been flexing his executive muscles lately
on paper it's a head scratcher
after all he lost control of the senate in the last election
his popularity is hovering near an all time low
and of course he's a lame duck
only no one seems to have told him
it's as if he has shed his clark kent ish demeanor for the more flamboyant cape
he's no superman to be sure but he's spending an awful lot of time lately trying to get off the ground
so after suffering a political shellacking he's showing he still has some muscle using executive authority everywhere he believes he can
president bill clinton famously declared his relevance months after losing control of the house in one thousand nine hundred and ninety four
obama on the other hand is literally leaping into unilateral action
on immigration
on climate change
on regulating the internet
on cuba
i'm energized said a buoyant president in his year end press conference friday
i'm excited about the prospects for the next couple of years
and i'm certainly not going to be stopping for a minute
translation
this is the new all drama obama
and all of that pent up energy ambition and action barely two months after losing control of the senate
anyone would become annoyed and frustrated if you were accused of being a wuss says a senior democratic policy adviser
and it's always better to be on offense than defense
it wasn't exactly a state secret that obama had a lot on his to do list after the election
the thinking according to a knowledgeable source
he felt constrained and frustrated by his tactical responsibilities to democrats in trouble
don't rock the boat
don't make democrats take hard votes
don't even campaign in red states
so he didn't
and as it turns out the restraint helped not one whit
so now with the clock ticking he's moved from party cheerleader to the head of the executive branch
it's katie bar the door with or without the congress
at the press conference today the president strongly hinted at a veto of the keystone xl pipelineso take that republicans and red state democrats
and he wants tax reform too
t is the season for a presidential list and he's checking it twice as his legacy looms
everything he is doing redefines the very notion of a lame duck
but here's what this flurry of activity also defines
the two thousand and sixteen presidential race
in forcing the cuba issue front and center for instance republican presidential wannabes have to respond
so too on obama's moves on immigration
all sorts of new tests of conservative loyalty are being created by these moves
and some candidates could find themselves pushed in a direction they might not otherwise go
for instance parse the differences between republican pre presidential candidates marco rubio jeb bush and rand paul on obama's cuba deal
rubio called the president the single worst negotiator we have had in the white house in my lifetime
bush did not like the deal but stopped short of name calling
i don't think we should be negotiating with a repressive regime bush said a long way from rubio's accusation that the president was willfully ignorant and nave
and rand paul went even further in obama's direction saying opening up cuba is probably a good idea
in appealing to the younger cuban american demographic obama is making the republicans choose sides
and he's gambling that the numbers are with him
eventually democrats will have to do the same
if obama's audacity turns out to be misdirected hillary clinton will have to explain and likely defend it
if he's not pro active enough the elizabeth warren wing of the party will react
it's a clich that presidential campaigns are generally defined by the president who served before
barack obama is actively making sure that's the case
but there's one caveat in this new muscular pro active obama world
it just might lead to higher expectations
which is exactly where obama began and then faded

editor's note
hamdi ulukaya is ceo of chobani which makes a popular brand of greek style yogurt
the views expressed are his own
like many entrepreneurs i am often asked about the secrets to building a successful career
the advice i give is that whether you're in silicon valley creating apps or in unadilla valley in upstate new york making yogurt there are many common ingredients for success
but everything starts with opportunity whether it be the opportunity to study to work to build something or the opportunities afforded by a safe home a stable society and a secure environment
these were all opportunities that i enjoyed as a young boy in a kurdish community in eastern turkey and as a young man who came to america inspired by the american dream
sadly far too many in the region where i grew up will never receive the opportunities that i had
in the decade since i began the chobani business dramatic changes have occurred in the middle east
conflict has engulfed iraq and syria forcing millions of people to flee from their homes and seek refuge in neighboring countries
when i watch the reports from towns like kobani i see a haunting despair in the eyes of refugees
their faces look familiar they are just like my aunts uncles and childhood friends
and yet the fear in their eyes seems very different
the truth is that although i grew up in their part of the world i can't imagine what it must be like to be forced to flee your home with your family not knowing if your grandmother will survive the journey or your daughter will ever see home again
in the past the world has risen to the moment and responded to similar crises
refugees from wartime europe were taken in by dozens of countries across the world in the one thousand nine hundred and forty s and one thousand nine hundred and fifty s. similarly victims of conflict in vietnam cambodia and east africa in the one thousand nine hundred and seventy s and those from the balkans in the one thousand nine hundred and ninety s found welcoming new homes in faraway countries
with all that in mind i can not understand why the welcoming arms of the international community have become so feeble and spiritless in the face of the latest crisis
last week at a pledging conference in geneva switzerland other countries could only muster a commitment to take in thirty eight thousand more refugees from syria in two thousand and fifteen despite the fact that we are currently facing the largest refugee crisis since world war ii
more than fifty million people around the world are now refugees or displaced people robbed of life's opportunities by war persecution and natural disasters
so where is the big hearted response of previous generations 
have our hearts turned to stone 
turkey alone took in more people in three days than the international community has offered to welcome in an entire year
lebanon and jordan have likewise absorbed enormous numbers
these countries and agencies like the united nations high commissioner for refugees and the international rescue committee which do extraordinary work desperately need financial support to be able to provide the basic essentials for those who have fled across borders in search of safety
how can it be that such suffering exists just a few hours plane ride from some of the world's richest capitals 
and how can so many enjoy a life of abundance and yet despite our more interconnected world appear so oblivious to quite how bad things have gotten 
generosity starts with us as individuals
but the needs in this desperate situation are far too immense for private donors to ever meet on their own
governments across the globe must therefore answer the call to action just as they've done in the past
it is with this pressing need for action in mind that i have been a strong supporter of the u.n.'s immediate efforts to get winter supplies to refugee camps
i am also supporting new campaign initiatives to help advance long term solutions to the crisis
such efforts it is hoped will help decision makers around the world hear the voices of those that need help the most
this week i am writing to the foreign ministers of ten key countries calling on them to show leadership and deliver on their past commitments
it is a campaign i will continue with for as long as this crisis persists
and i would urge entrepreneurs from across the globe men and women who have already demonstrated their ability to shake things up to join in and press for change to address this injustice
so as many of us prepare to spend the holiday season with families and in conditions that millions of refugees could only dream of it is time to raise our voices as we seek to jolt our leaders into action
this is what it means to have a human heart
not to avert our gaze from others suffering but to step forward
to open our arms
to lift our voices and call for our leaders to wake up
and to do our duty to these sons and daughters brothers and sisters who are all part of the one human family
as those blessed with opportunity in our own lives we must restore opportunity and hope to theirs

if golf has a reputation for being a bit stuffy then the bryan brothers and their trick shots are a much needed blast of fresh air
hailing from south carolina george and younger brother wesley have been attracting a growing band of followers with a colorful array of videos
from casually shooting hoops with a wedge to smashing shots from mid air in the dark the siblings are hoping to show off golf in a new light and attract a younger generation of players back to the sport
we love golf but most people think it's kind of boring george bryan told cnn
we're providing something that's a little different
we're bringing a kind of hip fun way to view golf and hope that it brings in a younger demographic
we want them to say
that's fun i wan na go try the game the twenty six year old added
both brothers are qualified professionals and started filming trick shots as a hobby earlier this year but it has quickly grown into a mini industry after racking up tens of thousands of clicks on their website and youtube
most of the tricks are done on the fly explains twenty four year old wesley who smashes the balls set up by george
a lot of them work on the first or second try
if the ball comes into my hit zone then it normally goes pretty quick a lot quicker than what people say on the comments board he added
the pair started out experimenting at woodcreek and wildewood their local club in state capital columbia but have since diversified their content
in the summer a football themed world cup edition celebrated this year's tournament in brazil and collaborations with basketball trick shot specialists the legendary shots and pro golfer and model blair o'neal have widened their appeal
the brothers are not the only trick shot artists to showcase their skills online
french golf professional romain bechu's incredible ball juggling skills has received over half a million views on youtube and british trick shot specialist david edwards has performed his routine at dozens of pro events including the open championship and the ryder cup
when the bryan brothers are not dreaming up new routines they compete on the national golf association pro golf tour and the web dot com tour a developmental tour for the main pga tour which is where the pair hope to end up playing one day
the goal is really to use this to help our pro golf careers out but at the same time we view this as a hobby we both enjoy it george says
and when we do have an off week it's good to get out minds off tournament golf and there's no better outlet to be creative than trying some trick shots out and seeing how far we can take it

it was the computer classroom where i cracked
i'd managed to remain detached until then
i wanted to tell the story
look but don't internalize was the mantra i was repeating inside my head
tell the facts explain what you are seeing and what happened
i focused
i don't think i've been somewhere with so much blood on the floor
over the years covering wars i've seen more than my share
sarajevo the war in bosnia as yugoslavia tore itself apart was an inoculation against my visceral fear of the red stuff
in that conflict mortars ripped through crowds of civilians
i soon learned how head wounds bleed
it's different
you don't forget
here it was again in the auditorium
dark and heavy
don't think focus and do your job i was reminding myself
but after a while i couldn't
these were children innocents
parents not far from here are suffering a harrowing pain none of us can imagine
parents whose job in the army is to protect their country not able to save their own children
the army officer showed us the doors where the children had tried to break out of the auditorium to run away from the taliban gunmen
the carpet is sticky and red
the floor tiles a mess of the worst of sarajevo
the taliban could not have been more callous and calculating
where the children were most concentrated they turned their automatic weapons on them at point blank range
cold blooded murder
the officer tells me close to one hundred children were gunned down right here
again i'm telling myself to focus
explain this brutal cowardly act
leaving the dark sad auditorium for the light of day i feel i can breathe better
i look up at the sky
it's the color of hope clear blue and not a cloud to be seen
i shouldn't have looked down again
i'm walking over to the classrooms at army public school and degree college
drops smudges pools of blood are everywhere
i'm becoming conscious that i'm trying not to step on them
it seems disrespectful somehow
how i am thinking could the taliban be looking for even more bloodletting when they have already killed so many 
but they are
that's when i get to the computer classroom maybe thirty feet long by fifteen feet across
computers on rough benches down each side of the room
space for maybe a dozen or so children to hone their computer skills
you didn't have to be rich to send your child to this school and in pakistan in peshawar in particular on a global scale that implies your means might be quite humble indeed
quite possibly some of these kids wouldn't have a computer at home
in our ever interconnected world lessons in this room could have been some of the most valuable to their futures
and that's it
i'm standing there realizing they have no futures now
the base horror that took place here is startlingly and immediately evident
chairs still at computers thick blood pooled underneath on the tile floor
the gunmen came in and before the children could escape opened fire
as i try to explain all this on camera i can feel my voice cracking
it's not a conscious thing its what the brain does a self defense maybe
such a horrible waste of so many bright futures so many parents in pain
it hurts and there is no getting away from it

the mother of seven of the eight children found dead in a house in the northeastern australian city of cairns has been arrested on suspicion of murder police detective inspector bruno asnicar said saturday morning
the thirty seven year old woman is under police guard at a hospital and in stable condition he said at a news conference
the discovery of the bodies added to a traumatic week for australia after a deadly hostage taking in sydney
police said they were called to the suburban house in the manoora area of cairns on friday morning after reports of an injured woman
inside officers found the bodies of eight children between the ages of eighteen months and fourteen years police said
the eighth child killed was a niece of the woman asnicar said
they're only babies lisa thaiday a relative of the family told cnn affiliate seven network
she said the horrendous scene had been discovered by a twenty year old brother of the children
he got off the bus and he found his mother and siblings she said
police said saturday they talked to the twenty year old but that he is not a suspect
seven network reported that the children were part of the local community of torres strait islanders an indigenous people from the region
australian media reported that at least some of the victims were believed to have been stabbed
but asnicar declined to confirm that saying police are waiting for autopsy reports
trying days for our country 
images from the scene showed distraught neighbors gathered near the area cordoned off around the one story house where christmas decorations were still hanging in the front window
it is so difficult to come to terms with what has happened on a street i have visited so many times among residents i have so often spoken with said gavin king the local member of parliament
cairns is a remote coastal city of roughly one hundred and fifty thousand residents that's popular with tourists as a jumping off point for visiting the great barrier reef
the news out of cairns is heartbreaking prime minister tony abbott said in a statement
all parents would feel a gut wrenching sadness at what has happened
this is an unspeakable crime
australia had already been shaken this week by a dramatic siege at a cafe in the heart of sydney in which two of the hostages were killed along with the gunman who held them captive
these are trying days for our country abbott said
tonight there will be tears and prayers across our country for these children
they never annoyed us 
the road where the house is situated has been blocked off and the crime scene locked down while forensic experts carry out their work police said
specialist police officers will also be arriving from brisbane another city in queensland asnicar said
this is not a small job
we're not taking this lightly at all he told reporters
we will cover every angle before this is finished
a neighbor of the house where the bodies were found said the family who lived there had always been very quiet
she told cnn affiliate seven network that she'd heard no noise from the house friday as she sat in her front room until the sudden burst of police sirens
another neighbor patricia birch said she heard some arguments on the property around ten a.m. but she agreed the family wasn't known for causing problems
they never annoyed us she told the cairns post
they were really good



cnn ones to watch shines a spotlight on the up and coming creative talents set to be the next big names in culture and the arts

dozens of militants were killed in crackdowns across pakistan on friday officials said days after the pakistani taliban massacred nearly one hundred and fifty people at a school
the pakistani military claimed it killed thirty two militants in an ambush as they were moving toward the afghan border in the northwestern province of khyber pakhtunkhwa
the military's statement didn't specify whether any of those killed were taliban members or say whether the ambush was linked to tuesday's deadly attack by the group on a school in peshawar the capital of khyber pakhtunkhwa
the military claimed that the fleeing insurgents left behind bodies of their accomplices after the firefight
three members of the pakistani security forces were wounded it said
cnn wasn't able to independently confirm what took place
pakistani security forces also killed eight militants in the southwestern province of balochistan including a taliban commander during a heavy exchange of fire an intelligence officer said
the military actions follow this week's horrifying taliban attack on an army school in peshawar that killed one hundred and forty five people one hundred and thirty two of them children
the school massacre prompted widespread revulsion across pakistan
prime minister nawaz sharif responded by announcing an end to a moratorium on the death penalty in terrorism cases
the pakistani taliban known as the tehreek e taliban pakistan said they targeted a school that mostly admits soldiers children because the students aspired to follow in their fathers footsteps and target militants
they also said it was revenge for the killing of hundreds of innocent tribesmen and their children during a recent offensive by pakistan's military
the pakistani army has been conducting a ground offensive aimed at clearing out taliban and other militants in the loosely governed tribal areas of northwestern pakistan
the campaign has displaced tens of thousands of people
the pakistani taliban which has close ties with its namesake in afghanistan has long taken credit for an extensive list of assaults on civilians and security forces in pakistan

nope it's just another series of air dramas involving disruptive chinese air travelers
it hasn't been the most peaceful fortnight in the aviation industry we've seen the aftermath of a korean air exec's nut rage and randb singer jeremih arrested for attempting to force open a closed airplane door after missing the last call for boarding
in the midst of this unruly behavior have come no fewer than four inflight dramas involving chinese tourists
on the heels of a gim me my cup noodle water
meltdown and two emergency exit incidents a bizarre fight between multiple passengers broke out over a dispute involving a crying baby
the poor kid probably just couldn't get any sleep with all the fuss going on
the fortnight of infamy was highlighted by the cup noodle row heard round the world or at least across asia
on december eleven four tourists threw a series of tantrums on an air asia flight from bangkok to nanjing
the episode began during takeoff when observing safety rules cabin staff refused to serve hot water to a couple who wanted to immediately get going on their cup noodle
the couple retaliated by crushing nuts on the floor
the man wang was allegedly still fuming when a flight attendant for the budget airline brought him a cup of hot water after the plane reached cruising altitude then attempted to charge him sixty thai baht for the water
you think i can't afford it 
wang demanded using the word laozi a pompous way of referring to one's self as a boss or superior
as the quarrel dragged on the man's girlfriend zhang threw hot water on the back of the flight attendant
thai authorities eventually ordered zhang to pay fifty thousand baht to the flight attendant
each passenger involved in the incident was fined amounts between three dollar and six dollar
the china national tourism administration issued a stern statement after the air asia episode saying it had severely damaged the overall image of chinese people and demanding local authorities review the case
in recent years state media has reported numerous dramatic incidents involving irate passengers ranging from blocking moving aircraft on an active runway to fistfights with airport employees
during an official visit to the maldives in september president xi jinping personally asked chinese tourists to behave themselves while traveling abroad
last year the government released a lengthy list of do's and don'ts aimed at turning chinese travelers into civilized tourists
all the warnings and cajoling seem to have fallen on deaf ears though

flight diverted after passenger reportedly throws hot water at crew member
impatient or lacking fresh air or
something
chinese passengers in separate incidents in the past two weeks decided to deal with their stuck on a plane dilemmas in unexpected fashion
upon landing in sanya on december eight after a china eastern flight from xi'an a fidgety passenger not content to suffer through the excruciating disembarkation process don't judge
we've all been there
went ahead and opened the emergency exit door engaging the aircraft's inflatable slide
xinhua news agency said the reason for the man's action was unknown but the nanfang website from southern china reported that the passenger said he simply wanted to depart the plane sooner
his solution to borrow loosely from jane austen did display a certain amount of sense if not sensibility
regardless the shortcut cost the airline sixteen thousand dollar and a two hour delay according to xinhua
that unauthorized exit was followed by an incident on december fourteen during which a first time flier on a xiamen air flight reportedly felt the urge for some fresh air while waiting for his plane to take off
his fix 
open the emergency door for better ventilation
the man wasn't fined or punished because the act didn't cause any damage stated the airline
calm in the skies reigned for three entire days before being shattered on thursday when a minor brawl broke out on an air china flight from chongqing to hong kong
the imbroglio began when a pair of passengers complained about the crying baby seated behind them
the child's mother meanwhile spared no words in expressing her own displeasure with the people in front reclining their seats into her space
unable to compromise the quarrel escalated into a full on fight
a photo in which one woman appears ready to slap another woman who herself seems to be floating almost perpendicular to the floor of the aircraft perhaps readying to deliver an unorthodox blow of her own quickly circulated online
a group brawl above seven thousand five hundred meters
our plane was almost turned around wrote a passenger who shared the incident and picture on weibo china's twitter
the plane wasn't diverted though hong kong police were called in to keep everyone calm and carrying on once the plane landed
meanwhile no air rage incidents have been reported for twenty four hours
and counting

a billionaire who jointly controls asia's biggest property development company and a former no
two official of hong kong were found guilty of conspiracy to commit misconduct in the city's biggest corruption trial
the tycoon thomas kwok along with his younger brother raymond kwok were accused of bribing rafael hui the government official in offenses spanning nearly a decade
the kwok brothers who rank eighty six th on the two thousand and fourteen forbes list of the world's richest people are co chairs of the developer giant sun hung kai which is responsible for many of hong kong's most iconic skyscrapers
the main question during their trial was whether the brothers had bought the allegiance of hui hong kong's former chief secretary
after five days of deliberation a hong kong high court jury found the older kwok guilty of bribing hui between two thousand and five and two thousand and seven
immediately after the verdict thomas kwok resigned from his position at sun hung kai and his son adam kwok was named the company's next executive director
meanwhile his younger brother raymond kwok was cleared of all charges
hui is the highest ranking former official to face trial in hong kong
the court looked into whether hui received monetary and housing benefits worth at least four point three million dollar from the kwoks in return for government decisions favorable to the company
the charges related to accepting rent free apartments unsecured loans and a consultancy agreement with the property company
the jury found him guilty on three counts of misconduct in a public office conspiracy to commit misconduct in public office and conspiracy to offer an advantage to a public servant
the jury also found thomas chan who was responsible for land acquisition at the company and francis kwan a former hong kong stock exchange official guilty for making a series of payments to hui
the sentencing hearing for the four who were convicted will be held monday
raymond kwok was released from custody after his arrest in two thousand and twelve
as he left the court kwok said he had mixed feelings that he was free but his brother had been found guilty
the case caused a media frenzy in the city where real estate is a local obsession
sun hung kai which helped to build some of the tallest buildings in the city's celebrated skyline contributed to the kwok brothers estimated eighteen point three billion dollar fortune

the islamist extremist militants like to depict their stronghold city of raqqa to the world as a caliphate paradise where life under strictest sharia is practically heaven on earth
but rss activists in the city reveal on social media raqqa's bleeding underbelly the terrorizing of residents
warnings of graphic content speckle its twitter feed where photos of public beheadings and stonings of residents in syrian cities are posted in unflinching detail
rss also reports coalition airstrike hits against isis and warns raqqa residents about new strict sharia rules the militants impose on them
but activists participating in rss activities have another enemy
before isis took over their town they were taking the same actions against the syrian regime
the raqqa target who passed along the malware to the citizen lab did not fall for its ploy and the group was not successfully hacked as far as the citizen lab researcher john scott railton knows
but he fears others who may have received the target email may not have been so savvy or lucky
the malware used in the attack is simple and lean and whoever wrote it did some things wrong or felt it wasn't necessary to do them right
the citizen lab found the malware to be effective and very dangerous even without proper coding whistles and bells because its targeting of victims is socially savvy
this is how it works
the victim receives an enticing email tailored to his anti isis interests from people claiming to be expat syrian activists living in canada
they ask for the local activist's help in working with mainstream media
we are preparing a lengthy news report on the realities of life in raqqah the email reads
we are sharing some information with you with the hope that you will correct it in case it contains errors
images are attached showing areal photos with spots marked on them portraying alleged isis strongholds and u.s. airstrike targets
and the email includes a link to a file sharing site where the victim is encouraged to download files which contain a slideshow of more such images
but in the download is also a malicious file and while the victim views more photos it installs a set of small malware files onto the target's computer
once there these bad files don't do much the citizen lab said
just enough
the custom malware
beacons home with the ip address of the victim's computer and details about his or her system each time the computer restarts it said in its study
that's enough for militants who know the area to determine the user's physical location
the files don't include a key logger although many forms of the software that monitors what infected users are writing are readily available on the internet
such rats are typical of the syrian regime whose hackers seems more interested in obtaining opposition activist content the researchers scott railton and seth hardy said
a rat would have provided much greater access alongside ip information they said
it makes the researchers think that whoever is using the slideshow malware may be interested only in identifying and locating a target
find his internet caf or apartment
haul him in
punish him or execute him
that's probably the idea the citizen lab said
american journalist james foley who isis later beheaded was captured coming out of an internet caf in syria in two thousand and twelve before isis officially existed
this attempted hack doesn't bear the signature of typical syrian regime attackers the citizen lab said
they usually employ servers to facilitate data sent back by their rats but this malware doesn't need one
it sends an attachment with the sparse information it gathers to an email account
this functionality would be especially useful to an adversary unsure of whether it can maintain uninterrupted internet connectivity the researchers said
whether shoddiness or simplicity
that email is improperly encrypted leaving the recipient's logon credentials open to interception
one of the malware's passwords is also visible in its code
there are other apparent bugs and software itself is unusually artless
it relies on a half dozen separate executable files each with a single task the researchers said
but keeping it bare bones has an advantage the researchers said
the program looks less like malware and may attract less attention from endpoint protection tools and scanners
detections were low when the file was first submitted to virustotal for example
it registered only six fifty five detections by anti virus scanners or a ten percents detection rate
this malware flies under the radar

there's little question that edm is the fastest growing musical genre out there
with djs like calvin harris david guetta and tisto leading the pack electronic music's popularity has ballooned in the past decade
from festivals to radio airplay social media and even collaborating with a list musicians edm artists are getting a lot of attention and money from all over the place
the numbers don't lie
so far forbes top ten edm artists have racked up a combined two hundred and sixty eight million dollar this year an eleven percents increase from two thousand and thirteen with top earner harris bringing in sixty six million dollar
how did this musical genre grow from a small cult following into this global phenomenon we feel today 
how have those who've stuck with it from the beginning grown with it 
and where is it going next 
to obtain these answers we headed to one of the biggest festivals in the world tomorrowworld to meet up with some of the genre's key players
david guetta tisto steve aoki and edm's newest dynamic duo dimitri vegas and like mike
electronic dance music is not a new genre
in fact it's been around for more than three decades
david guetta whose dj days began in paris in the late eighties recalls how the house electronic music movement began when the disco era was ending
there was a movement called disco sucks he says
it was a shame to like disco but then there was no music to dance to so some djs started to use old disco records but the b sides and the acapellas and we began producing beats with drum machines
i remember buying those records and the label says guetta
would use old records and print on top of it melt it and print on the top.very low quality this was super super underground
in other words disco music is edm's ancestor
i started in eighty eight to play house music it was a huge revolution for me
i went to london and i saw a dj on stage and that was crazy at the time
i was one of the really respected and famous djs in paris but they would never show me
i was hidden
a dj on stage and people dancing and facing the dj looking at him 
i was like wow 
says guetta as if still surprised to this day
a few years later in the early nineties in the netherlands tijs michiel verwest began his journey to becoming tisto
he also started when the genre was completely underground
a trip to spain some parties and general love for music got him interested in becoming a dj
back then first of all we all played vinyl records so even when you knew the track you could not get it
everything was very exclusive says tisto in his dressing room three hundred meters away from the main stage of tomorrowworld
that's the big difference with nowadays because when you jam to a track you already know what it is and then right away you have the song in your phone or your laptop.that was a very magical period because you played a track and people said i know this track but they still couldn't find it
that was very special says tijs as his staff calls him
it's hard to pinpoint a date and location to the beginnings of edm
some say it began in germany and london others make a case that it started in detroit in the u.s. for guetta both continents played a role this is what happened.it was born in the u.s. but the u.k. made it trendy
and it became a massive movement in europe but never in the u.s. which is crazy
he later adds i think america is always creating the new movement and then the u.k. has this genius of taking this concept and making it accessible to the masses
from underground to the masses
recently guetta has had mainstream success by collaborating with pop stars like kelly rowland and the black eyed peas for whom he produced the best selling single i got ta feeling in two thousand and nine
other successful djs including likes of calvin harris and avicii have also found success this way
i love collaborating outside of my space says steve aoki who has worked with artists like will.i.am and luke steele
when i got into the dance culture and started producing the music i kept on thinking how to do something unique or different than what the status quo does
for edm collaborations may have attracted listeners but the internet and its subsequent components i.e
social media apps and music sharing programs have played essential roles in getting more
nowadays in the digital era success is measured in followers video hits downloads hashtags tweets retweets and likes

fifteen super hot djs who deserve to be stars
for us it has played a very big role says michael thivaios of the duo dimitri vegas and like mike
we can make a new track and with one click it'll be spread all over the world
twenty years ago you had a vinyl and that vinyl had to go to a distributor and six months later maybe another country would have the vinyl adds the other half of the duo dimitri thivaios
all we did for one year is talk to djs by facebook and somehow that got us our first gig
social media has been the biggest factor in our career
in europe and the americas mainly there are an increasing number of electronic music festivals
events that gather people from all over the world and celebrate in unison
the tomorrowworld festival celebrated outside of atlanta georgia gathered one hundred and sixty thousand people from seventy five countries this year according to the organizers
it's like a theme park for adults says thivaios
not all genres can brag about selling out festivals with over one hundred and fifty thousand attendees and do it in a matter of minutes
sure some could mention the bonnaroos and the coachellas of the world but they offer musical variety
from pop to rock rap to indie and even country
edm festivals offer only edm
when i'm on stage i'm looking out and seeing everyone putting up their flags from hundreds of different countries representing hundreds of different cultural lifestyles
they're all jumping in unison forming almost like one entity one spiritual being adds aoki who besides his music is known for his selfies with the crowds riding inflatable rafts and caking one lucky fan per show
if you're confused about the latter it's a steve aoki trademark where he throws a whole cake to someone in the audience
based on reactions seen from the fans they love it
when they get caked in the face the first thing they do is immediately turn around to make sure that everyone else saw that they got caked it's a very bizarre thing
people don't get it says aoki full of enthusiasm
naturally edm was unlikely to become this popular without generating incredible amounts of money
a recent report stated that edm is a six point two billion dollar global industry
most of the money comes from festivals las vegas club dates and other global club gigs
all this peaked the interest of ad men and the big brands they represent
in fact some have already made moves and are sponsoring festivals events and others have djs featured in commercials
business is good but is the music getting better 
edm has been highly criticized
many see edm as an art that lost its purity
it's an evolution
the thing is that every musical genre starts from the underground gets trendy then it becomes popular and then it dies or it is reinvented in a different way says guetta
many wonder if edm is at his highest point
is this its climax 
or will it end soon just like disco did 
they've been asking me that since one thousand nine hundred and ninety four is it going to end 
i always say i don't know
it keeps evolving every year something new comes up and now it's at the highest it ever has been so now i don't know how much higher and how much better it'll get says tisto
it has been more than twenty twenty five years that this music is existing so it's already amazing

three bodies in total were found amid the squalor at twenty three st. paul street in blackstone a town on the rhode island border and on tuesday their mother was charged with murder in the deaths of two of them
erika murray thirty one was indicted on nine charges in all according to worcester county district attorney joseph early
those charges included neglect abuse reckless endangerment concealing a fetal death and even animal cruelty in addition to the murder charges
she's being held on one million dollar bail
her boyfriend who also lived at twenty three st. paul was also indicted tuesday but not on charges of murder
ray rivera thirty eight was indicted on two counts of assault and battery on a child causing substantial bodily injury two counts of reckless endangerment of a child two counts of cruelty to animals and one count of cultivating marijuana
he is being held on one hundred thousand dollar bail
he's making absolutely no statement at this time other than to absolutely deny these allegations rivera's attorney nicole longton said according to cnn affiliate whdh
father says he was unaware of the children
both rivera and murray maintain that he not only never knew about the three infants he fathered that died in his home he also was somehow unaware of two of the four living ones that the state removed from his one thousand one hundred and fifty square foot home
dna tests determined that rivera was the father of all seven according to whdh
it is a mystery to me how mr. rivera could have failed to notice numerous pregnancies the woman with whom he shared a bed murray's attorney told cnn in september
it's a mystery to me how he could have failed to realize that there were two children living under the same roof as him and he didn't know about it
that attorney keith halpern told cnn tuesday that according to murray only one of the three infants was born alive and it lived only a very brief time
put it down for a nap she left it alone for an hour or two and when she came back it wasn't breathing he said
halpern said he had not yet read the grand jury proceedings but it was his understanding that there was no evidence presented indicating erika had done anything to cause the death of any of the children and that the medical examiner testified that there was no determination made regarding the cause or means of death
early said the murder charges stem from the two infants who were found dressed in onesies and diapers but according to halpern that is not an indication that they were ever alive
that is nothing more than an inference that the baby was ever alive
cnn affiliate wcvb reported in october that the skeleton of one of the three infants was found stuffed inside a backpack inside the closet of the bedroom shared by the two children rivera knew about

it was the bomb credited with ending world war ii
days after the united states dropped atomic bombs on the japanese cities of hiroshima and nagasaki in one thousand nine hundred and forty five japan announced its unconditional surrender
in hiroshima eighty thousand people died instantly when the bomb was dropped on august six one thousand nine hundred and forty five and another one hundred and twelve thousand died in the aftermath
more than seventy thousand people died instantly when the second bomb was dropped on august nine in nagasaki
the manhattan project the federal military program where leading scientists developed the atomic bomb in secret could become a national historic park with the help of recently passed congressional legislation
the national defense authorization act includes seven new national park sites the expansion of nine national park sites and the extension of fifteen national heritage areas
the legislation awaits president barack obama's signature
our national parks are a reflection of our nation both past and present and these seven new national park sites will further tell america's stories said clark bunting president and ceo of the national parks conservation association
bipartisan congressional approval for protecting and preserving harriet tubman's heroic life and work columbian mammoths and ice age fossils at tule springs and the complexity of the manhattan project continue to make our national park system our country's best idea he said
here are some potential new and expanded park sites worth exploring
working in secret during world war ii scientists j. robert oppenheimer maria goeppert mayer and others led thousands of workers in los alamos new mexico
oak ridge tennessee
and hanford washington to build a nuclear reactor and assemble the atomic bomb
the legislation authorizes the proposed park which would be located in all three states
its creation is dependent on land acquisition
while the national park service will interpret the sites for the public the u.s. department of energy is responsible for ensuring safety environmental remediation and historic preservation of its manhattan project properties and access to the properties
born into slavery in maryland harriet tubman escaped to philadelphia and rose to become an iconic conductor on the underground railroad returning again and again to maryland to help enslaved people escape to freedom
after the civil war she fought for women's suffrage along with susan b. anthony in auburn new york
the proposed national historical park whose creation is also dependent on land acquisition would include the existing harriet tubman national monument on maryland's eastern shore and add new sites in new york
once home to bison herds prides of lions columbian mammoths saber tooth cats herds of bison and other ice age animals nevada's tule springs desert used to be lush wetlands
the evidence of its past is ripe for further exploration if the area becomes a new national park site as the tule springs fossil beds national monument
the valles caldera national preserve in new mexico is one of the world's best examples of a resurgent caldera and its large eruptions says the national parks conservation association
calderas are vast sunken areas formed after supervolcano eruptions blow out the ground and the land falls back to rest

the site is already owned by the federal government and it would get even more attention as a new national park site
the gettysburg train station where president abraham lincoln arrived on a train to deliver the historic gettysburg address would be added to the existing gettysburg national military park
the train station also served as a field hospital during the battle of gettysburg

it's a long road to recovery for spanish nurse's assistant teresa romero ramos
discharged from hospital six weeks ago after beating ebola she faces life without her beloved dog excalibur put down by spanish authorities for fear he might harbor the deadly virus
and questions remain about how she contracted the virus while helping to care for spanish missionaries brought back from west africa with ebola and the way her own case was handled
romero was in court thursday to seek one hundred and fifty thousand euros in damages from the then madrid health minister she accuses of blaming her for catching the disease
he publicly apologized for the comments and later resigned
she is also taking legal action against regional health authorities over the death of excalibur
speaking to cnn from madrid in her only global tv interview since leaving hospital romero became tearful as she recounted how she learned her adored dog had been put down
due to my serious illness no one was telling me what was happening in the outside world she said
unbeknownst to her locked away in a hospital isolation room animal rights activists had campaigned to prevent the dog's euthanasia with an online petition gathering more than four hundred thousand signatures
but their efforts failed
can pets get or spread ebola 
finally on the day romero received a negative blood test for ebola her husband javier limon broke the news in a phone call to her room
my husband decided to wait in order to tell me about it and to me it was a very sad piece of news totally unexpected
i haven't got words to talk about it she said her emotion obvious
it was probably better not to tell her while she was ill she said but the loss still affects her today
i've forgotten about everything except the death of excalibur not the death itself but the way in which this was done without finding out first whether the dog was infected she said
i think it would've been much wiser to put the dog in quarantine and keep an eye on it rather than to sacrifice the dog like that
this was what happened in the case of texas nurse nina pham whose dog bentley was quarantined while she was treated for ebola
after testing negative for the virus the pet was eventually returned tail wagging to its grateful owner
it was easier for the madrid authorities to have her dog put down romero said but it made what was already a traumatic situation for her far harder
and she still asks herself why it had to be that way
it's a lack of sensitivity a lack of human feelings it's really nasty nasty
everything has been this way but we forget about everything except the death of my dog
the everything romero refers to relates to the way her infection with ebola was first diagnosed and then handled
after she was taken to the alcorcon hospital in madrid by ambulance suffering symptoms including vomiting and a rash she underwent a battery tests
but such was the apparent state of confusion she said that she found out she'd been confirmed as having ebola not from medical staff but by seeing the news story on her cell phone
it is surreal nobody tells you anything and they come and put you inside a bubble and they take you away
and they didn't tell you anything
it is really odd
she said she later found out that the emergency room doctor who first treated her was not informed about her two positive blood tests either
surprising as it is this is how it happened she said
no doctor told me about it nobody told me anything about it nothing
i think that they were going crazy
this took us all aback
cnn is seeking comment from the spanish health ministry over romero's allegation that news that she had tested positive for ebola was given to the press before she found out
it's still not clear how this leak transpired
you think about it 
meanwhile madrid's superior court has already ruled once on the case of excalibur saying that regional health officials did not act recklessly in putting him down
but romero's legal team is planning to take them to court again seeking one hundred and fifty thousand euros compensation for his death
she also wants to see a change in the official protocols for caring for suspected ebola cases so others don't undergo the same ordeal
this could include recording the medical staff as they work so any errors in taking off the protective gear could be spotted and lessons learned according to romero
she says she still does not know how she herself contracted the virus and likely never will
i followed the protocols
i followed the guidelines
i did everything that needs to be done she said
what you are doing is something so serious you are risking your life every time you walk into a room so you think about it
last month the hospital's director general dr. rafael perez santamarina said that through romero's case the hospital had learned many lessons about the treatment of ebola patients and how to protect staff caring for them
romero said she was not yet completely physically recovered from the virus which has killed more than six thousand people in west africa but was slowly getting better
meanwhile her anger and grief over excalibur's fate continues to burn strongly
if i had known about the killing of the dog i would never have volunteered to care for the spanish missionaries she said

violence wracked yemen yet again thursday this time in the form of dual car bomb attacks purportedly carried out by al qaeda militants targeting fighters from the minority albeit powerful houthi group
at least nine houthi fighters died in the attacks on a strategic houthi camp at the airport of western yemen's port city of hodiedah a local interior ministry official and medics told cnn
medics expected the death toll to rise as some of about a dozen people injured in the attacks are in critical condition
the bloodshed speaks to the dangers and instability in the arab nation though this time not involving anyone with the yemeni government
instead it is houthis followers of a sect of shia islam in a country where sunni muslims are the majority who find themselves in the fight
based largely in northern yemen members of the group also known as ansarullah have been increasingly asserting themselves in the country
this included weeks of large anti government protest in the capital sanaa during which houthi fighters attacked state tv headquarters and seized strategic military positions
yemen in midst of an upheaval
scores died in resulting violence and two yemeni prime ministers resigned in two weeks before the powerful rebel group and representatives of major political parties signed a ceasefire in september
but even with that resolved a houthi adversary al qaeda in the arabian peninsula a terror group whose members are sunni muslims remains
that group also known as aqap claimed responsibility for thursday's attack on its twitter account
thursday's violence marked the latest of scores of clashes between houthi and al qaeda fighters
the houthis have managed to defeat al qaeda on numerous fronts including taking the terror group's stronghold of radaa in october
al qaeda has stepped up its attacks on houthi targets since then killing hundreds of houthis and innocent civilians in persistent attacks

u.s. airstrikes have killed two top level and one mid level isis leader a senior u.s. military official tells cnn
haji mutazz was abu bakr al baghdadi's deputy in iraq
abd al basit was his military emir in iraq
and radwan talib was his mosul emir
their deaths resulted from multiple strikes going back to mid november it has taken until now to determine conclusively they were killed
i can confirm that since mid november targeted coalition airstrikes successfully killed multiple senior and mid level leaders within the islamic state of iraq and the levant said pentagon press secretary rear adm. john kirby in a statement on thursday
we believe that the loss of these key leaders degrades isil's ability to command and control current operations against iraqi security forces including kurdish and other local forces in iraq he said
news of the killings was first disclosed by joint chiefs chairman martin dempsey in an interview with the wall street journal
in addition president barack obama signed deployment orders yesterday for one thousand three hundred troops to iraq
this is the lion's share of the one thousand five hundred additional troops he authorized last month
by february the u.s. will have roughly three thousand u.s. troops on the ground
the u.s. troops are also going further afield than they previously were
there are now nearly three hundred u.s. forces at al asad base in anbar province up from just fifty earlier this month
the u.s. military is following through on announced plans to deploy these military advisers and trainers outside of baghdad and erbil

north korea is one of the world's poorest countries seen as well behind most everyone when it comes to most technologies and much more
hacking may not be one of them
scant resources or not a defector who once worked as a computer expert for the north korean government says that it has a vast network of hackers devoted to cyberwarfare against perceived enemies of the stalinist state
jang se yul who defected from north korea seven years ago told cnn that he thinks there are one thousand eight hundred cyberwarriors in the agency stationed around the world
but he says even the agents themselves don't know how many others work for the secretive group called bureau one hundred and twenty one whose mission is to conduct cyberattacks against overseas and enemy states
the south korean government thinks bureau one hundred and twenty one is the agency at the heart of numerous cyberattacks from north korea against elements in foreign countries a government official who requested to be anonymous told cnn on thursday
north korea's hacking capabilities have become a global talking point recently after a massive hack of sony pictures the studio behind the interview a comedy depicting the assassination of pyongyang's leader kim jong un
that was followed by warnings that the movie not be shown in theaters something that's a nonissue for now after sony called off its planned release wednesday
u.s. investigators say an announcement blaming pyongyang for this could come as soon as thursday
north korea's government has denied responsibility for the crippling hack even as its state news agency applauded it
the hacking into the sony pictures might be a righteous deed of the supporters and sympathizers with the dprk kcna reported
commenting generally on the north korean government's hacking arsenal jang said he thinks the reclusive east asian nation's cyberwarfare is more real and more dangerous than the regime's ability to launch a nuclear offensive even if it is the latter that has contributed to expansive sanctions other penalties and the country's isolation on the world stage
said jang this silent war the cyberwar has already begun without a single bullet fired
whether or not it's behind the sony hack south korean intelligence thinks bureau one hundred and twenty one has struck before according to the government official
south korea has repeatedly accused the north of hacking attacks including incidents in two thousand and ten and two thousand and twelve that targeted banks and media organizations
pyongyang has rejected the allegations
the biggest case became known as dark seoul a series of hacks between march and june two thousand and thirteen that targeted south korean banks and media companies
more than forty eight thousand computers were hit infecting the companies computer networks with a malicious program or malware that slowed or shut down systems
seoul's military ratcheted up its cyber alert level in response and an official south korean investigation later pinned the blame for this attack on its northern neighbor finding that many of the malignant codes employed in the attacks were similar to ones used by pyongyang previously said lee seung won an official at the south korean science ministry
a spokesman for the general staff of north korea's military called these allegations which came at a time of heightened tensions between the two longtime rivals groundless and a deliberate provocation to push the situation on the korean peninsula to an extreme phase according to kcna
assuming some of the allegations are well founded some might question how or why a country that's so poor with so few resources would devote so much to cyberwarfare
jang who says he is still in contact with at least one of bureau one hundred and twenty one's members says the answer is simple
raising cyberagents is fairly cheap
the world has the wrong view of the north korean state he adds
with that incorrect world view north korea was able to increase its ability to launch cyberattacks
jang attended north korea's military college for computer science the university of automation and worked in information services for the government before defecting
he showed cnn reams of information he says was stolen by north korean operatives from bureau one hundred and twenty one
the information taken from south korean financial institutions which jang says he got from a bureau one hundred and twenty one operation appeared to list bank accounts names and financial data
the dark seoul hacks were harmful but one analyst thinks that the sony attack if it's indeed linked to north korea represents an escalation of tactics
i think we underestimated north korea's cybercapabilities said victor cha director of asian studies at georgetown university
they certainly didn't evidence this sort of capability in the previous attacks
he called the sony hack and the studio's decision to pull the interview a big win for pyongyang
they got the u.s. government to admit that north korea was the source of this and there's no action plan
in response to it cha said
i think from their perspective in pyongyang they're probably popping the champagne corks



at the end of that summer my grandfather told his son that he would not be coming home
that he should stay in spain and wait for the rest of the family to join him
it was a long wait
it would take my grandfather more than ten years to get out of cuba
i've always wondered if that summer vacation was part of my grandfather's plan to make sure that my father would not be trapped in socialist cuba
maybe if my father had known he wasn't coming back home he would have put up a fight to stay in havana
my mother recently found that unused airline ticket sitting in a box of my father's things
the ticket to a flight that never happened is a heartbreaking slice of family history still frozen in time
for many americans the reaction to the news that the united states and cuba have announced plans to normalize relations was it's about time
for many americans cuba is nothing more than a forbidden playground with cigars rum beautiful beaches and baseball players
they want to experience a taste of this island trapped in time
they want to see the classic american cars rolling through the streets of old havana
to the families of cuban exiles the island is much more
it's a complex and sad reality
cuba is not a novelty or an unchecked box on a bucket list
cuba is the rhythmic heartbeat of a life lost long ago but still beating in our souls
castro's revolution split my family apart like so many others
i still have extended family in cuba
i've had only a few chances to spend time with them
i'm the only person in my family who has traveled to cuba since most of my family left
all my life i've wondered if this historic moment would ever come in my lifetime
in my mind it was supposed to be a moment like the berlin wall coming down
a highly anticipated event the world would watch together
but instead the news seemed to come out of thin air on the week before christmas
unexpected and unpredictable that's the way it always seems to be with cuba
with normalized relations many people want to see a boom of foreign investment led by americans flocking to a place that's been locked behind the gates of the cold war for more than fifty years
but i ask you to understand as best as i can explain the fear and apprehension this news means to many cuban exiles
people often tell me that they'd love to travel to cuba because it seems like such a fun place
i tell them of my uncle who well into his old age would wake up at four in the morning to get in line for a ration of bread
i remember the first time i visited cuba i watched my uncle come home with a piece of bread that had more in common with a hockey puck
i couldn't believe that my elderly uncle would wake up every morning to stand in line for that
people often tell me they want to walk the streets of old havana and see the crumbling buildings
i tell them of the countless young girls who work as jineteras slang for cuban prostitutes to help earn money for their families who live crammed inside those walls
it's sickening to think that so many men from around the world come to cuba for just this reason
these are the kinds of things cuban exile families think about when they think of cuba
it's overwhelming sadness
there's a very privileged class in cuba
the families of those in power live a life that rivals that of the most comfortable americans
so when cuban exiles hear of normalizing relations they worry that it's cuba's privileged class that will benefit the most at the expense of ordinary cubans
fear that the status quo will prevail
many cuban exiles feel that the castro regime has won the war for more than fifty years and that normalizing relations is another victory for a corrupt and evil dictatorship
they always win is a common sentiment among cuban exiles who have such a distrust of the castro regime
many exiles fear a wrong move will provide another victory for a dictatorship that took so much from them
for more than fifty years cuba's story has surprised and saddened many exiles and their families and we can't help but fear history will repeat itself
we see family and friends left behind on the island who've spent decades fighting and scraping for the most meager of lives
no es facil said president obama the spanish phrase often used to describe life in cuba
it translates to life is not easy
and that's putting it mildly
perhaps it's inevitable that u.s. and other foreign investment will swoop into cuba one day
maybe it's just a matter of time before a mcdonald's restaurant sits on the malecon havana's famous oceanfront boulevard just ninety miles from south florida
or maybe americans will rush in to buy up oceanfront property with amazing views on the most beautiful beaches of cuba
but i ask you this
what kind of view will ordinary cubans get 
my father didn't live long enough to see this moment
my grandparents aren't here to see it either
and most in my family have mixed emotions about what this will really mean
this christmas we'll argue about it over black beans and rice and roasted pork
the children of cuban exiles like me all dream of walking the streets of cuba with our parents and grandparents to finally feel that rhythmic beat of our cuban soul that still sits in our hearts

london's metropolitan police have opened investigations into the deaths of three young boys a probe that is tied to allegations of serious and organized sexual abuse it announced thursday
in a statement detectives involved in operation midland an investigation launched last month into sexual abuse dating back more than thirty years ago pleaded for the public's help in tracking down victims witnesses and assailants
today i want to appeal directly to those other young boys now men who were also subject to abuse at the hands of these men detective superintendent kenny mcdonald said
i believe that there were other boys who were abused or who were present whilst the abuse took place
in addition to sex abuse mcdonald said that his team is also investigating the possible murder of three young boys
our work is ongoing and we are examining reports of missing people from that time he added
to date we have not recovered any bodies
the abuse is believed to have taken place over at least a decade at various locations across london and the counties surrounding the capital including military premises the police statement said
one site for the alleged abuse is the dolphin square estate an apartment complex in pimlico central london
one witness known as nick has spoken to us
he has said he was abused from the age of seven until he was sixteen from one thousand nine hundred and seventy five one thousand nine hundred and eighty four said mcdonald
some of the abuse took place at a flat on the dolphin square estate
however i can't rule out this was the only flat used
nick has told police how a car would be sent to collect him and drive him to the apartment in dolphin square mcdonald said
the abuse he has detailed that he was subjected to was carried out by a man on his own a group of men or during what have been described as parties the officer said
police want to speak to anyone who lived in the area from the early one thousand nine hundred and seventy s onwards and may have seen something that they now realize could be significant to this investigation mcdonald said
detectives are in touch with the families of two boys one who disappeared in one thousand nine hundred and seventy nine and another who vanished and then was found murdered in one thousand nine hundred and eighty one but it is not yet possible to say if those two cases are linked to the current investigation he added

here's another scottish mystery to file alongside the loch ness monster and mel gibson's accent in braveheart
these strange frozen saucers were found during a recent cold snap near the river dee a salmon filled waterway that passes by the british queen's summer residence balmoral castle before heading eastwards to the coastal city of aberdeen
river dee trust biologist jamie urquhart made the discovery and took the photos at lummels pool birse several miles downstream of balmoral
the trust said it was initially unsure what caused the pancakes but supects they're caused by a rare phenomenon in which foam freezes in a swirling eddy
perhaps each disc grew when smaller pieces of unfrozen foam struck the disc adhered and then froze in place it wrote on its website
the raised rims are undoubtedly due to the collisions but what about the inner lines 
the air temperature was colder at night due to the clear sky conditions but warmer in the day meaning the discs may have grown at night then during the day when the discs softened in the sun further collisions between the pancakes caused the rims to be pushed up
the next night further growth would have occurred followed by a new rim the next day
the trust said it's the first time the pancakes more commonly found in the antarctic or the baltic sea have been seen on the river dee

a section of barbed wire has been cut at the top allowing some of the taliban attackers who struck tuesday to scale the wall with bamboo ladders and drop inside intent on killing
another team of militants got in further down the wall
and then they took off toward the school buildings
as they burst into the main auditorium full of children taking classes the attackers split into two teams
now the media allowed into the school by the pakistani army can see close up the carnage they wrought
overturned wooden chairs lie on the floor pools of reddish brown dried blood beneath them
more blood has pooled under red fabric covered seats set in rows
it was here that so many children cowered trying to hide under benches and chairs
a single brown shoe sits discarded under one seat the fate of its owner unknown
a brigadier was giving a lesson in first aid when the attackers charged in
bandages and other first aid equipment lie tumbled on a desk
a dummy used in class remains on the floor where the brigadier fell
they shot me as soon as they came in says seventeen year old survivor sadeel ahmed speaking from his hospital bed
we tried to run
i was shot in my shoulder
the people they came they had no sense of humanity in them
they killed little children
muslims would not do this
more puddles of drying blood and abandoned shoes lie by one of two doors through which the army says the students sought to flee the auditorium
a hundred of them were gunned down as they tried to escape in an act of cold blooded murder
it was the place where the greatest number of lives were lost
beyond the auditorium blood splatters can still be seen on the ground in all directions
not satisfied with their slaughter in the auditorium the taliban attackers went upstairs to a computer lab
pools of blood on the floor show how their young victims many of them sons and daughters of army personnel from around peshawar were sprayed with bullets as they sat at each machine
classroom after classroom tells the same brutal story
a pair of glasses on the floor here children's pencils and pens there a page from a schoolbook lying torn and crumpled
bullet holes punctuate a blackboard where the teacher would have been standing
below another gruesome red stain where the teacher fell
in the administration block where the final showdown took place between taliban militants and security forces shattered bricks by the door show where one attacker detonated his suicide vest
shrapnel from the ball bearings packed inside the vest to cause maximum harm when detonated pockmarks the wall to one side
soldiers with guns still stand guard as the media are allowed in to see the culmination of a bloody siege that lasted several hours
rubble on the far side of the room shows where another suicide bomber blew himself up leaving chaos and devastation behind
the principal's office is nearby
she also was killed one of a dozen teachers to lose their lives in the attack
right at the end of the corridor its painted walls pocked and blasted is the spot where the last suicide bomber detonated his vest
the deputy principal who hid in a room nearby survived
in the dusty sunlit yard into which the corridor opens lie the remains of the last attacker a small mound covered by a white cloth another soldier standing by
a day earlier the people of peshawar mourned as they buried their dead more than one hundred and forty of them mostly children who'd blithely left home for an ordinary day at school never to come home


the art of movement is a monthly show that highlights the most significant innovations in science and technology that are helping shape our modern world
following the devastating tsunami in two thousand and eleven the trio came together with the mission of creating something beautiful out of the turmoil
the result is an unusual musical style that blends the vocals and raw acoustic guitar of frontman shuji yamagiri with traditional japanese instruments like the three string tsugaru shamisen played by a musician known as jack
the two instrumentalists are accompanied by powerful sword dancing from lady samurai aka kaori kawabuchi
music gives me imagination or inspiration by just listening to it
it's like i tell a story by using my body kawabuchi says of dancing with a samurai sword known as a katana
i get an image from the sound by the members under the conditions on that day energy given by the audience and the atmosphere
kawabuchi's energetic sword dancing is a fluid swift selection of movements that translate the musicians deeply personal sound into a visual spectacle for the band's growing international audience
since their conception the band has played several high profile gigs outside of japan including at the venerated annual sxsw music and media festival in austin texas
they've also completed a tour of the united states as well as performed for fans at festivals in germany and england
band leader yamagiri adds
a strength and characteristic of our band is we have kawabuchi between us and through her movement she expresses the feeling of sadness and delight that we try to express in our play using her body
i think it makes it easier for an overseas audience to understand
she can deliver feminine delicacy and tenderness and also intensity which is even stronger than men

boko haram insurgents kidnapped at least one hundred and eighty five women and children and killed thirty two people in a raid in northeastern nigeria this week local officials and residents said
gunmen in pickup trucks attacked the village of gumsuri just north of chibok on sunday shooting down men before herding women and children together
they gathered the women and children and took them away in trucks after burning most of the village with petrol bombs a local government official said on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal
news of the attack took four days to emerge because of a lack of communication
telecommunications towers in the region had been disabled in previous attacks
local officials learned of the attack from residents who fled to maiduguri the capital of borno state where the officials had moved a year ago to escape boko haram attacks
the militants stormed the village from two directions overwhelming local vigilantes who had repelled boko haram attacks over the course of the year said gumsuri resident umar ari who trekked for four days to maiduguri
they destroyed almost half the village and took away one hundred and eighty five women girls and boys ari said
resident modu kalli said the militants fired heavy machine guns on the village and poured canisters of gasoline on houses before setting them on fire
we lost everything in the attack
i escaped with nothing save the clothes i have on me kalli said
hundreds of residents of gumsuri continue to arrive in maiduguri which has been struggling to accommodate thousands of residents fleeing towns and villages overrun by boko haram
meanwhile the cameroon military says that it killed at least one hundred and sixteen boko haram fighters during a fight in northern cameroon on wednesday near the border with northeastern nigeria
the incident began when the militant group tried to attack the cameroonian town of amchide military spokesman lt. col. didier badjeck said
one cameroonian soldier was killed and another was missing after the attack according to a statement released by badjeck
boko haram destroyed two trucks and stole a third badjeck said
badjeck said the military believes its artillery also inflicted unspecified damage to boko haram on the nigerian side of the border during the fight
our defense forces rigorously fought back this barbaric attack and forced the enemy to retreat cameroonian government spokesman issa tchiroma bakary said
this terrorist group has only one objective
to spread fear and uncertainty amongst our population
but i can assure you that they will be defeated bakary said
two months ago the nearby area of limani cameroon was the site of a deadly clash between boko haram and cameroonian forces
eight cameroonian soldiers and one hundred and seven boko haram fighters were killed during an attack by the militants that month cameroon state run broadcaster crtv reported citing the cameroonian defense ministry
boko haram has terrorized northern nigeria regularly since two thousand and nine attacking police schools churches and civilians and bombing government buildings
this month at least one female boko haram suicide bomber killed five people in maiduguri
last month suicide bombings killed nearly one hundred and eighty people
more than half of the victims died in an attack on a mosque that many suspect boko haram was behind
the group has targeted mainstream islam saying that it does not represent the interests of nigeria's eighty million muslims and that it perverts islam
in april boko haram militants drew international condemnation when they kidnapped more than two hundred schoolgirls many of whom they later said they sold into slavery
at least five thousand people have died at boko haram's hands according to a u.s. congressional research service report making it one of the world's deadliest terrorist organizations

the serbian capital of belgrade and the lavish claridge's hotel in the heart of london might be more than one thousand miles apart but for one day some seven decades ago the two places came much closer
on seventeen july one thousand nine hundred and forty five queen alexandria of yugoslavia gave birth to her son crown prince alexander in the hotel's two hundred and twelve suite
then british prime minister winston churchill designated the room yugoslavian territory for the day so that the baby prince could retain his right to the throne
it was an extraordinary act that he did recalls crown prince alexander
in one thousand nine hundred and forty one germany invaded and occupied yugoslavia forcing the country's king peter ii to move into exile in london
later on he was banned from returning home by the communist government that followed world war ii
alexander who was baptized by queen elizabeth and her father king george grew up abroad and only visited his country for the first time in one thousand nine hundred and ninety one
ten years later he returned to live in belgrade after the country's government decided to give him and his family the right to use the city's royal palaces which were taken from the royals when they were stripped of their possessions and citizenship by the communists
i never thought we'd come back here i really didn't he says
after decades abroad the return home signaled many first experiences for the crown prince and one of those included celebrating the patron saint day of the royal family st. andrew the first in serbia
it's even more meaningful doing it at home very much so says alexander who has today a strictly ceremonial role
the serbian orthodox religion is closely bound to the country's identity around eighty five percents of the seven point two million population declare themselves as orthodox
since his return in two thousand and one crown prince alexander has enjoyed the feast of st. andrew as an open inter faith celebration a turning point for serbian history
it's wonderful and very moving for me to see that he has accomplished that because they're all together sitting and talking to each other says the crown prince's wife her royal highness crown princess katherine
it's hard to believe this country was in conflict so many years ago and for such a long time
luckily it seems that those days are over

russia needs to keep actively guarding its sovereignty to avoid becoming like a chained bear whose captors will pull out his teeth and claws president vladimir putin said thursday
responding to a question at his annual news conference about russia's annexation of crimea putin drew an analogy with what would happen if our most recognizable symbol
the bear who guards his taiga stopped chasing pigs and sat still maybe eating berries and honey
the president pondered whether the bear would then be left alone before answering
they won't leave him alone
they are always trying to put him on a chain
they will always try to put him on a chain and as soon as he is put on this chain they will pull out his teeth and claws
in today's terms we are speaking about our nuclear deterrence
as soon as god forbid this is done the bear isn't needed anymore
once the bear had lost his teeth it might then be stuffed he concluded
putin told reporters gathered in moscow that his country was ready to mediate in the ukraine crisis and he denied that russians killed in ukraine were members of his country's military
western powers accuse russia of sending troops and equipment to help separatists in eastern ukraine in their fight against ukrainian government forces
in april violence broke out in two ukrainian regions that border russia donetsk and luhansk as separatist leaders declared independence from the government in kiev
moscow has voiced moral support for the rebels and sent aid convoys into the region but it has repeatedly denied military involvement
in his end of year news conference putin said there had been a state coup and a military coup in ukraine with which parts of that country had not agreed
he repeated the long standing russian line that any russians killed in ukraine were volunteers
putin said he hoped the situation would still be solved through dialogue rather than military means or economic blockades that were harmful to the state of ukraine the people of ukraine
the ukraine crisis must be solved and the quicker the better he said
a ceasefire deal was reached september five in minsk belarus after talks between representatives of ukraine's government russia and rebel leaders in eastern ukraine
a subsequent agreement on september nineteen in minsk set out more measures
but fighting in ukraine has since resumed with a british security official last month telling cnn that the conflict had returned to levels that preceded the ceasefire
ukrainian president petro poroshenko is striving towards a settlement of the minsk agreement putin said
our representatives in minsk signed a memorandum and the representatives of donetsk did not sign that protocol that is what it's about
the ukrainian officials are not removing their troops from the donetsk airport they are sitting there putin told reporters
the next step should be following up the minsk agreement it is important that the kiev authorities use all these agreements he said
but he also said that if ukraine wanted to restore its territorial integrity it has to be open and honest
we're not attacking anyone 
asked whether its economic problems were the price to pay for annexing crimea putin said russia was trying to maintain its sovereignty and independence
he said russia's economic woes were partially due to sanctions imposed against it
earlier putin said external economic factors provoked russia's current situation
he cited oil prices and he praised the bank of russia's intervention this week to defend the ruble
asked to comment on suspicions in the west that he was returning russia to a cold war footing putin denied that his country was an aggressor
as far as our maneuvers and exercises of the military are concerned you're saying that russia has made a big contribution to the tensions in the world he responded
russia has only made a contribution where it is supporting its national interests
we're not attacking anyone
we're not warmongers
putin said russia had stopped sending its aircraft on strategic flights in the one thousand nine hundred and ninety s and only resumed them in the last two or three years
the united states he said has continued its strategic flights despite the end of the cold war
furthermore russia has two military bases abroad
the american bases are throughout the globe and you want to say we are the aggressors 
he said
in addition putin said the pentagon's defense budget was virtually ten times more than russia's 
are we extending the borders 
who is moving the borders of nato forward the military infrastructure 
not us the russian president said
putin added that russia had not been the country to establish a missile defense system
who were the ones who wanted to set up this system of global security 
it was not us
this is a threat for us he said
in romania and poland right next to us and you are saying we are carrying out this policy
he said russia wanted to develop normal international relations and work as a partner in the areas of security and combating terror drugs crime and infectious diseases such as ebola
as putin spoke the council of the european union announced that further sanctions had been approved against crimea and sevastopol
this is to reinforce the eu's policy of not recognizing their illegal annexation by russia and follows a conclusion by the foreign affairs council of seventeen november it said in a statement
the measures would be applied starting saturday the european union said
we will get through this period 
in the final question of the more than three hour conference putin was asked whether he took personal responsibility for russia's economic issues and if he would stand in the two thousand and eighteen presidential elections
he replied that it was too early to make a decision on running and said the economic responsibility was nothing i can take on alone and i don't plan to
putin pointed to the responsibility of the central bank and different government bodies for the results of the work of each department for which they have responsibility
he ended the conference on a positive note
we will get through this period
it's not easy of course but we will strengthen our position in the world economy he said
the most important thing is to ensure social prosperity of people despite the cuts in income the budget
and we can do that we absolutely can

north korea's fury over the movie comedy the interview appears to have taken the secretive state's oversensitivity to new extremes
kim jong un's regime had already branded the film the most undisguised terrorism and a war action
now the u.s. government is set to blame pyongyang for the hacking of sony pictures the studio responsible for the movie starring seth rogen and james franco that shows the assassination of kim
sony has pulled the film after a threat was made against people going to see it in theaters
north korea has provided a new gold standard for weakness in international politics
a state that feels threatened by a seth rogen movie tweeted jennifer lind an associate professor at dartmouth college who specializes in east asian security issues
north korea reserves most of its rage for matters like u.n. sanctions over its nuclear program and u.s. south korean military drills near its borders
but the interview isn't the first case of pyongyang freaking out over seemingly innocuous things
here are some striking examples
the festive season is rarely full of cheer across the heavily armed border between north and south korea known as the demilitarized zone
christmas decorations put up on the south korean side have become a recurring sore point
pyongyang especially disliked a thirty meter tower in the shape of a christmas tree that sat atop a hill with tens of thousands of lights that could be seen from well inside north korean territory
the north reportedly said the decorations were an attempt to spread religion over the border and in two thousand and eleven threatened unexpected consequences if the lights were turned on
south korean authorities recently took down the ageing structure but they have approved plans by a christian group to build a new tower
north korea's track record of bah
humbug
goes back decades it was objecting to christmas trees at the border as long ago as the one thousand nine hundred and sixty s. a report in the new york times from one thousand nine hundred and sixty four said pyongyang had also complained about american troops throwing snowballs at north korean soldiers around the demilitarized zone
north korea is well known for its efforts to rigidly control what information from outside its borders filters through to its citizens
but that apparently doesn't stop some of them from eagerly seeking out illicit copies of tv shows from south korea and other countries
south korean dramas are reported to be particularly popular
the potential risks of watching the shows which highlight the disparities between north korea's largely impoverished population and its neighbor to the south are enormous
south korea's national intelligence service told lawmakers in october that officials from the north's ruling party had been executed by firing squad for viewing a south korean soap opera
despite the regime's draconian stance its young leader has shown plenty of enthusiasm for western culture
kim who is believed to have gone to school in switzerland has been shown watching a performance featuring disney characters and has befriended the eccentric former nba star dennis rodman
as relations between the two koreas soured in two thousand and ten after the sinking of a south korean warship seoul retaliated by broadcasting an anti north korean radio show
the broadcast opened with a pop song from the south korean girl band four minute
the south korean government also began setting up groups of huge speakers along the border to blast propaganda across into north korea something it hadn't done for years because of a thaw in relations
infuriated pyongyang threatened to bomb the loudspeaker positions and turn seoul into a sea of flame
foreign visitors to north korea face a range of tight restrictions on where they go and what they do
those limits encompass what kind of photos they take
there are many restrictions on photography that have to be obeyed in dprk warns the travel agency koryo tours using a shorthand term for north korea
photographers who have spent time in the country say that particular care must be taken when snapping pictures of statues of north korean leaders
it's seen as an insult to crop out hands feet or head when taking photos of statues or pictures of government leaders or officials olaf schuelke a documentary photographer wrote in an article for cnn
his comments were echoed by photojournalist julia leeb who told npr about her experience
you have to bow
out of respect and if you take pictures you should take the entire statue she said
you can not take a portrait for example
because it's a lack of respect
and you can not take pictures from behind
leeb also warned that you're not allowed to fold a newspaper with an image of the leader on it
ok so we're not talking about party balloons
the north korean regime regularly works itself into a lather of rage about balloons floated over the border by south korean activists
their anger is directed specifically at the cargo carried by the balloons
that can include items like dollar bills dvds and tiny am fm radios that show the prosperity in south korea as well as documents criticizing the north korean regime
the balloons sometimes even carry choco pies cheap snacks that are viewed as high value treats in north korea
the balloons drive the regime in pyongyang nuts drawing regular threats of violent reprisals
the north's state media have warned in the past of merciless strikes against the launches
in october the north korean military blasted anti aircraft rounds at one flock of balloons prompting south korea to respond with a burst of heavy machine gun fire
in a state built around an extreme personality cult other belief systems can be touchy subjects
that's what jeffrey fowle a municipal worker from ohio discovered to his considerable cost earlier this year
during a visit to the country fowle left a bible at a club for foreign sailors
north korean authorities interpreted the act as a violation of its laws and held the father of three prisoner for five months
i'd read about the persecution of the christians in the country i felt compelled to help them in some way fowle told cnn in october after he was released by north korea and flown out on a u.s. government plane
although north korea has some state controlled churches the regime forbids independent religious activities
skewering the issue with its inimitable brand of satire the onion summed up north korea's melodramatic tendencies in two thousand and six with a spoof article about kim jong un's father and predecessor entitled kim jong il interprets sunrise as act of war

suddenly an old women leaned over
before the war my brother had beautiful english shoes like yours she said
luckily none of the german soldiers overheard this conversation and he lived to fight another day
and after surviving three vichy prisons and five nazi concentration camps he became one of the most prominent fashion illustrators of his age
michel chapuis of course was not his real name
rather it was a cover used by brian stonehouse a british spy and talented artist who had parachuted into france the month before as part of the legendary special operations executive a clandestine espionage and sabotage unit
on landing in france his radio transmitter had become tangled in a tree and his first few days had been wasted trying to retrieve it without attracting attention
thereafter he had gone to ground for two weeks living on nothing but stolen peaches a diet which had left him with acute dysentery before risking the train journey to limoges to make contact with a spy network known as ventriloquist
stonehouse had been trained as a clandestine radio operator and given the codename celestin
on the train that day he was carrying a paintbox that had been specially adapted to contain a secret transmitter the one he had managed to rescue from the tree
at that time the life expectancy of an soe radio operator in occupied france was just six weeks
knowing that something as insignificant as a british button on his jacket could give the game away soe's camouflage section had painstakingly made stonehouse's clothes using french fabric styles and techniques
but for some reason he was still wearing british made shoes
he told the story to his sister but she isn't sure how the mistake occurred says philip athill managing director of the abbot and holder ltd art dealer in london who has collected stonehouse's work
maybe he was wearing french shoes to start with but they got ruined so he changed them at a safe house
either way he was lucky to escape
that stonehouse was nearly given away by his clothing is ironic
after the war he enjoyed a stellar career as a fashion illustrator becoming one of the leading artists for vogue and harper's bazaar
he even painted a portrait of britain's queen mother which hangs in the special forces club in london to this day
but this was not before he had spent almost three years in captivity
in october one thousand nine hundred and forty two the gestapo were able to triangulate his position during a secret transmission and stonehouse was arrested
he spent the rest of the war in various prisons and camps including in the notorious dachau concentration camp
he survived only because he was able to draw the guards wives and mistresses in exchange for extra food and shelter
immediately after the war stonehouse returned to dachau to make sketches of the crematoria in order to bear witness
he was also able to use his exceptional visual memory to serve his country one last time
officials from soe were trying to find out what had happened to four of their female officers
stonehouse was able to draw from memory four well dressed women that he had seen being taken to their deaths by the nazis the year before
his sketches matched their photographs
as a result their files were closed and their families were informed of their deaths
it was while stonehouse was acting as a witness at the war crimes tribunal that he met the american socialite harry haller then a major in the united states army
haller persuaded stonehouse to move to new york to join the large number of second world war migr illustrators who were shaping america's fashion trends
with haller's help stonehouse quickly became part of the high society scene rubbing shoulders with henry fonda and his fourth glamorous wife the italian baroness afdera franchetti as well as members of hemingway's circle
in one thousand nine hundred and fifty two jessica davies an editor at vogue made stonehouse the first new illustrator to be taken on by the magazine since one thousand nine hundred and thirty nine
in those days there was a belief that illustration showed how the clothes should be worn better than photography says athill
the magazines were split evenly between photographs and illustration
it was the golden age of fashion illustration
read
by the numbers
end of world war ii
stonehouse died of a heart attack in one thousand nine hundred and ninety eight and his pictures have been brought together for the first time at abbot and holder ltd where they can be purchased
they have also been collected in a new book brian stonehouse mbe one thousand nine hundred and eighteen one thousand nine hundred and ninety eight by frederic a sharf and michelle tolini finamore
normally fashion illustrations of the period were thrown away after they had been published says athill
but something inside stonehouse made him keep everything
six years ago members of his family discovered a box of his pictures and brought them to a british legion road show in bury st edmunds to be evaluated
eventually they were auctioned and i recognized their rarity and purchased them
since then athill has become increasingly fascinated with stonehouse becoming acquainted with his surviving family and several of his friends
athill believes that the same qualities lay behind stonehouse's aptitude as an artist and as a spy
he was a perennial outsider and an observer he says
he was illegitimate and was brought up largely by his mother in france and never became part of mainstream society
but despite these challenges he had shown the inner strength to remain balanced in the face of adversity
he was incredibly handsome charismatic and well liked and throughout his life people noticed him from his commanding officer to the editor of vogue
that is what must have caught the attention of british spy masters

the chinese government has pledged to protect an eight year old boy with hiv who was shunned by his entire village in the southwestern province of sichuan state media reported
a photo from a people daily's online report last week showed the boy called kunkun watching villagers unanimously vote for his removal in a meeting held in early december
even his own grandfather added his name to the petition signed by more than two hundred villagers
kunkun is diagnosed with aids causing great fear among the villagers and village children
in order to ensure the safety of villagers and children we demand that authorities quarantine kunkun for treatment the petition read
in response china's health authority promised to assure kunkun with the right to medical treatment education and a living allowance reported china daily
everyday life with an infected person doesn't affect others health and the infected person's rights are protected by laws and regulations said wu zunyou director of the national center for aids std control and prevention in a press release issued saturday
the united nations had also released a statement expressing concern over the reports on kunkun
kunkun a pseudonym used to protect his identity was expelled from school and ostracized by members of the community after he was diagnosed in two thousand and eleven said the people daily's newspaper
he's a ticking time bomb
my daughter is around his age and goes to a boarding school now
what happens if she gets bitten while playing with him here at home 
that boy is too dangerous says he jialing one of the villagers
the report said the boy contracted the disease from his mother before he was born
kunkun whose parents are migrant workers in guangzhou lives with his sixty nine year old grandfather
with no school willing to take him in he is often found roaming the streets alone
no one wants to play with me the newspaper quoted kunkun as saying
his grandfather told local media the boy's parents have stopped sending money back home since he was diagnosed
in response to the petition local authorities have stressed that kunkun's rights should be respected
they plan to launch an educational campaign hoping to reduce the stigma of people living with hiv aids
some seven hundred and eighty thousand people are living with hiv aids in china according to the latest count by the joint united nations program on hiv aids in two thousand and eleven
people living with hiv or aids in china face widespread discrimination and stigma especially in rural areas where there is a lack of education about the disease
china has sought to tackle the stigma by establishing laws and regulations prohibiting discrimination against people with hiv
china's first lady peng liyuan who was appointed world health organization's goodwill ambassador for aids in two thousand and eleven has appeared in public advertisements holding hands and playing with hiv positive children
despite china's fight against aids cases such as kunkun's suggest inconsistency with official policy

almost ten years ago to the day the world watched aghast as scenes of carnage unfolded across the countries of the indian ocean
the two thousand and four tsunami was one of the most devastating natural disasters in living memory and the donor response a huge outpouring of governmental and private support a heartening riposte to what was a hugely traumatizing event
it has provided an ideal case study for disaster relief and an oxfam report published today examines the lessons that have been learned as well as areas that the humanitarian relief sector still needs to improve upon
the tsunami which hit communities as far afield as thailand indonesia somalia and madagascar was sparked by a massive nine point one magnitude earthquake which struck off the western coast of northern sumatra indonesia
the immediate impact was devastation
a staggering five million people needed humanitarian assistance in the first few days following the incident
the hardest hit countries indonesia sri lanka india and thailand were among the poorest and the disaster only compounded the developmental and societal issues those nations were already facing
oxfam says the response to the humanitarian catastrophe was the largest ever privately funded response with private donations making up forty percents of all money raised an impressive five point four billion dollar which came close to matching government donations of six point four billion dollar
a further two billion dollar of disaster relief funding came in the form of loans and grants
oxfam itself raised two hundred and ninety four dollar m for the tsunami relief effort with over ninety percents of its funds coming from private donors
jane cocking oxfam's humanitarian director told cnn it was largely the absolutely horrific scale of the tragedy that brought out peoples generosity
people automatically empathized they came out of the blue and just wanted to help
all the things that come together to ensure that people do connect were all there it was a natural disaster it was enormous completely unexpected she said
oxfam sent aid to seven of the worst affected countries and continued to provide assistance well after the initial relief effort
the scale and effectiveness of the relief operation meant many of the countries were able to return to some semblance of normality a few short months after the disaster had such a widespread impact
in the wake of the disaster badly hit regions opted to build back better creating solid infrastructure better able to withstand earthquakes and tsunamis and investing more in emergency education and evacuation procedures
but the speed and level of funding for the disaster was unprecedented and in itself almost overwhelming
like other nongovernmental organizations oxfam soon halted fundraising for the disaster urging the public to donate to other less well publicized emergencies by mid january two thousand and five
the charity says that one of the key lessons learned from the tsunami and its aftermath is that humanitarian funding needs to become more equitable
pooled funds cocking says allow agencies like oxfam to use donations for humanitarian crises which are equally important but perhaps not as high impact
there is simply not enough money going into the humanitarian system cocking says
having donations spread out enables impartiality people in south sudan have as much right to aid as a person in the tsunami
for us to be able to allocate our funds impartiality allows us to deliver our funds in a more equitable way
the tsunami was one of the first disasters to be extensively captured on camera and the extent of media coverage makes a sizable difference to the public and governments opening their wallets oxfam says
indeed how the media has changed in its representation of natural disasters in the decade between two thousand and four and two thousand and fourteen largely comes down to the growth of social media and access to camera equipped mobile devices cocking says
the expansion of the number of people who have access to mobile technology focuses it on experience of the individual
in the one thousand nine hundred and ninety s humanitarian crisis survivors depended on organizations like oxfam to get the word out but not so much any more
now it is much more personal
oxfam's report also highlights the importance of coordination
in two thousand and four the lack of a unified plan meant that efforts were scattergun and often involved ngo workers operating outside of their main areas of expertise
oxfam notes that close to two hundred international ngos operating in aceh province alone
the charity says that in the aftermath of the tsunami it learned a great deal about inequalities exacerbated by the onset of natural disasters
women it concludes are more likely to die in such circumstances a state of affairs compounded by poverty
recruiting more female relief workers especially at the coordination level providing safe shelter and toilet facilities for women and prioritizing livelihood activities for women as well as men can reduce this disparity the report recommends
having experienced the full brunt of a disaster of this magnitude the affected countries have been urged to build back better enhancing their own preparedness to lessen the impact of future events
while the idea of a repeat of a natural disaster of this magnitude is unsettling it is heartening to know that the lessons of two thousand and four have been digested and those aid givers better equipped as a result



have no fear vladimir putin is here
that seems to be the message in an epic promo released ahead of the russian president's annual news conference as the country's economy plummets
the promotion released by a state owned russian channel has the feel of a movie trailer showing scenes of tanks crying children and plenty of putin
he declares in a particularly memorable sound bite
the bear never asks permission
that seems to be a problem these days in russia it's a bear not a bull market
putin who has held power for fifteen years is expected to address the economic problems vexing russia as falling oil prices a diving ruble and western sanctions have crippled the country's economy
moscow is trying to prevent a currency crisis turning into an economic catastrophe and finds itself more isolated than at any other point in the last twenty five years due to its actions over ukraine
russia's slide toward economic crisis and why it matters
worried that their currency is now worth less russians have been exchanging rubles for dollars and stocking up on imported goods
and russian banks and companies have lost access to western sources of finance because of sanctions imposed over ukraine but still have foreign debts to pay
yet in the lead up to putin's press conference russia channel one's glossy promo doesn't touch on any of the financial woes facing the world's ninth largest economy
the promotion shows scenes of war and triumph at this year's winter olympics in sochi as the narrator intones in a baritone about a year of tough decisions and long awaited victories
how it turned out for russia and its president he will tell himself
a defiant putin proclaims russia has never changed its orientation
putin still enjoys approval ratings in the high eighty s. his popularity surged as russia backed separatists in east ukraine and annexed crimea earlier this year

upwardly trending statistics show it's not just a meaningless crush
these newcomers many thought to be in their twenty s and thirty s and living in the nation's medium sized cities are joining a love affair that rail riders and strap hangers in chicago and the northeast have known for generations
after decades of embracing car culture experts report growing movement out of the driver's seat and into transit stations
the change is a reflection of a do more with less economy where jobs often pay less than they used to and are harder to hold onto
for many the cost of owning insuring and maintaining a vehicle outweighs the value of its function
the commuter culture got tired of traffic snarls and parking headaches
we may be seeing a statistical movement partially fueled by a generation that's more concerned than their parents about cutting air pollution
dubious 
here are five signs america may be falling in love with public transportation
the nation is on track to top two thousand and thirteen's annual ridership which was the highest since one thousand nine hundred and fifty six
third quarter figures released wednesday from the american public transportation association show rising ridership nationwide for twelve of the past fifteen quarters
from july through september of this year total u.s. trips on commuter rail subways buses streetcars and trolleys topped two point seven billion
that's an increase of one point eight one percents
the increases are happening across the country in cities such as seattle minneapolis and albany new york apta reports
some cities set records including st. petersburg florida as well as oakland california
the new figures prove a dramatic change in public attitude as more people are demanding public transportation services said michael melaniphy apta president and ceo in an e mail to cnn
and while ridership increases gasoline prices are plummeting
this week the national average for a gallon of regular unleaded gas hit two dollar point fifty five a five year low
you might think falling gasoline prices would result in a big ridership drop off as driving suddenly becomes more affordable
but according to a two thousand and twelve apta study when the cost of fuel goes down many riders tend to continue using public transit
the drop off rate from low gas prices doesn't match the ridership increase that happens when gas prices shoot sky high

americans are breaking up with their cars
since two thousand and seven americans have been driving less breaking a trend that had been rising for more than two decades
in addition an october report from consumer group u.s. pirg shows driving and car ownership is trending down among younger americans and is likely to keep doing so
some commuters may be dumping their cars to save money
the public transportation industry says commuters could gain an average annual savings of nine thousand six hundred and thirty five dollar by taking public transit instead of driving

cities think streetcars and trolleys are totally hot
in oregon portland's success with its streetcars in the early two thousand s helped spur similar projects around the nation
new streetcar projects are in service under construction or being planned in atlanta
charlotte north carolina
cincinnati
dallas
detroit
kansas city missouri
salt lake city
tucson arizona
and washington
streetcars can create economic growth by attracting shoppers from outlying areas to downtown
critics aren't so sure
they talk about the cost of streetcar infrastructure and they wonder how efficient streetcars can be if ridership isn't constantly high
several city planners are pinning their hopes on spectacular new transportation facilities that combine transportation with other activities such as shopping and eating
one of these just opened this month in anaheim california
it's called the artic anaheim regional transportation intermodel center knbc reports
it boasts access to buses and regional and interstate rail lines
it's got bike lockers for the two wheeled traveler
price tag
one hundred and eighty million dollar
similar facilities are proposed in san francisco the chronicle reports and in newport news virginia according to wavy
near denver a project is under construction which aims to connect the airport a new westin hotel and an eighty two thousand square foot plaza to the city via a new rail line
critics fear it will balloon well beyond its five hundred million dollar plus budget the denver post reported
in denver's lower downtown district the city unveiled its renovated union station transportation center earlier this year
it's already been credited with spurring a rise in ridership
denver regional transportation district ceo phillip washington said the revamped station makes the city the mother of all transit oriented communities
in south florida the miami intermodal center expected to be finished soon will mashup just about every mode of transportation possible
airport amtrak local rail rental cars and buses the miami herald reports
these days jobs are where you find them not necessarily where you live
supporters say the need for faster affordable mass transit between nearby cities has never been greater
utah transit authority's light rail line called trax has connected communities within the sprawling salt lake county for fifteen years
since two thousand and eight the uta intercity commuter railroad called frontrunner has reached out ever farther with a corridor connecting provo salt lake city and pleasant view along about ninety miles of track
now commuter rail lines have been proposed connecting other regional cities such as chicago with st. louis dallas with houston and orlando's airport with downtown miami

jordan axani planned to travel around the world with his girlfriend elizabeth gallagher until they broke up
now he'll embark on sunday on the circumnavigation with elizabeth gallagher
no need for a double take
the name may be the same but the person answering to it isn't
axani had booked his and her airline tickets in his name and his girlfriend's he said
so after his ex went overboard he had to find a new co passenger with the same name he said because the tickets were non transferable
axani is canadian as is his ex so the new elizabeth gallagher needed to be too to make the switch work
so he took to social messaging service reddit to find her
after threw out the offer in early november for a free round the world trip social media posts avalanched down at the hashtag elizabethgallagher
elizabeth quinn gallagher from nova scotia quickly tweeted axani a photo of her passport
scrawled on the shot in hot pink the words take me
he did he announced on wednesday but though quinn came at him straight out of the chute making the final choice wasn't that simple axani said in a statement
many deserving women had contacted him
some of their stories told of such compelling real life heartbreak and perseverance that axani started a crowd funding initiative a ticket forward to buy trips around the world for them too
the first four he hopes to fund are a victim of lymphoma a single mother with an autistic son and two women who fled violence in their native countries
but axani settled on quinn from cole harbour nova scotia as his travel partner
he said she stood out with her volunteer work at a homeless shelter and her wish to become a social worker
from the get go axani told prospective eg's that he would put no pressure on them to do him any favors
he was not looking for his ex's doppelganger to mend a broken heart
i am not looking for anything in return
i am not looking for companionship romance drugs a trade or to take selfies with you in front of the christmas market in prague he wrote
but he had nothing against a few bills to sooth the financial pain
if you feel compelled to toss me a couple hundred bucks great
really the only thing i ask for is that you enjoy this trip and that it bring you happiness
axani and elizabeth quinn gallagher are to depart new york city on sunday for milan italy
from there the two will hop to prague paris bangkok new delhi and back to axani's home of toronto provided canadian authorities allow the new elizabeth gallagher to board with the ticket booked for the ex
cnn has reached out to the canadian air transport security authority to find out whether they have any security measures in place that would prevent elizabeth gallagher two point zero from traveling

just ninety miles away cuba inevitably shares a long history with the united states from conquistadors to the spanish american war to the cold war
here are some of the top moments in that history even before the countries came into being
christopher columbus lands on cuba in one thousand four hundred and ninety two and claims the island for spain leading the way for that country's conquistadors to explore the caribbean and the part of the u.s. southeast that's now florida among other parts of the americas
the united states helps cuba win independence from spain in a war between the european country and the americans in one thousand eight hundred and ninety eight
in one of the more famous moments theodore roosevelt and his rough riders charge up cuba's kettle hill during the battle of santiago and the so called one st volunteer cavalry become instant heroes
the united states is given temporary control of cuba under the treaty of paris and roosevelt later becomes u.s. president
the u.s. occupation of cuba lasts until one thousand nine hundred and two during which u.s. forces modernize the capital's infrastructure
by one thousand nine hundred and three the new republic of cuba allows for the creation of a u.s. naval base in guantanamo bay in one thousand nine hundred and three whose military moniker becomes gitmo
in one thousand nine hundred and fifty nine fidel castro his brother raul and their band of bearded guerrillas stage a successful communist revolution overthrowing president fulgencio batista a u.s. ally
fidel castro goes on to become one of the world's longest ruling leaders for more than fifty years and one of the most vocal critics of capitalism and u.s. policies
after the cuban revolution leads to the nationalization of about one billion dollar of u.s. owned property on the island the u.s. government imposes a trade embargo on cuba in one thousand nine hundred and sixty that's designed to destabilize the communist regime
the castros refer to this sanction as a blockade that they claim causes many of cuba's problems
the united states and cuba come to the brink of nuclear war following a series of events that begins when u.s. backed cuban exiles invade the island at the bay of pigs
but the exiles suffer a crushing defeat in one thousand nine hundred and sixty one embarrassing the u.s. government
the following year cuba allows the soviet union to build missile installations on the isle a major crisis in the cold war
the standoff ends when the soviet union withdraws the missiles and the americans promise not to invade cuba
secretly washington also agrees to remove u.s. ballistic missiles deployed in turkey against the soviets
flotillas of rafts and boats carry a mass movement of refugees from cuba to florida in one thousand nine hundred and eighty
in all about one hundred and twenty four thousand cuban migrants take to the water and enter the united states
fidel castro enabled the exodus by allowing his people to leave cuba freely from the port of mariel
only five elian gonzalez is the only boat survivor of a group of refugees fleeing cuba to florida in one thousand nine hundred and ninety nine
an international incident erupts during a custody battle between the boy's father in cuba and his relatives in the united states
at gunpoint u.s. agents remove the boy from his great uncle's home and elian is returned to cuba in two thousand
after the september eleven two thousand and one attacks on the united states president george w. bush uses the guantanamo bay naval base as a detention facility for terror suspects
at its height the facility hold more than seven hundred and fifty detainees and becomes a flashpoint of controversy about its legality as a prison and about alleged mistreatment of detainees
under an agreement the u.s. government sends cuba about four thousand and eighty five dollar a year to lease the land
fidel castro however is said to have called the u.s. base in guantanamo a dagger plunged into the cuban soil and the last time cuba took the u.s. payments was in one thousand nine hundred and fifty nine when the castros took power

gayle tzemach lemmon is a fellow and deputy director of the women and foreign policy program at the council on foreign relations
she wrote the dressmaker of khair khana a book that tells the story of an afghan girl whose business created jobs and hope during the taliban years
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author
all around me my friends were lying injured and dead
these are not the confessions of a battle hardened soldier who signed up to fight in his nation's war
they are the words of a fifteen year old boy lying in a hospital bed in peshawar pakistan after taliban militants attacked his school in an act of savagery so bloody and brazen it seized the attention of a world grown nearly indifferent to the barbarism vying regularly for its attention
at a time of playground bombings in syria kidnapped schoolgirls in nigeria girls schools shuttered under threat in afghanistan and conflicts descending into chaos in real time the attack on the pakistan's army public school brought home once again the danger children face simply for the act of heading to school
are we ready to watch schools become the new front lines 
it is a question we all must answer
the peshawar attack was not a one off
it was simply larger and even more horrific than previous carnage
in two thousand and thirteen seventy eight attacks against schools teachers and schoolchildren were reported to the united nations in pakistan a news release from the u.n.'s special representative for children and armed conflict noted
this morning condemnations poured in including one from a global leader who knows firsthand such deadly violence
i condemn these atrocious and cowardly acts nobel peace prize winner malala yousafzai said in a statement
two years ago the taliban shot the pakistani teenager at close range on her school bus in retaliation for her eloquent advocacy for girls education in swat valley in the province of khyber pakhtunkhwa
its capital is peshawar site of tuesday's attack
nor is the violence new
armed conflict increasingly has made the world's children its front lines
in a wrenching interview a girl named margaret tells of being abducted from her girls school in northern uganda in two thousand and four at fourteen by soldiers for joseph kony
she was forced to become his sex slave and to bear his children one of countless children forced into soldiering and slavery by kony's lord's resistance army
as schools become battlefields the need to protect them has never been greater
indeed education is one of the most potent weapons in the fight for global stability and security
another nobel prize winner economist amartya sen has written that there is no clearer route to economic development and ultimately to peace than education
in two thousand and eleven fifty seven million children were out of school
half of them in countries that are home to armed conflict
and that should concern everyone who wants to see a world that is stable peaceful and secure
and yet today in syria millions of refugee children remain out of school
a no lost generation campaign to fund education and support for these children is under way but remains vastly underfunded
before the war almost all of syria's children were enrolled in school according to the charity save the children
today syria now has the second worst enrollment rate in the world with almost three million school aged syrian children no longer in school
at an event in september hosted by u.n. education envoy gordon brown frustration was palpable
everyone agreed that education was key to guaranteeing that millions of syrian children had a chance at a future
but getting the world to open up its wallet when it came to keeping them in any kind of classroom has proved more challenging
one of the people fighting for that safer world is beatrice ayuru byaruhanga founder of the lira integrated school in once violence riddled northern uganda
herself a groundbreaker as a woman who graduated from college ayuru grew and sold cassava to fund a school that would fight illiteracy and poverty and battle for the rights of children to stay in the classroom
during the war we would always run with the children from school to the town to hide them ayuru told a reporter
then during the day we collected them from town again to come and have lessons
ayuru would not be cowed by the violence around her
nor would malala yousafzai
i along with millions of others around the world mourn these children my brothers and sisters but we will never be defeated yousafzai said in her statement
that resolve will be required for the fight ahead
the militants have shown they will stop at nothing to take the fight to the pakistani army
and they have made clear the stakes
those who care about the future not just of their own children but the stability and prosperity of the world they will inherit must agree that the world needs a lot more malalas and beatrice ayurus if there are to be fewer blood soaked days like today
and they must fund support and speak out for the right of every child to have a classroom that does not double as a battle zone
it is a shared fight
and one in which we all have a stake

five men are tasting freedom for the first time in years including one president barack obama described as one of the most important intelligence agents that the united states has ever had in cuba in a historic deal between the u.s. and cuba announced wednesday
the still unidentified spy was released along with alan gross the american subcontractor held for five years in cuba despite persistent and very public pushes for his release
the intelligence agent was part of a deal that exchanged him for three convicted cuban spies who are now back home in cuba
all five of the released men are now part of a bigger story one that speaks to the long held rivalry between the united states and cuba that is now being rewritten as the two countries revamp diplomatic relations
who are these men 
what did they do 
and what can they look forward to now that they're free 
the most significant person to be freed may be the only one who hasn't been named and about whom least is known
he is a u.s. intelligence agent who spent nearly twenty years in a cuban prison before his release
but why 
this man whose sacrifice has been known to only a few provided america with the information that led us to arrest the network of cuban agents that included the men transferred to cuba today as well as other spies in the united states obama said wednesday
this man is now safely on our shores
according to the office of the director of national intelligence this cuban national provided the u.s. government with information that was instrumental in the identification and disruption of several cuban intelligence operatives in the united states and ultimately led to
successful federal espionage prosecutions
specifically the u.s. intelligence office tied this unnamed spy to the conviction of one time defense intelligence agency senior analyst ana belen montes who was sentenced to twenty five years after pleading guilty of spying for the cuban government in two thousand and two
he's also tied to the case of ex state department official walter kendall myers and his wife gwendolyn who pleaded guilty in two thousand and nine for illegally aiding the cuban government for decades
the unnamed agent also played a role in helping federal authorities go after the florida based wasp network including members of the cuban five
three of those five were released in exchange for this intelligence agent as part of wednesday's deal
securing his release from prison after twenty years in a swap for three of the cuban spies he helped put behind bars is fitting closure to this cold world chapter of u.s. cuban relations the dni office said
though the sixty five year old gross has been detained for less time than the others freed as part of the u.s. cuba exchange his plight probably has been the most widely reported thanks to his family's public campaign for his release
a subcontractor for the u.s. agency for international development gross went to cuba purportedly to bring the internet to the caribbean nation's small jewish community despite the havana government's restrictions on internet access
his two day march two thousand and eleven trial took place behind closed doors ending with his conviction for allegedly trying to set up an internet network for cuban dissidents to promote destabilizing activities and subvert constitutional order
this month his wife judy gross said her husband spent five years
literally wasting away
alan is done
she urged u.s. president barack obama to bring alan gross back home saying otherwise it will be too late
while the others were swapped as part of a deal the cuban government says that gross was let go unilaterally on humanitarian grounds
hernandez led the group known as cuban five who were arrested in one thousand nine hundred and ninety eight and convicted of espionage in two thousand and one for gathering intelligence in miami
he got special treatment in u.s. courts two life sentences in fact compared to the others charged
this came after guilty verdicts on charges that included conspiracy to commit murder for engineering the downing of two planes flown in one thousand nine hundred and ninety six by the exile group brothers to the rescue
according to the national committee to free the cuban five hernandez and the others were falsely accused by the u.s. government of committing espionage conspiracy against the united states and other related charges
the five's actions were never directed at the u.s. government
that website claims the now forty nine year old havana born hernandez is a cartoonist humorist and a cuban military veteran who after his conviction was held in a federal prison in victorville california
he went on fifty four combat missions one of them as part of cuban forces fighting against apartheid era south african forces in angola
also known as ramon labanino medina belonged to the cuban five
during their trial he and others said their mission was to gather intelligence in miami to defend cuba from anti castro groups they feared would attack the island
he got life plus eighteen years though his sentence was changed to thirty years in late two thousand and nine according to the national committee to free the cuban five website
medina was serving his sentence in ashland kentucky
the now fifty one year old grew up in cuba's capital even graduating with first class honors with an economics degree from the university of havana the free the cuban five site says
a talented athlete he has three daughters ages sixteen to twenty five from two different marriages according to the site
guerrero was the other member of the cuban five to be released not including other members ruben campa and rene gonzalez who was let go in two thousand and eleven
unlike the other five guerrero was born in miami in one thousand nine hundred and fifty eight though he and his parents moved to their native cuba the following year says the national committee to free the cuban five website
an airfield construction engineer schooled in ukraine when it was part of the soviet union
he proceeded to work on the expansion of the airport in santiago de cuba and in his free time engaged in art and poetry according to the free the cuban five website
re sentenced in two thousand and nine to nearly twenty two years according to that site guerrero leaves incarceration in marianna florida to reunite with his two sons ages twenty two and twenty seven

vital signs is a monthly program bringing viewers health stories from around the world
the mosquito borne chikungunya virus has long been diagnosed in travelers returning from countries in asia and africa where the disease is widespread
but in december two thousand and thirteen the first people infected by mosquitoes local to the region were reported on the caribbean island of saint martin
this was the first outbreak of the debilitating disease in the western hemisphere health officials said
all countries in central america have now reported local transmission of chikungunya pronounced chik un goon ya and the united states had eleven confirmed cases of local infection this year as of december twelve all in florida
there also have been one thousand nine hundred imported cases across the united states in returning travelers
it wasn't until two thousand and thirteen that unfortunately a traveler resulted in local transmission of chikungunya said erin staples of the u.s. centers for disease control and prevention referring to the people infected in saint martin
those infected carry the virus in their bloodstream
it can then be picked up by mosquitoes as they bite making them carriers
the virus has since spread rapidly and shows no signs of leaving as ecological conditions are perfect for the disease to flourish
we knew it would spread said staples a medical epidemiologist
the big question perplexing officials
why now 
two mosquito species primed to the temperatures of central and south america carry chikungunya
the species aedes aegypti and aedes albopictus also carry the virus behind dengue fever
given the level of dengue in the region we knew there could be the same levels of chikungunya staples said
both diseases can cause joint pain and inflammation headaches rashes and fever and can lead to death in rare cases
but this tropical disease with an exotic name causes more intense joint pain and inflammation
for some people the pain can last for months or years resulting in additional psychological strain
the lack of immunity among people living in the americas provided a blank canvas for chikungunya to spread throughout the population this year
as of december twelve more than one point zero three million people have been infected in addition to the one hundred and fifty five who died according to the pan american health organization
almost all of the fatalities occurred in the caribbean island countries of guadeloupe and martinique
where we saw the biggest jump was after it reached the spanish speaking countries in the region said staples referring to the weakened infrastructures and health systems of countries such as the dominican republic which has reported more than five hundred and twenty thousand cases more than half of the overall outbreak and five percents of the island country's population
as south american countries approach their summer numbers are expected to rise there as the mosquitoes flourish in the heat
brazil peru paraguay are coming into their summer months and reporting their first local transmission staples said
already more than two thousand people have been infected in brazil
is there cause for concern 
because infection with chikungunya is rarely fatal the issue of most concern to officials is the burden on health services and the impact of the debilitating symptoms on the economy
the high number of cases can overload health services says dr. pilar ramon pardo regional adviser for paho the regional office of the world health organization
until recently monitoring for chikungunya was not part of routine surveillance in the region
clinicians have to be ready to diagnose she said
about twenty percents to thirty percents of cases are expected to become chronic with symptoms such as arthritis and other rheumatic manifestations leading to physical disabilities ramon pardo said
further long term effects are psychological as people become more depressed and tired
all of this can result in missed work and lower school attendance she said hurting local economies
is it here to stay 
the warm climate of the region offers potential for chikungunya levels to be maintained for years to come just like dengue fever
but areas of most concern are the tropics
the areas which have year round favorable climate for the mosquito are at the greatest risk says dr. laith yakob of the london school of hygiene and tropical medicine which is monitoring the spread of the outbreak
while the climate and mosquitos have long been present ramon pardo said we don't know why this is happening now
she said globalization is likely to blame with increased population movement from one country to another
this offers more opportunities for local mosquitos to bite infected humans
the cdc's staples said she is temporarily at ease regarding numbers in the u.s. we're moving into fall and winter periods which should see activity decrease she said
cold temperatures reduce mosquito survival rates
the rapid spread of chikungunya this year also could help minimize future infections
chikungunya will go through a region quite rapidly and create a level of population immunity which helps mitigate large outbreaks of the disease staples said
unlike dengue infection with chikungunya results in lifelong immunity
like many other infections chikungunya could however remain in the background through animals capable of carrying the virus in their bloodstream and acting as so called reservoirs of the disease
in asia and africa there is a transmission cycle in small mammals and monkeys ramon pardo said meaning these animals keep the virus present within the population
in the americas
we don't know yet
those words we don't know resonate throughout the community of scientists and government officials trying to control the outbreak
the future risk of spread levels of future immunity risk from animal reservoirs why this is only happening now and the total economic impact are all unknown
mathematical models are under construction by numerous research groups around the world to improve confidence over projections of future spread said yakob whose team is modeling the disease
as they work control efforts continue
getting it under control
when it comes to controlling chikungunya there are two main strategies reduce the likelihood of bites and remove the ever biting mosquito
prevention is the priority
unlike the mosquitoes behind malaria which bite at night the species behind chikungunya bite any time day or night
those living in affected areas are asked to use repellent sleep under bed nets and wear long clothing to avoid getting bitten
the air conditioned and indoor environments of people living in the u.s. mean numbers are likely to stay low there
but mosquito control is at the heart of it all
mass spraying of insecticides and removal of any sources of shallow water in which mosquitoes can breed are taking place across the continents
according to the cdc's staples florida has been highly aggressive with its approach to control
we're only at eleven due to such proactive measures staples said
for now prevention is all they have as officials wait and see how the outbreak pans out
there is no vaccine currently and no good antivirals so we are trying to control the spread of the disease staples said
there are a lot of questions and only time will tell what we'll see for chikungunya in the future

u.s. contractor alan gross held by the cuban government since two thousand and nine was freed wednesday as part of a landmark deal with cuba that paves the way for a major overhaul in u.s. policy toward the island senior administration officials tell cnn
president barack obama spoke with cuban president raul castro tuesday in a phone call that lasted about an hour and reflected the first communication at the presidential level with cuba since the cuban revolution according to white house officials
obama announced gross release and the new diplomatic stance at noon in washington
at around the same time cuban president raul castro was set to speak in havana
president obama announced a major loosening of travel and economic restrictions on the country
and the two nations are set to re open embassies with preliminary discussions on that next step in normalizing diplomatic relations beginning in the coming weeks a senior administration official tells cnn
talks between the u.s. and cuba have been ongoing since june of two thousand and thirteen and were facilitated by the canadians and the vatican in brokering the deal
pope francis the first pope from latin america encouraged obama in a letter and in their meeting this year to renew talks with cuba on pursuing a closer relationship
gross humanitarian release by cuba was accompanied by a separate spy swap the officials said
cuba also freed a u.s. intelligence source who has been jailed in cuba for more than twenty years although authorities did not identify that person for security reasons
the u.s. released three cuban intelligence agents convicted of espionage in two thousand and one
the developments constitute what officials called the most sweeping change in u.s. policy toward cuba since one thousand nine hundred and sixty one when the embassy closed and the embargo was imposed
officials described the planned actions as the most forceful changes the president could make without legislation passing through congress
read
he will not endure another year says wife of imprisoned american
for a president who took office promising to engage cuba the move could help shape obama's foreign policy legacy
we are charting a new course toward cuba a senior administration official said
the president understood the time was right to attempt a new approach both because of the beginnings of changes in cuba and because of the impediment this was causing for our regional policy
gross was arrested after traveling under a program under the u.s. agency for international development to deliver satellite phones and other communications equipment to the island's small jewish population
cuban officials charged he was trying to foment a cuban spring
in two thousand and eleven he was convicted and sentenced to fifteen years in prison for attempting to set up an internet network for cuban dissidents to promote destabilizing activities and subvert constitutional order
after losing hope and health in cuba gross finally released
senior administration officials and cuba observers have said recent reforms on the island and changing attitudes in the united states have created an opening for improved relations
u.s. and cuban officials say washington and havana in recent months have increased official technical level contacts on a variety of issues
obama publicly acknowledged for the first time last week that washington was negotiating with havana for gross release through a variety of channels
we've been in conversations about how we can get alan gross home for quite some time obama said in an interview with fusion television network
we continue to be concerned about him
sen. jeff flake r ariz. and rep. chris van hollen gross maryland congressman are on the plane with alan gross and his wife judy according to government officials
the group of members left at four a.m
et wednesday from washington for cuba
gross lawyer scott gilbert told cnn last month the years of confinement have taken their toll on his client
gross has lost more than one hundred pounds and is losing his teeth
his hips are so weak that he can barely walk and he has lost vision in one eye
he has also undertaken hunger strikes and threatened to take his own life
with gross health in decline a bipartisan group of sixty six senators wrote obama a letter in november two thousand and thirteen urging him to act expeditiously to take whatever steps are in the national interest to obtain gross's release
the three cubans released as a part of the deal belonged the so called cuban five a quintet of cuban intelligence officers convicted in two thousand and one for espionage
they were part of what was called the wasp network which collected intelligence on prominent cuban american exile leaders and u.s. military bases
the leader of the five gerardo hernandez was linked to the february one thousand nine hundred and ninety six downing of the two civilian planes operated by the u.s. based dissident group brothers to the rescue in which four men died
he is serving a two life sentences
luis medina also known as ramon labanino
and antonio guerrero have just a few years left on their sentences
the remaining two rene gonzalez and fernando gonzalez were released after serving most of their fifteen year sentences and have already returned to cuba where they were hailed as heroes
wednesday's announcement that the u.s. will move toward restoring diplomatic ties with cuba will also make it easier for americans to travel to cuba and do business with the cuban people by extending general licenses officials said
while the more liberal travel restrictions won't allow for tourism they will permit greater american travel to the island
secretary of state john kerry has also been instructed to review cuba's place on the state sponsors of terrorism list potentially paving the the way a lift on certain economic and political sanctions
the revised relationship between the u.s. and cuba comes ahead of the march two thousand and fifteen summit of the americas where the island country is set to participate for the first time
in the past washington has vetoed havana's participation on the grounds it is not a democracy
this year several countries have said they would not participate if cuba was once again barred
while only congress can formally overturn the five decades long embargo the white house has some authorities to liberalize trade and travel to the island
the one thousand nine hundred and ninety six helms burton act which enshrined the embargo into legislation allows for the president to extend general or specific licenses through a presidential determination which could be justified as providing support for the cuban people or democratic change in cuba
both presidents clinton and obama exercised such authority to ease certain provisions of the regulations implementing the cuba sanctions program
in an effort to boost the nascent cuban private sector the president will also allow expanded commercial sales and exports of goods and services to cuba particularly building materials for entrepreneurs and private residences and allow greater business training as well as permit greater communications hardware and services to go to the island
other announced changes permit u.s. and cuban banks to build relationships and travelers to use credit and debit cards
u.s. travelers will be allowed to import up to four hundred dollar worth of goods from cuba including one hundred dollar in alcohol and tobacco even cuban cigars
remittances by americans to their families back in cuba will also be increased to approximately two thousand dollar per quarter
officials stressed the moves were not being undertaken to prop up the castro regime but rather to encourage further reforms on the island
none of this is seen as a reward
all of this is seen as a way of promoting change in cuba because everything we have done in the past has demonstrably failed another senior administration official said
this is not the u.s. government saying cuba has gotten so much better
it is still an authoritarian state and we still have profound differences with this government
but if we hope for change with cuba we must try for a different approach
and we believe that considerably more engagement with the cuban people and the cuban government is the way to do that the official said adding that the united states will not for a moment lessen our support for improvement in human rights
to that end cuba has agreed to release fifty three political prisoners from a list of names provided by the united states
at least one of the prisoners has already been released
havana has also agreed to permit significant access by its citizens to the internet and allow the international committee of the red cross and united nations human rights officials back on the island for the first time in years
talks on a deal began between senior white house and cuban officials last year and happened in fits and starts officials said
the officials praised the role the vatican played as guarantor of the process
officials would not reveal the name of the u.s. intelligence source but officials said he was the individual who revealed to the u.s. the wasp network which included the cuban five
he was a very important hero the u.s. official said
the moves are far more sweeping than the last action obama took toward cuba in january two thousand and eleven when he eased restrictions on travel to and from the island
relations have been largely frozen since gross conviction and the white house has made his release a condition of improved ties
in two thousand and thirteen obama drew praise from advocates of changing u.s. policy toward cuba when he said the u.s. had to be creative and thoughtful about fostering change on the island
the notion that the same policies that we put in place in one thousand nine hundred and sixty one would somehow still be as effective as they are today in the age of the internet and google and world travel doesn't make sense obama said at a november two thousand and thirteen fundraiser in florida
we have to continue to update our policies

it's a roof for many different activities says maja lalic the creative force behind mikser house
it's basically connecting creative people of very different disciplines but with a similar goal and desire to be productive and constructive continues lalic an ivy league educated architect
these small scale skills of surviving and being able to make something out of nothing this kind of bitter sweet attitude to life and we used to say who if not us and when if not now 
such a transformation is not new in belgrade a city that has been destroyed and rebuilt some forty times throughout its long and tumultuous history
lying at the confluence of the great danube and sava rivers belgrade home today for some one point five million people is strategically located at the crossroads between eastern and western europe and a meeting point of different civilizations
nowhere is belgrade's historical and cultural significance more evident than in the imposing ancient fortress that towers over the point where the danube and sava rivers mingle
standing in some form since the second century on top of a cliff like ridge the sprawling castle has over the years sheltered serbian roman byzantine and ottoman troops to name just a few
belgrade was so many times conquered pulled down and built again so that is why we have so many layers and every of those people left its marks on the ground of this city says art historian bojana ibrajter gazibara surrounded by a cluster of ancient statues and elaborate headstones that dot an old gunpowder storage room deep inside the fortress
now a historical monument that encompasses a large park the fortress is a popular destination for locals and tourists thanks to its charming walking paths and spectacular river views
it's also the ideal location for dragan trifunovic the owner pilot of helivideo who often comes here to fly his camera mounted drone and capture belgrade's grand picture as well as its continuous rebuilding
when i was kid i always dreamed how it would be nice to be able to fly and to see what birds can see and with this equipment my dreams came true says trifunovic adding that the breathtaking shots give people more pride in their city
people are very proud to live in this city and to see it from another angle he says

two years after its launch mdundo a kenya based online music distributor has grown into a major provider of east african music with a twenty thousand track strong library on its mobile web platform
currently growing by over two hundred songs each week the company says some six thousand artists have so far signed up to the service
customers can download old and new tracks for free within a limit or pay three hundred kenyan shillings a month for unlimited access without adverts
unsurprisingly mdundo accepts payment in the mobile currency m pesa or safaricom airtime
aside from providing a useful service for music loving mobile users mdundo is also helping to raise the profile of east african artists
lesser known singers rappers and bands can reach a wider audience by signing up and uploading their tracks
they can also monitor downloads and get paid a share of the revenue from those downloads
there are no central rights holders of music in africa and it's therefore extremely hard to manage rights and offer a complete library to the consumers says ceo and co founder martin nielsen
for that reason illegal sites normally have the biggest library because they don't clear any rights
mdundo is funded by google backed eighty eight mph a seed fund and accelerator that focuses on investing in web and mobile startups that target the african markets
the business started as a conversation between founders francis amisi and martin nielsen and investors eighty eight mph
four months later the team had recruited eleven more members and created a beta version of mdundo
after a month in december two thousand and twelve the service officially launched in partnership with airtel kenya
in two thousand and thirteen one thousand east african artists signed up to the service and more than one million kenyan shillings was paid to artists in royalties
the company places adverts in the music as another revenue stream capitalizing on its reported reach of twenty thousand active users per week
and now with advertising clients including microsoft samsung and nokia six thousand artists signed up and two hundred and fifty thousand people having downloaded music the startup has ambitious plans for the future
within the past twelve months mdundo's library has been five doubling and is now including music from more than twelve african countries says nielsen

the gunman behind the deadly siege of a cafe in sydney this week was not on a security watch list and australia's prime minister wants to know why
tony abbott said wednesday that the system fell short
there's no doubt about that and this is why we've got to constantly learn the lessons of everything that happens he told the australian broadcasting corporation
we've got to be constantly asking ourselves
is this the best we can do 
and frankly we've got to always be better at this because if we aren't good at this our people suffer
and the tragedy of this atrocity is that two delightful australians two very decent people are dead
others are injured
others are traumatized because of a madman who was roaming our streets the prime minister said
his office announced that authorities will carry out an urgent review into the hostage taking and what lessons can be learned from the events leading up to and surrounding the siege
at a news conference later wednesday abbott told australians i will not rest until i am confident that you are as safe as any government can possibly make you
a report on the conclusions of the review is due by the end of january
authorities have identified the gunman as man haron monis an iranian born refugee who was granted political asylum in australia
he seized control of the lindt chocolate cafe in the heart of sydney's central business district and held it for some sixteen hours
the siege ended when police stormed the cafe early tuesday
the gunman was killed but so were two hostages katrina dawson a thirty eight year old barrister and mother of three and tori johnson the manager of the cafe
monis was on bail for violence criminal offenses at the time of the attack
he had a long history of mental illness and violence the prime minister said
this was the act of someone who was way beyond any mainstream any mainstream and has been rightly absolutely repudiated by all the communities of australia abbott told the australian broadcaster
we want to know why he wasn't being monitored given his history of violence his history of mental instability and his history of infatuation with extremism
at the news conference in canberra later in the day he also raised questions about how monis was able to obtain permanent residency in australia as well as welfare benefits
i share the exasperation of the australian public at what appears to be someone who's been having a lend of us for many years abbott told reporters
he also said that the gunman had a firearms license but the australian federal police later clarified that that wasn't true
the federal police who had originally given abbott the erroneous information said the confusion arose from an entry in a national database that was now being investigated
at the news conference abbott said he also wanted to know why monis seemed to have fallen off australian security agencies watch lists in two thousand and nine
but he offered little in the way of details about what took place in the final hours of the siege
when you are in a firefight all sorts of things happen abbott told reporters
the important thing for the police in a situation like that is to take care of the terrorist as quickly as possible
he said that on the police's advice he had refused to act on the gunman's demand to talk to him during the siege
as authorities work to find the answer to that and other unanswered questions a makeshift memorial has sprung up in sydney as people come to pay tribute to the victims
thousands of people have left flowers cards and signed condolence books
we're a country that is not innocent of these issues kim beazley australian ambassador to the united states told cnn's the lead with jake tapper on wednesday
we are well prepared in many ways but we weren't well prepared enough for this particular man in this particular place and that will require investigation he said

afghan security forces stormed a bank branch besieged by insurgents in helmand province wednesday ending a deadly attack police said
five civilians one police officer and two army soldiers were killed said farid ahmad obaid a spokesman for the police chief of southern helmand province
fourteen others nine civilians among them were wounded obaid said
he warned that the death toll could go up since at least one of those injured was in critical condition
the taliban claimed responsibility for the attack on the kabul bank office in the provincial capital of lashkar gah
taliban spokesman qari yousuf ahmadi said via twitter that the target was afghan security forces personnel who were visiting the bank to receive their monthly salary
all the attackers were killed in the operation to end the siege obaid said
the four armed insurgents attacked shortly before noon he said
the first attacker who was riding a motorbike blew himself up outside the bank branch while three others stormed inside the building he said
obaid said the gunbattle between the afghan security forces and the assailants lasted about ninety minutes before the militants were killed
meanwhile a suspected drone strike tuesday killed eleven taliban in afghanistan's eastern nangarhar province near the border with pakistan a local afghan government official told cnn on wednesday
among those killed in the strike in sherzad district were four pakistanis and two midlevel afghan taliban officials said malem mashuq the district chief
it's not clear if the strike was linked to tuesday's shocking attack by the pakistan taliban on an army run school in peshawar northwestern pakistan in which one hundred and forty five people were killed one hundred and thirty two of them children
analysts say the afghan and pakistan taliban groups are closely affiliated often sharing resources and jointly plotting attacks on either side of the porous border
however a spokesman for the afghan taliban condemned the peshawar attack tuesday because it involved the deliberate killing of innocent people women and children
separately two bomb explosions wednesday morning in nangarhar's capital city jalalabad targeted afghan police vehicles killing two afghan policemen and injuring five others said zia abdulzai a spokesman for the provincial governor
the continuing violence comes as afghan security forces prepare to take on greater responsibility for ensuring the country's security as international forces transition to a supporting role
who are the pakistan taliban 

as pakistan started three days of national mourning wednesday the taliban said they targeted a school that mostly admits soldiers children because the students aspired to follow in their fathers footsteps and target militants
terrorists ambushed the school in peshawar on tuesday explosives strapped to their bodies and burst into an auditorium filled with students taking exams
they sprayed bullets rapidly killing one hundred and forty five people
of those one hundred and thirty two were children authorities said
in an email the terror group warned muslims to avoid places with military ties saying it attacked the school to avenge the deaths of children allegedly killed by soldiers in tribal areas
it accused the students at the army school of following the path of their fathers and brothers to take part in the fight against the tribesmen nationwide
the army public school and degree college is home to about one thousand one hundred students and staff most of them sons and daughters of army personnel from around peshawar
the public school admits children whose parents are in the military but its classes are not restricted to future soldiers
a day after the massacre pakistani prime minister nawaz sharif lifted a moratorium on the death penalty for terrorism cases
who are the pakistani taliban 
under the benches
kill them 
student ahmed faraz fourteen recalled the moment the terrorists struck
he was in the auditorium when about five people burst in through a back door and started firing
god is great the militants shouted as they roared through the hallways ahmed said
a lot of the children are under the benches a pakistan taliban member said according to ahmed
kill them 
the ninth grader got shot in his left shoulder and lay under a bench
my shoulder was peeking out of the bench ahmed recalled
they went into another room i ran to the exit i fell
seventh grader mohammad bilal said he was sitting outside his classroom taking a math test when the gunfire erupted
he fell into bushes before running to the school's gates to safety
students teachers recount the horror they saw
pakistani troops eventually pushed through the buildings room by room and confined the attackers to four buildings
they found children drenched in blood
some of the bodies lay on top of others
even the children are dying on the frontline in the war against terror said khawaja asif the defense minister
the smaller the coffin the heavier it is to carry
by the time the siege ended in the evening military officials said all seven militants were dead
it's unclear whether they were killed by soldiers or they detonated their explosives
the casualty tolls don't include the terrorists
the ambush at army public school and degree college left more than one hundred injured many with gunshot wounds according to mushtaq ghani a spokesman for khyber pakhtunkhwa province
the nightmare began in late morning when a car exploded behind the school
pakistani authorities said the blast was a ruse to divert security guards attention
gunmen got over the walls and walked through where students in grades eight nine and ten have classes
the militants came in with enough ammunition and other supplies to last for days and were not expecting to come out alive a pakistani military official said
most of those killed were between the ages of twelve and sixteen said pervez khattak chief minister of khyber pakhtunkhwa province of which peshawar is the capital
some adults were also targeted including a twenty eight year old office assistant who was shot and burned alive police official faisal shehzad said
pakistani authorities said the attackers goal was to kill not take captives
while lifting a moratorium on the death penalty in terror cases the prime minister expressed frustration about failed talks
we tried dialogue with these militants we reopened the door to talks sharif said
it was unsuccessful
there was no other option than to engage in an operation against these people
he did not mention any specific terror groups
but the pakistan taliban and the government have been involved in peace talks in the past
pakistan released nineteen taliban noncombatants in a goodwill gesture but talks broke down after a wave of militant attacks
pakistan has seen plenty of violence much of it involving militants targeting restive regions in northwest pakistan along the border with afghanistan
it is the home base of the pakistan taliban known as the tehreek e taliban pakistan or ttp which seeks to enforce its conservative version of islam in pakistan
the group has battled pakistani troops and attacked civilians including in peshawar an ancient city of more than three million people
and the taliban haven't hesitated to go after schoolchildren
their most notable target is malala yousafzai who was singled out and shot in october two thousand and twelve as she rode to school in a van with other girls
the teenage girl survived and became the youngest recipient of the nobel peace prize last week for her efforts to promote education and girls rights
yousafzai said the attack left her heartbroken
innocent children in their school have no place in horror such as this she said
this is the deadliest incident inside pakistan since october two thousand and seven when one hundred and thirty nine pakistanis died and more than two hundred and fifty others were wounded in an attack near a procession for exiled former pakistani prime minister benazir bhutto according to the university of maryland's global terrorism database
even the taliban in afghanistan who are closely affiliated with their pakistani counterparts criticized the killing of women and children as against islamic teaching
the spokesman for the afghan terror group expressed condolences to the victims of tuesday's attack

if travel industry experts are correct next year will see us snapping holiday braggies eating dinner at a local's house being served by a botler and more than likely heading to asia
singapore thailand and japan are among top destination picks for next year while world class sports events like the two thousand and fifteen rugby world cup will also see fans flocking to host nation england
why asia's hot right now
one of the hottest regions is asia and there are a couple of different drivers says elizabeth crabill president of global travel provider travelbound which serves forty thousand travel agents worldwide
japan notoriously expensive for foreign visitors is set to become more affordable because of the depreciation of the yen which has lost nearly a quarter of its value since two thousand and twelve
international currencies are going to go a lot farther says crabill
she points to increased interest in okinawa the hawaii of japan a string of islands in the south with a subtropical climate and a strong indigenous culture
thailand is expected to bounce back from a coup in may which hit tourism hard with unrest and curfews
there's a lot of pent up demand says crabill adding that in spite of the recent negative headlines tourists are likely to stream back to thailand for great food and glorious beaches
meanwhile singapore will celebrate its fifty th anniversary of independence in two thousand and fifteen making it a big draw for visitors
famed for its eclectic cuisine soaring skyscrapers and more recently ambitions to transform itself into a city in a garden starting with the one hundred hectare gardens by the bay singapore is putting on a number of events to celebrate its golden jubilee
highlights include the opening of the national gallery singapore and the opening of the jubilee walk which will cover historic locations on the island
it's our top destination for two thousand and fifteen globally says crabill

ten top destinations to visit in two thousand and fifteen
tech continues to drive the future of travel and it's shaping everything from the way we show off about our holidays with braggies like a selfie but taken within ten minutes of arriving at your hotel
it's also changing who brings us room service
technology is the strongest disruptive force in the travel industry today says angelo rossini travel and tourism analyst at euromonitor international
he's one of the editors of the annual wtm global trends report two thousand and fourteen released at last month's world travel market in london
one of the most surprising predictions in the report comes out of asia where millions of people now make travel bookings via instant messaging
chinese messaging service wechat has four hundred and forty million active users second only to u.s. messaging service whatsapp but it's leading the way when it comes to monetizing its popularity
chinese online travel agency ctrip sells air train and other tickets on wechat while travelers on low cost carrier spring airlines book flights and check in using its wechat service
instant messaging is becoming a threat to telecoms companies and also for social media says rossini
we definitely expect this to become the case in more and more other regions of the world
the report predicts that wearable tech will be an increasingly important tool for travelers over the next couple of years
products currently on sale include the sony smartwatch and google glass
but it's the apple watch which goes on sale in two thousand and fifteen that's expected to be the real game changer
starwood hotels which owns the sheraton st. regis w hotels and several other global brands is getting ahead of the trend with an apple watch and iphone app that allows hotel guests to unlock their hotel rooms without a key card
perhaps taking all this to its logical extreme aloft hotels also part of the starwood group is trialing a robot butler known as botler in cupertino california
botler brings you things you need for example toothpaste your slippers a newspaper says caroline bremner head of travel and tourism for euromonitor
cruise line royal caribbean installed robot bartenders on its new quantum of the seas which it says is the world's most technologically advanced cruise ship
however technicians had to pull to plug on them on the inaugural voyage after they failed to stand glasses upright and mix cocktails fast enough according to the daily telegraph
at some point the introduction of tech has to be functional not just novelty and there's a danger that hospitality goes toward gimmick says bremner
in two thousand and fifteen more of us will likely book our own holidays use online forums to research destinations and rent from locals when we get there
we are seeing more and more people move away from the model of getting a package holiday says james kay spokesperson for online booking and review company tripadvisor
the company announced in august two thousand and fourteen that three hundred and fifteen million people now use the site each month an increase of twenty percents from two thousand and thirteen
increasing numbers of people are using tripadvisor's forums to research destinations in advance taking the opportunity to ask locals specific questions
they will take time to put the pieces of a trip together because they figure they can get better value for money on it and also find those local gems kay adds
the sharing economy particularly peer to peer rentals and experiences is gaining popularity at warp speed
poster child of the movement holiday rentals site airbnb currently has six million guests in one hundred and ninety countries
some of that growth has come from word of mouth according to euromonitor's bremner
people might have been hesitant but then they hear of who have had a positive experience or not and they are more inclined to try it out she says
what we're all likely to be doing a lot more next year is eating with the locals not in restaurants but in their homes according to the wtm global trends report two thousand and fourteen
sites like eatwith dot com which pairs travelers with home cooks and bookalokal dot com a network of locals who offer meals and cooking classes are rapidly expanding
my best travel experiences have always involved having a local person on the ground so i set out to launch a platform where travelers could connect with local people says bookalokal dot com founder evelyne white in the report
both bookalokal dot com and eatwith dot com apply the airbnb model to dining
guests review hosts and some are verified for food quality venue and cleanliness
peer to peer sites that offer experiences like vayable dot com are also popping up
vayable connects travelers with locals offering everything from a night photography tour of paris to kayaking in auckland to a tour of kibera africa's largest slum
services like these are forecast to become some of the fastest growing areas in the travel industry over the next few years fueled by the public's appetite for authentic experiences and connections with local people

they almost wouldn't even let me bring the camera inside cristofoletti recalled
he was able to bring his camera inside however and when he saw a woman shopping in a colorful patterned headscarf he made a surreptitious click of the shutter
i was able to take that one without looking he said of an image he made for his series exploring western style consumerism in iran
a former advertising director in italy and spain cristofoletti left the profession behind four years ago and moved to cambodia to pursue photography
he founded ruom a collective of journalists who specialize in social reportage in southeast asia
last year cristofoletti got the opportunity to visit friends working as graphic designers in iran and he jumped on the chance to see what daily life is like there
i've always been interested in closed countries he said
i got this great opportunity to be there with locals
you are able to see things in a very different way
during cristofoletti's monthlong stay in iran he began to notice the differences in the way iranians live their public and private lives
he realized that daily life in iran contradicted the way iran is typically portrayed
the perception we have is not real he said
my idea was to try to see with my eyes what is the reality of iran
cristofoletti chose to show this new reality by documenting the increasing presence of western style consumerism in a country steeped in tradition
his photos juxtapose typical iranian markets with modern brightly lit shopping malls
even if traditional grand bazaars continue to be the favorite places to shop for regular iranians they now face competition from huge shopping malls which were erected in the outskirts of major cities across the country cristofoletti said
the malls feature supermarkets international brands and vibrant video game arcades as a kind of alternative entertainment
i was really surprised to see these kind of modern stores and malls he said
shopping has become a near obsessive ritual for young people
cristofoletti notes that for women especially some aspects of western culture are particularly alluring
he found that because iranian women are prohibited from showing any part of their body except for the face they have taken to buying high end beauty products and undergoing plastic surgery to make their features look more european or american
it is through these measures cristofoletti said that women are able to rebel against government imposed restrictions
cristofoletti was aware of certain constraints to life in iran and he consulted with a journalist there before his trip who advised him that it was safer to go as just a tourist rather than as a journalist
he said it could cause a problem for the person that is helping you cristofoletti said
consumerism was a feasible subject because it was right in front of him
it just popped into my mind when i started seeing it he said
it was a natural process
i spent a lot of time in the malls and just acted like a normal tourist
don't see you as a problem
cristofoletti wants his project to change the way people around the world think about iran
it's no different from our country he said
there is this will of the people to be free
they want to express themselves
you just need to find the right angle he added and see everything in perspective

the opinions expressed in this commentary are theirs
there can be life after death or at least in american politics as we have just seen with the u.s. senate's approval of dr. vivek murthy as the next u.s. surgeon general
it's a small political miracle that promises to serve the nation well over the next two years
when president barack obama first nominated dr. murthy thirteen months ago leading public heath officials heartily applauded
he was a fresh dynamic young doctor who had distinguished himself by figuring out better ways to serve low income patients in poor neighborhoods
but opposition quickly mounted outside the medical community
republicans had held up his candidacy on two grounds
they said that at age thirty seven he was too young and inexperienced for the post
more importantly they bowed to the national rifle association which fiercely opposed murthy because he had the temerity to say that guns are a public health issue
republicans were wrong on both counts
the point is that the nra remains an extraordinary force in our politics
as it whipped up opposition a good number of democratic senators especially those up for re election this past november soon buckled to the nra too
the white house continued to give murthy quiet support but ducked a public fight
murthy's nomination went into a tailspin and has seemed doomed since april
but then a strange thing happened by beginning debate on a point of order against obama's immigration executive order republican sen. ted cruz gave majority leader harry reid the opportunity to call a special session and put two dozen stalled obama nominees on the agenda for confirmation before the senate recessed
as a result murthy was confirmed monday afternoon as the nineteenth u.s
surgeon general monday afternoon by a fifty one forty three vote
some months ago one of us had a chance to sit down with murthy for a lengthy conversation about his background and his hopes as a possible surgeon general
we also explored his leadership capabilities with others in his generation
what emerged was a portrait of a doctor who not only has the quantity of experience necessary but also the quality of experience
he is a lifelong advocate for reductions in health disparities whose focus in the job will be on obesity smoking vaccinations and mental health pressing health concerns that often break down along racial and socioeconomic lines
not only will he be excellent at managing imminent public health crises but he also promises to be a solutions oriented data driven leader on some of this country's most intractable health problems
as dr. paul farmer a harvard university professor and founder of partners in health has said
dr. vivek murthy has long experience in community based care in communicating complex messages in a straightforward and even handed manner and is committed not just to passing on information to others but to learning from them too
it is also important to recognize that murthy has the resounding support of the medical community having been endorsed by the american academy of pediatrics the american medical association and the american cancer society
as we saw with the ebola crisis the nation needs a strong public health leader to step into a post that's been vacant too long
americans were and remain confused about quarantine requirements and how much risk ebola poses
people didn't understand why government officials were not mandating quarantines for everyone who had been in contact with ebola patients
this recent crisis highlights the need for a visible surgeon general who can educate the public during health emergencies
as opposed to the centers for disease control and prevention and the national institutes of health two agencies primarily concerned with academic research the role of the surgeon general is to be the leading spokesperson on matters of public health in the united states the country's doctor who can be trusted by rich and poor alike
the ebola crisis demanded a public health official capable of leading in crisis reassuring american families that they were safe and advocating for necessary precautions
the leadership vacuum is partly responsible for the government's initial bungling on ebola and demonstrates just how important murthy's confirmation is
if he goes down the post could be vacant for another year or perhaps even two
the root of the nra's opposition to murthy and the subsequent political maneuvering to stall his nomination stems from an october two thousand and twelve tweet in which he wrote guns are a health care issue
he was right guns are a public health issue
we once thought cigarettes were outside the purview of anything but the food and drug administration but soon realized that they were a huge health issue
guns are too particularly when over seven thousand young people under age twenty are admitted to u.s. hospitals every year because of firearm injuries about twenty a day
it is entirely reasonable for the nra to stand up for its beliefs in people's rights under the second amendment this country should always welcome robust debate about rights
but the gun lobby should not hold a veto power over what is best to protect the public health of our citizens
doctors are right to speak out after treating so many gun victims in emergency rooms across the country
primary care physicians are right to ask families if they have guns in their homes
a lot of young lives can be saved
it was especially fitting if the u.s. senate were to approve murthy on monday just a day after the second anniversary of the sandy hook elementary school shooting in newtown connecticut

carol costello anchors the nine a.m. to eleven a.m
et edition of cnn's newsroom each weekday
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author
would you rather be sexy or smart 
i hate that dumb question
of course you'd rather be smart
although just the other day debbie sterling a stanford engineering graduate and successful entrepreneur told me growing up as a little girl i was always very smart and i got good grades but i always wanted people to tell me that i was pretty
like to me that was the ultimate success
sexy sells
it can make you rich
and stunningly successful
it wasn't kim's brain that launched the kardashian empire
wait i hear you
kim is smart
she turned a sex tape into a hit reality tv show
she developed a cosmetics line
she tried to break the internet
but it's not like kim goes around urging little girls to use their brains
she is sending them a decidedly different kind of message
so again how would you answer sexy or smart 
eileen pollack who was one of the first women to earn a bachelor's degree in physics from yale is writing a book called the only woman in the room
why science is still a boy's club
it aims to expose factors that impact women's access to careers in science technology engineering and math the fields known collectively as stem
she had this to say
first of all that the question would even be asked i can see all the anxiety that it poses
why is that even a question 
why isn't it assumed that they can be both 
this isn't a critique of your question because that question is the story of my life
i can understand that
pollack as a yale physics pioneer isn't speaking to us from the grave but from the heart
why is it she wonders when girls reach the age of six brains take a back seat to beauty even if they have both 
if it's your professor or employer i guess you want to be smart pollack said
but not if there is a guy in the room
in america nobody's boyfriend wants them to be smarter than he is and no one wants to admit it
cue the tabloids
if kim kardashian really is smart then why is her husband music mogul kanye west now supposedly controlling her empire 
even if that's not true the narrative exists and it says something about how girls may in their heart of hearts answer that question
sterling and i talked about how to persuade more girls to skip the kim princess route and revel in their natural curiosity
it's why sterling created her toy company goldieblox
growing up as a little girl i certainly had no interest in becoming a scientist or mathematician or engineer sterling said
i thought it was a boys only club for geniuses
and i pictured this old white man in a lab coat with no friends
goldie the doll who rules the goldieblox world isn't beautiful like princess anna not sexy like barbie but brainy curious and quirky like sterling herself
and when i say quirky i don't mean like the brainy women on the big bang theory
i don't think many little girls clamor to be like amy or bernadette
sexy wins the day on that show
penny a community college dropout is incurious and kinda well dippy
but she is sexy
and she continually wins the sexy brilliant male nerd
leonard hofstadter
poor bernadette is stuck with howard a man penny once described as disgusting
and amy 
well
i bring up the big bang theory and lump it in with kim kardashian because both send a strong message to impressionable girls and to the rest of us
i'm not saying they are solely to blame for the wiki how site that instructs girls to be smart without being nerdy but something in our culture is causing girls to tune out math and science
in many countries girls now outperform boys in science but not in the united states according to a study by the organisation for economic cooperation and development reported by the new york times
sterling says that means it's a cultural issue in the united states rather than a gender one
just look at fabiola gianotti
she is a physicist from milan italy
gianotti was just elected to lead the most prestigious particle physics research center in the world cern
or as vanity fair describes it a nine billion dollar cathedral of science that could unlock the secrets of the universe
i grew up in environment that had more women in science gianotti told me
when i asked her the sexy smart question she sounded puzzled
i hope women and men in general value their brain
the brain is much more useful in life than beauty
interestingly gianotti sees physics in a decidedly feminine way
i like the beauty of physics she told me
nature is beautiful it is my second soul to music
when i asked her who inspired her gianotti did not hesitate
marie curie the nobel prize winning physicist who researched radioactivity is her idol
she had a domestic way of doing physics gianotti told me
she had a lab in her house
she could prepare dinner in her kitchen then move into her lab
she could have a normal life
really amazing
note gianotti said a normal life
that's important because american girls like normal
pollack points to a two thousand and ten american mathematical society study that determined why so few women in the united states became physicists mathematicians or computer scientists to prove the point
one reason and i stress only one is that girls are not attracted to the asocial geek image associated with the sciences
they find the culture unsatisfying
parents don't want their kids to be nerdy pollack told me
for women even if she's nerdy enough to be steve jobs she's undateable
see it all comes back to that not so easy question
there's still this americanized version of being too smart in anything pollack continued
you have to look like a porn star in eighth grade
there's this huge obsession with romance being a princess a supermom
maybe sterling's little goldie doll who actively maligns america's cultural definition of beauty in online videos can help
in goldie vs. the big sister machine a woman states
you are beauty and beauty is perfection
identically dressed little girls walk the runway as another little girl in sneakers blows that myth out of the water
as sterling puts it i was hoping that if girls looked at goldie and they wanted to be like her and do what she does they might value their brains as much as their beauty
so sexy or smart 
come on ask your daughter which is more important
then ask her why

editor's note
actress rooney mara is a global ambassador for oxfam an international relief and development organization and has made three trips to south sudan
the opinions expressed in this commentary are hers
when most people think of south sudan if they think of it at all they imagine poverty and war
they imagine a world and people that are far removed from the everyday life that most of us reading this are lucky enough to enjoy
but that was not my experience in the world's youngest nation
what i saw on my three trips through south sudan were people just like you and me
people with desires and needs
people in love
mothers and fathers
sisters and brothers
friends and enemies
people with resilience determination
but above all hope
a year ago monday conflict again erupted in south sudan
since then thousands of people have been killed nearly two million people have been forced to flee their homes and six million south sudanese almost half the country have found themselves in desperate need of aid
last week as i traveled through mingkaman a small village in south sudan's lakes state with the aid organization oxfam i met people whose lives have been turned upside down by conflict over the last year but who still haven't lost their belief that things can get better
at a camp for people who had crossed the nile to escape the violence that destroyed their homes a middle aged dinka man who was easily seven feet tall told me that armed men had stolen all of his cows his main source of income
when i offered my sympathy for his loss he smiled and said don't worry i will get more cows
indeed much of the story of south sudan is a story of hope
when the country gained independence in two thousand and eleven after more than half a century of war people danced and cried with joy in the streets as they looked forward to a future of peace and development
cnn photos
a nation on the brink of an abyss
through the valiant efforts of the south sudanese people and support from the international community and organizations like oxfam things were getting better
new roads were paved communities without access to clean water saw wells drilled and violence was drastically reduced
tens of thousands of young girls were receiving education for the first time
things were changing for the better
but then last december a power struggle between the country's president and vice president turned violent and led to a skirmish between some of their supporters that has wreaked havoc across the country
church leaders and civil society groups have appealed for peace and reconciliation
people i met are opposed to and terrified by what's happening
but as the summer's rains have ended and the roads are once again passable the fighting has resumed and is likely to get worse in the coming weeks
although the conflict has taken on an ethnic tone people i spoke with were at pains to tell me that this wasn't a conflict between the dinka and nuer tribes who have lived together worked together and intermarried for generations
standing in the midst of rows of newly planted tomatoes one dinka man took a break from weeding to tell me that he believed in a peaceful future for south sudan but not without greater action from the international community
when you have problems within your family he told me you sometimes can't solve it yourself
you need someone from outside to come in and help you reconcile
his words were echoed by so many south sudanese i spoke with who highlighted the special role of the united states in helping the country achieve peace and gain its independence and asked for america's assistance again now
as we mark one year since the start of this terrible conflict we have to do more to support south sudanese peacemakers and pressure the country's leaders to stop fighting
the resilience of the people of south sudan can only go so far without a political solution to this conflict
even now when i think of south sudan i don't think of war
i don't think of poverty and children with ak forty seven s. all of this exists within the country but i think of the confident cattle herder who believes he will regain his lost cows even in the face of such despair
i think of the many pregnant young women i met who were excited for their future and the future of their children hoping that it would include peace and a chance for a good education
but most of all i think about the many incredible people i met who have lost everything they have in the world but still manage to keep going and keep hoping for peace
it is for those people that the u.s. must act to keep that hope alive

we all know the feeling
you are going about your day making phone calls and texting when suddenly your smartphone's battery starts to look dangerously low
you don't have a charger with you and even if you did there would be nowhere to plug it in
for most people this means spending a few hours unconnected but not for residents of several towns and cities in serbia
they can charge their phones on the go thanks to strawberry tree the first of its kind public solar powered charging station installed in parks and squares across the country
conceived by milos milisavljevic in two thousand and eleven while he was still a student at belgrade university strawberry tree contains sixteen chargers for a variety of mobile phones and tablets as well as its own wi fi and usb sockets
his creation won the verge accelerate startup competition in san francisco at the end of october the only company from outside america to take part and already boasts the european union sustainable energy award
we rely heavily on our cell phones for many essential tasks during the day says milisavljevic now twenty six who founded his company strawberry energy when he received the first order for his charger
you communicate over your cell phone you are using maps taking photos so basically your phone becomes your life
it's a huge problem when you run out of battery because then you are just carrying a brick in your pocket he adds
strawberry tree named so after the symbolism of strawberries as the first fruit of the summer can work for up to twenty days without sunlight thanks to its in built solar batteries
it contains reused steel and ninety eight percents of it can be recycled
i was fascinated with clean technology and i wanted to find a way that it could benefit people in their everyday life by solving a common problem running out of battery says milisavljevic
while replenishing cell phone batteries is the device's main function milisavljevic wants strawberry tree to become a core item of infrastructure in what he calls a smart connected city of the future
each charger is equipped with sensors which measure conditions like air pollution noise levels and uv radiation in its vicinity
milisavljevic says he hopes these sensors could in the future enable people to access locally focused environmental data though an app on their smartphone
for example if you had a network of strawberry trees spread around the city you could check if there's ice on the road in your street what park is the quietest if you want to relax explains milisavljevic or if you have asthma or allergies you could see what's the air quality in the area you're planning to go to he adds
the company's ambitious plans don't stop there
after serbia was hit by devastating floods in may large swathes of the country lost power preventing many people from contacting their families for several days
milisavljevic thinks that his creation could become an invaluable resource in similar scenarios
strawberry tree could have an emergency button which would send a signal to emergency services that you are in danger and in any kind of a disaster for example if the power grid is down the tree would be the place where you could call for help and get in touch with your loved ones he adds
milisavljevic also stresses that in spite of the dramatic changes in the way that people communicate in the last fifty years cities have remained almost frozen in time
street signs are still street signs city lights are only city lights and benches are still just benches
there is hardly any innovation in city living so our dream is to bring new technology to outdoor public spaces so we can improve the quality of life in our cities he says

what is europe's best festival 
more from on the road serbia

if sport were a religion then the stadium would surely be its place of worship
inside these temples to physical feats language evokes the divine fearful fans pray for a miracle while losing prompts serious soul searching
so much so that architects these days must create more than a stage for human endurance
it's as if they have been asked to perform the architectural equivalent of feeding the five thousand with five loaves and two fish constructing an arena to elevate the senses capture the spirit of a community and become an icon for a city long after the last fan has passed through the turnstiles
it's like creating a contemporary cathedral in some ways said spela videcnik architect behind the sci fi spotty borisov arena home to the belarus national football team
often the stadium is meant to become the pride of a city a landmark object and as such a monument representing the latest achievements in architecture
since ancient greeks built the first olympic stadium in fine white marble the arena has been as much about inspiring awe as staging competition
today's architects must go even further
in an age where sporting events are captured on television in brilliant detail designers must lure us from the comfort of living rooms with multipurpose entertainment centers
no longer relegated to the outskirts of town these modern day social hubs are creeping inside our metropolises once more and they have more in common with historic cathedrals than you might think
look at the ancient greek and roman stadiums they're very much in the middle of the city said hubert nienhoff veteran german architect behind the redeveloped berlin olympic stadium and amazon arena at this year's world cup in brazil
but in the last fifty years the stadium became something that was not really integrated they were built outside the cities
they were for people who went there perhaps once a week for an event
while arenas like the colosseum in the heart of rome occupy real estate today's architects could only dream of we may soon see a return to centralized social spaces of old says nienhoff
now we're bringing in multiple uses for stadiums again like shops and conference halls he said
in the future they will not be outside the city but something like the cathedrals of the middle ages they will be a vital part of city life
a key part of this vision however will depend on improved transport infrastructure
in the future they will not be outside the city but something like the cathedrals of the middle ages they will be a vital part of city life there was a trend back in the one thousand nine hundred and eighty s of treating stadiums a bit like shopping centers
so you'd try and put them on the edges of cities said architect clive lewis designer behind the singapore national stadium and sports hub and winner at this year's world architecture festival award
but more and more it's important to make a stadium that's part of the city
they need to be integrated into the transport infrastructure so they're a naturally connected part of the city the event should start as soon as you leave your house
he goes one step further with a vision of one roof to house all of humanity
for me stadiums have taken over the function of a cathedral
it's a building that brings together people of all ages all cultures all religions
and the only other thing that comes close to that is an airport
at the heart of an arena both physically and spiritually is its playing area
and with the outcome of multimillion dollar matches riding on everything from grass quality to the position of the sun designers must get it pitch perfect
does that mean architects need to be sports fans themselves 
do we need to be religious to build a church 
we don't think so comes the reply from berger architects the company behind the brilliantly illuminated luanda multisports pavilion in angola
architects must be able to project themselves and think as if they were the final users of the space they're designing
do we need to be religious to build a church 
we don't think so and long after the grand final trophies have been handed out an arena must serve its people for decades to come
whether we're designing for the olympics or the world cup we're always actually thinking ahead to what we're going to do with the venue after that event said lewis whose singapore sports hub hopes to hold two hundred events every year
and i think there's a history in recent years of relatively few examples that have done that very well
perhaps the most striking example of this failure is athens
the greek capital may be the home of the modern olympics but over a century later its two thousand and four stadia has become a modern ruin of its own with venues overgrown with weeds walls covered in graffiti and seating rotted away
it's an eye watering death for an event which cost the country around eleven billion dollar to host
step inside today's stadiums and you'll find an entertainment juggernaut where fans are encouraged to dig deep into their pockets long before the first kick off
over the last fifty years corporate interests have changed stadiums more than anything else
years ago stadiums were just bare concrete and no seats just bleachers said lewis
today it's a lot more about the corporate experience the internal lounge corporate boxes restaurants
which means that people are coming to the venue an hour or two before the event and not leaving for an hour or two afterwards
over the last fifty years corporate interests have changed stadiums more than anything else the goal for stadium owners is to create an icon for the city one worthy of their name stamped across it in bright lights
the mayor asked us for something that would put durban on the map says nienhoff of the moses mabhiba stadium in durban built for the two thousand and ten south african world cup
if you looked at durban from the waterside there was nothing you could remember specifically from the skyline
that was before neinhoff's stark white arena was built on the coastline its swooping three hundred and fifty meter arched entrance and ruffled roof a sight to behold
but before nienhoff even puts pen to paper one of the first places he looks for inspiration is nature
with its reptilian faade the amazon arena built in manaus for the world up in brazil this year borrows much from the surrounding jungle
if you look into the structures of nature like a leaf or the skin of a snake there's always a logical system behind it explained nienhoff
manaus is in the middle of a rainforest so that's where we turned for inspiration
we're really trying to design something that's only meant for this one place
like nature itself these modern day temples of pleasure will also need to regenerate themselves in order to survive

superyachts of the future in your dreams 

once a year if you drive just several hours north of cape town into south africa's arid karoo semi desert you'll come across a tented town in the middle of a vast expanse of nothing like a surreal mirage
here huge sculptures punctuate the sky and the desert floor is dotted with art works from multi story creations to a field of tiny mushrooms that light up at night
thousands of people looking like extras from a hundred different movie sets wear elaborate costumes and body paint and wander around giving out hot dogs popcorn drinks ice creams and yoga lessons
there's a circus a post office a gingerbread house filled with sweets a swiss alpine chalet a saloon straight out of the wild west and nearly a hundred other themed camps including dance floors bars and coffee stations
this is afrikaburn africa's most unique unusual exhilarating and mind blowing festival
based on burning man which draws seventy thousand participants to nevada's black rock desert each year afrikaburn is not just a music or arts festival
the event held at the end of april is a chance to experience a different world where creativity self reliance self expression and communal effort are championed
other than ice there's nothing to buy and each participant has to bring everything they need to survive including shelter water and food
it's run on a gifting rather than bartering economy where each person is supposed to contribute something as a gift and all the entertainment and art is conceived of created and produced by the participants themselves
over the last three nights of the week long event the art works burn in mesmerizing fiery spectacles
when it's all over everything is packed up leaving no trace that this parallel universe ever existed
afrikaburn has been running for nine years increasing in size each year nine thousand people attended the two thousand and fourteen event
out of one hundred and thirty regional events scattered across the globe affiliated with burning man it's the largest
its worldwide fame is growing too each year more international participants travel to this remote corner of south africa just to attend the festival including americans many of whom declare that afrikaburn is how burning man was two decades ago before it became so big
for many participants attending afrikaburn is a life changing experience it's hard to come out of a week in the desert without looking at the world in a different way
one thing's for sure
it's definitely worth traveling to south africa for
here are twelve reasons why you should attend the next afrikaburn which takes place in april two thousand and fifteen
more
the coolest city in south africa you've never seen
the creativity and effort that goes into the art works of afrikaburn is simply astounding
some like subterrafuge made up of six timber cones rising up as high as one hundred feet a statement against fracking in the karoo have a political stance
others such as reflection a giant wooden construction of a man's torso arms and face rising out of the ground which became the backdrop of a laser and projection mapping show are just incredibly beautiful structures
smaller art works are also created to inspire a childlike sense of delight think a telephone booth where you can call god and a wigwam made of wigs
afrikaburn is run on eleven guiding principles which act like a manifesto and a kind of constitutional self governing law
one of these principles is participation everyone who attends afrikaburn is expected to get involved in some way
most people take part by dressing in elaborate costumes others run a bar or a dance floor others create art or help build something and around one thousand each year sign up as volunteers
by participating in afrikaburn everyone becomes part of the event and it's a lot more fun than just being a spectator
for many watching the spectacle of giant art works burning with a crowd of thousands gasping in awe in union is a major highlight of afrikaburn
there's something inherently primal about being close to a huge blaze and something deeply profound in the fiery destruction of art that took months to create
the burnings are beautiful and spectacular but on a deeper level they speak to ideas of transience and presence

it's extremely liberating to spend a week without taking out your wallet but what's even more amazing is experiencing the generosity of strangers at afrikaburn
the idea is that everyone gives out unconditional gifts it's heartwarming to receive unexpected treats
even more so to give out the gifts that you've brought
those attending afrikaburn get a taste of what it's like to survive in an inhospitable environment of heat cold wind and dust storms that leave a layer of sand over everything
they need to bring a tent cook food over a gas stove and ration water use
there are toilets but no showers and nowhere to buy water
going into survival mode is part of the fun of afrikaburn and it also means that when participants get back into civilization they'll hopefully learn to look at the simplest things like running water out of a tap with new found appreciation
set around a big circle known as the binnekring are over one hundred theme camps public spaces that all offer something different and form the key components of the festival
there are massage parlors chill spaces photo booths cocktail bars a general store post office and even a swimming pool
each year they're different so you never know what to expect
at night afrikaburn turns into one giant party as music blasts from dozens of small big and almost hidden dance floors
expect to hear an eclectic range of genres everything from hip hop and blues to trance and deep house and catch some of south africa's best djs playing sets
most people bring bicycles to afrikaburn to get around the event is spread over a large area
but the best methods of transportation are the many mutant vehicles or art cars that traverse the desert town with no set route or direction
visitors can jump onto the back of a big purple snail a porcupine or a rhino or sail across the horizon in a pirate ship
not many tourists venture into the northern cape south africa's largest and most sparsely populated province but they're missing out on the starkly beautiful desert landscapes of the karoo
afrikaburn is set on a farm alongside the tanka karoo national park an underrated reserve that's well worth a visit on the way back to cape town

with its huge horizons and cotton wool clouds the karoo has some of south africa's best sunsets each afternoon's sky becomes a painting of pink apricot and dusky purple an exquisite backdrop of art works punctuating the sky

at night the sky explodes into a thick blanket of stars for those who can tear themselves away from the dance floors there's some epic stargazing to be had

tickets are ninety five dollar
the first round of nine thousand eight hundred tickets goes on sale december nineteen two thousand and fourteen at ten zero gmt and the second round goes on sale on january thirty two thousand and fifteen at the same time

oslo norway at a prize ceremony honoring peace adn corts says violence and injustice sent him rushing toward the stage
in a matter of seconds the twenty one year old mexican student's face was seen around the world last week as he stood in front of malala yousafzai at the nobel peace prize ceremony in oslo norway
please malala mexico he repeated as he unfurled a mexican flag on the stage at oslo's city hall where the seventeen year old laureate was about to become the youngest person ever to receive the prestigious award
oslo police have come under fire over the incident with critics asking how someone who wasn't on the ceremony's guest list managed to slip through security checkpoints and make it to the front of the room standing just steps away from yousafzai and other dignitaries before security hauled him out of the auditorium
speaking to cnn at an oslo detention center on sunday corts said he knows it was a drastic move
but he felt like he had no choice and wanted only a few seconds to speak about mexico's problems on a global stage
my motivation was to show solidarity with all the things that have happened in my country ultimately well the forty three missing students who are suspected to be dead and burned that was my main motivation he said
i am tired of so many injustices that we have lived in mexico for decades
the students case has sparked national outrage in mexico and drawn global attention to the country's continued struggles to deal with police corruption and drug related violence
authorities have said the students from a rural teachers college were rounded up on the orders of a local mayor then delivered to the drug gang to be executed
mexico's attorney general says the students remains were burned at a landfill placed inside plastic bags and thrown into a river
but so far only one student's remains have been identified
corts said he was seeking asylum in norway but authorities there have informed him that he'll be sent back to mexico on monday corts and his attorney said
before learning that he was getting kicked out of norway he told cnn he was scared to return to his home country
i do not want to be one more student who disappears and who later turns up dead and the government later says that it was organized crime he said
corts told cnn he went through a security checkpoint with invited guests at last week's ceremony but no one asked him for identification or stopped him as he approached the stage
i was really nervous
i was saying this is my moment and this is my opportunity to speak out for all the people who i have seen suffer in mexico he said
oslo police said corts had been fined fifteen thousand kroner for nuisance and for entering the city hall illegally
even critics who question the appropriateness of disrupting the nobel ceremony would have done the same thing he said if they had a little bit of empathy toward what all the families of so many people who have been killed and disappeared in mexico have felt this desperation and this impotence to not have a way to express themselves and demand justice

two car bombs killed at least thirty one people including twenty children in central yemen's radaa city when suspected al qaeda fighters targeted houthi militants tuesday senior security officials and locals told cnn
one car bomb struck a houthi gathering point but the other did not make it to the target and instead blew up next to a bus that was carrying children home from school officials said
all the killed children were under the age of twelve said osama sari a prominent pro houthi activist
eleven houthi fighters were killed an interior ministry official said
eyewitnesses told cnn that the death toll within houthi lines exceeded eighteen
at least a dozen others were injured among them six in critical condition medical sources in radaa told cnn
radaa was an al qaeda stronghold that fell to houthi fighters after clashes in october that killed hundreds from both sides
al qaeda has since intensified its attacks on houthi targets conducting daily attacks killing hundreds of houthis and innocent civilians
houthis follow the zaidi sect of islam and are considered shiite muslims by al qaeda a sunni muslim terrorist network
sari said that most of the killed were children and that the attack holds the hallmarks of al qaeda
the suicide car bombs were supposed to directly hit the houthi camp
when they failed to reach the core target many innocent children lost their lives sari said

katrina dawson was having a monday morning coffee with a colleague at the cafe down the street from their law firm's office when the nightmare began
the thirty eight year old mother of three was among seventeen people taken hostage by a gun wielding man with extremist muslim views who seized control of the lindt chocolate cafe in the heart of sydney's central business district
the siege last around sixteen hours before police stormed the cafe in the middle of the night
the gunman was killed but so were dawson and another hostage tori johnson the manager of the cafe
after the two victims identities were revealed tuesday morning tributes began to pour in
these were decent good people who were going about their ordinary lives australian prime minister tony abbott said
it's about as innocent a thing as anyone can do to go and grab a cup of coffee before the working day has fully started
what we know what we don't know
we are so proud of our beautiful boy tori gone from this earth but forever in our memories as the most amazing life partner son and brother we could ever wish for johnson's family said in a statement
the thirty four year old had worked for lindt for more than two years the company said
he was a great ambassador for our company and the store that he managed which he cared about passionately said lindt chief executive stephen loane
he was a dedicated professional who always built a great rapport with his customers and was much loved by the lindt team
johnson was reportedly killed as he tried to wrestle the gun away from the hostage taker the australian broadcasting corporation reported citing unidentified sources
police haven't confirmed that account
he was an amazing person a selfless person a person who always put other people before himself said peter manettas johnson's former boss at the adria rybar and grill in sydney where he worked for several years before the lindt cafe
manettas told the daily telegraph that family was everything to him and not a single day would go by when he wouldn't talk about them

it takes sanduk ruit about five minutes to change someone's life
in that time the nepalese doctor can make a small incision in his patient's eye remove the cloudy cataract impairing her vision and replace it with an inexpensive artificial lens
some of our younger surgeons even do it faster than that ruit told cnn
for many patients it's the first time they've seen in years if not decades
in the past thirty years ruit has personally restored the sight of more than one hundred thousand people across asia and africa and taught his rapid fire technique to countless other eye surgeons in parts of the world as isolated as north korea
his patients suffer from eye conditions that are mostly preventable
but because of poverty and limited access to public health services they have been unable to seek treatment
their story is all too common in the developing world
an estimated thirty nine million people are blind worldwide according to the world health organization
of these around ninety percents live in low income areas and eighty percents suffer from conditions that can be prevented or cured
driven by a belief that the world's poorest people deserve safe affordable and high quality eye care just as much as anyone else ruit has made it his mission to eradicate avoidable blindness
in one thousand nine hundred and ninety four he joined the late australian ophthalmologist and philanthropist fred hollows who was his mentor and close friend in establishing tilganga an eye hospital in kathmandu dedicated to providing world class eye care to the people of nepal
the hospital manufactures state of the art lenses that are commonly used in treating cataracts or myopia and exports them to more than thirty countries worldwide
for those who can not reach urban areas ruit and his team conduct mobile eye camps in remote parts of nepal and neighboring countries often trekking for days and cleaning out structures like tents classrooms or even animal stables for use as temporary operating theaters
when the eye patches come off the day after an operation it's an incredibly moving moment for all involved
australian photographer michael amendolia has been capturing these intimate scenes the expressions of relief and tears of joy while traveling with ruit and his colleagues since the early one thousand nine hundred and ninety s
to mark the twenty th anniversary of tilganga amendolia has released some of his most striking images of ruit and his team at work in nepal and other countries in the region including bhutan china myanmar north korea and indonesia
amendolia who described ruit as a maverick in some ways accompanied the nepalese surgeon on one of the first trips to north korea in two thousand and six
the communist state is notoriously closed off to westerners
international aid workers frequently struggle to reach those most in need in a country where two thirds of the population experiences chronic food shortages according to the united nations
but ruit who believes in leaving politics to world leaders had persuaded the north korean authorities to allow his team to conduct the two thousand and six surgery and training session in the south eastern city of haeju after he had treated one of their diplomats stationed at the embassy in kathmandu
it was very restrictive said amendolia
we made the same path from the hotel in haeju the same way every day to the hospital the same way exactly back and that's all we saw of haeju for the seven or so days that we were there
amendolia describes how the north korean surgeons who came from across the country were so eager to learn that they huddled close to ruit leaning over the operating table to get a better look as he worked
i've never seen an eye operation where had so many surgeons around him he said
in the room where the recovering patients were examined portraits of then leader kim jong il and his predecessor kim il sung hung from the wall
one of the most moving images in amendolia's collection is that of an eighty year old north korean man who sees his son for the first time in ten years after being completely blind in both eyes
of course the man who's had the operation is so relieved because he can see again but the whole family suddenly have a family member who can participate again in everything that happens as home amendolia said
patients who are blind in both eyes require constant care placing a burden on their families that can keep them trapped in a cycle of poverty
but this quick healing surgery allows them to regain their independence
the same transformative moment is played out for long neglected patients in the mountains of nepal the islands of indonesia and rural china
ruit grew up in a small village in the himalayas so isolated that the nearest school was a week's walk away
when he was seventeen his sister died of tuberculosis despite the disease being treatable
the loss left ruit with a sense of urgency to pursue a path that benefited others not only himself
i am so grateful that i can make a difference in so many people's lives ruit said
at fifty nine that same sense of urgency that motivated him as a young man remains
when asked what it feels like to watch as a patient sees the world clearly the first time he responded
it really recharges you and makes you move forward
but he cautioned that there remains so much he wants to do

let's start with a touch of perspective
it's not only russia where sexual minorities suffer discrimination
in the united states that beacon of tolerance there's still a huge amount of bigotry
some u.s. states still refuse to recognize same sex marriage
and hate crimes and violence towards lgbt individuals remain a significant problem
russia does not have a monopoly on intolerance
however there is a key difference
in the u.s. officials go to great lengths to espouse tolerant views and behavior
laws have been passed and are enforced protecting lgbt rights
hate crimes are prosecuted
in russia that is rarely the case
that's not just my view it's the opinion of human rights watch a new york based rights group
in their latest report on russia titled license to harm hrw finds the russian authorities have not only failed in their obligation to prevent and prosecute homophobic violence but have also effectively legalized discrimination against lgbt people and cast them as second class citizens
the controversial measure the report singles out is of course russia's anti gay propaganda legislation
the law bans propaganda of non traditional sexual relations among minors and was according to hrw one of several anti lgbt measures adopted or proposed in two thousand and thirteen
in their report hrw says the law doesn't actually protect anyone but does give homophobes a reason to believe lgbt lives matter less to the russian government
the report goes on to document various horrific instances of violence and abuse against russia's lgbt community including by radical nationalist groups luring gay men on the pretext of a fake date
it makes grim reading
during the soviet union homosexuality was a crime punishable by prison and hard labor
homosexuals were regarded as pedophiles or fascists outside normal society
laws explicitly banning homosexuality were lifted in one thousand nine hundred and ninety three after the soviet collapse though there was no amnesty for those jailed for sodomy but the attitude appears to have stuck
even today lgbt activists in russia like the couple i met in st. petersburg recently are regarded as outsiders sometimes agents of the liberal west to be distrusted
the saint petersburg lawmaker behind the controversial propaganda law vitaly milonov underlined this when he told me that any russians who want a same sex marriage should move to the west where they belong
that's a potent connection in these times of growing tensions between russia and the west
linking russia's lgbt community with the enemy taps into old fears of corrupt outsiders polluting russian purity and bodes extremely badly for hopes that discrimination in russia will be tackled

god is great the taliban militants shouted as they roared through the hallways of a school in peshawar pakistan
then fourteen year old student ahmed faraz recalled one of them took a harsher tone
a lot of the children are under the benches a pakistani taliban said according to ahmed
kill them 
by the time the hours long siege at army public school and degree college ended early tuesday evening at least one hundred and forty five people one hundred and thirty two children ten school staff members and three soldiers were dead military spokesman gen. asim bajwa said
more than one hundred were injured many with gunshot wounds according to khyber pakhtunkhwa province information minister mushtaq ghani
the death toll does not include the terrorists who attacked the school bursting into an auditorium where a large number of students were taking an exam and gunning down many of them within minutes bajwa said
they started shooting indiscriminately bajwa said and that's where maximum damage was caused
pakistani taliban spokesman mohammed khurrassani said the militants scaled the school's walls around ten a.m. intent on killing older students there
the taliban had three hundred to four hundred people
under their custody at one point said khurrassani whose group is called tehreek e taliban pakistan or ttp
but bajwa said there was no hostage situation as the attackers focus was shooting to kill rather than taking captives
they were eventually met by pakistani troops who pushed through the complex building by building room by room
by four p.m. they'd confined the attackers to four buildings
a few hours later all the militants seven of them according to bajwa were dead
pakistani authorities spent tuesday night inside the school in peshawar a city about one hundred and twenty kilometers from the country's capital islamabad looking for survivors victims and improvised explosive devices planted to worsen the carnage
as they searched they discovered that the school's principal was among the terrorists victims
the attack drew sharp condemnation from top pakistani officials who vowed that the country wouldn't stop its war against the taliban
we are undeterred

we will not back off defense minister khawaja asif told cnn
but he said the ambush at the school is another example of how great his nation's sacrifices have been in fighting that's raged for more than a decade
even the children are dying on the frontline in the war against terror he said
the smaller the coffin the heavier it is to carry

it's a very very tragic day
what do the pakistan taliban want 
minister
most of the dead were twelve to sixteen years old
on a typical day the army public school and degree college is home to about one thousand one hundred students and staff most of them sons and daughters of army personnel from around peshawar though others attend as well
their nightmare began in late morning when a car exploded behind the school
pakistani education minister muhammad baligh ur rehman explained to cnn that the blast was a ruse meant to divert the attention of the school's security guards
gunmen got over the walls and walked through where students in grades eight nine and ten have classes and fired randomly said dr. aamir bilal of peshawar's lady reading hospital citing students
they came in with enough ammunition and other supplies to last for days and were not expecting to come out alive according to a pakistani military official
seventh grader mohammad bilal said he was sitting outside his classroom taking a math test when the gunfire erupted
he fell into bushes before running to the school's gates to safety
ahmed the fourteen year old student remembered being in the school's auditorium when four or five people burst in through a back door and started rapidly firing
after getting shot in his left shoulder the ninth grader lay under a bench
my shoulder was peeking out of the bench and somebody was following ahmed recalled
they went into another room i ran to the exit i fell
bajwa told reporters that pakistani security forces reached the school fifteen minutes after the attack began
they found he said the children
drenched in blood with their bodies on top of each other
most of those killed were between the ages of twelve and sixteen said pervez khattak chief minister of khyber pakhtunkhwa province of which peshawar is the capital
but some adults in the school also were targets like a twenty eight year old office assistant who was shot and then burned alive police official faisal shehzad said
pakistan has seen plenty of violence much of it involving militants based in provinces such as south waziristan north waziristan and the khyber agency all restive regions in northwest pakistan near peshawar along its border with afghanistan
it is the home base of the ttp an organization that has sought to force its conservative version of islam in pakistan
the group has battled pakistani troops and on a number of occasions attacked civilians as well
peshawar an ancient city of more than three million people tucked right up against the khyber pass has often found itself in the center of it all
militants repeatedly targeted the city in response to pakistani military offensives like a two thousand and nine truck bombing of a popular marketplace frequented by women and children that killed more than one hundred people
and the taliban hasn't hesitated to go after schoolchildren
their most notable target is malala yousafzai who was singled out and shot on october nine two thousand and twelve as she rode to school in a van with other girls
the teenage girl survived and last week became the youngest recipient of the nobel peace prize for her efforts to promote education and girls rights in pakistan and beyond
yousafzai was heartbroken by this senseless and cold blooded act of terror in peshawar saying tuesday that innocent children in their school have no place in horror such as this
i call upon the international community leaders in pakistan all political parties everyone stand up together and fight against terrorism the sixteen year old added in another statement
and we should make sure that every child gets a safe and quality education
still even by pakistan and the taliban's gruesome standards tuesday's attack may be the most abominable yet
this is the deadliest incident inside pakistan since october two thousand and seven when about one hundred and thirty nine pakistanis died and more than two hundred and fifty others were wounded in an attack near a procession for exiled former pakistani prime minister benazir bhutto according to the university of maryland's global terrorism database
even the taliban in afghanistan with which the ttp is closely affiliated criticized the deliberate killing of innocent people women and children against islamic principles and expressed condolences to the attack's victims according to spokesman zabiullah mujahid
it comes after peace talks between the pakistan taliban and pakistan's government as recently as last spring
the government released nineteen taliban noncombatants in a goodwill gesture in fact
but talks broke down under a wave of attacks by the taliban and mounting political pressure to bring the violence under control
in september two thousand and thirteen choir members and children attending sunday school were among eighty one people killed in a suicide bombing at the protestant all saints church of pakistan
a splinter group of the pakistan taliban claimed responsibility blaming the u.s. program of drone strikes in tribal areas of the country
and for the past few months the pakistani military has been conducting a ground offensive to clear out militants spurring violence that's displaced tens of thousands of people and sparked deadly retaliations
khurrassani the pakistan taliban spokesman told cnn that the latest attack was revenge for the killing of hundreds of innocent tribesmen during repeated army operations in provinces including south waziristan north waziristan and the khyber agency
the ttp spokesman challenged that ordinary citizens were targeted saying that five army vehicles are routinely stationed at the school
we are facing such heavy nights in routine khurrassani said rationalizing the siege shortly before it ended
today you must face the heavy night

the cafe siege in the heart of sydney ended early tuesday with the death of the gunman and two of his hostages but a great deal of unanswered questions remain
this has been an absolutely appalling and ugly incident australian prime minister tony abbott said noting that sydney had been touched by terrorism for the first time in more than thirty five years
details have emerged about the two hostages who died amid the siege's chaotic final moments and about the man who held them and others captive
but with police still investigating what happened during the sixteen long hours of the hostage taking here's a summary of what we know and don't know about key aspects of the story
what we know
authorities have identified the two hostages who were killed
katrina dawson thirty eight and tori johnson thirty four
a growing number of tributes are being paid to dawson a lawyer and johnson the manager of the cafe
dawson a mother of three worked down the street from the cafe
johnson had been employed by lindt for more than two years
what we don't know
how exactly they died
unconfirmed reports in australia media suggest both dawson and johnson may have been killed trying to protect others
the australian broadcasting corporation reported that johnson was trying to wrestle the gun from the hostage taker
the courier mail reported that dawson was trying to defend a pregnant colleague
police have declined to comment on the reports saying what happened is still under investigation
what we know
the hostage taker has been named as man haron monis a fifty year old man who was born in iran and settled in australia
australian prime minister tony abbott described monis as a deeply disturbed individual a long history of crime a long history of mental instability and infatuation with extremism
he pleaded guilty last year to writing offensive letters to the families of australian troops
he was also facing charges of being an accessory to murder as well as over forty five sexual and assault related offenses according to authorities
what we don't know
why he wasn't being more closely monitored 
abbott summed up the questions on many people's minds tuesday when he asked at a news conference how can someone who has had such a long and checkered history not be on the appropriate watch lists and how can someone like that be entirely at large in the community 
he said australian authorities would be looking at those questions in the days and weeks ahead
what we know
during the siege abbott said the hostage taker sought to cloak his actions with the symbolism of the death cult referring to the terrorist group that has seized control of large areas of iraq and syria
according to his website and social media posts monis styled himself as a muslim cleric espousing extremist views
after he settled in australia monis became sympathetic to what he perceived
was the victimization of muslims and islamists around the world his former lawyer manny conditsis told cnn
but his bigger cause according to conditsis was lobbying the australian government against sending troops to fight in wars on foreign soil like afghanistan where monis said innocent women and children were being killed
monis was intensely conflicted and contradicted and inconsistent conditsis said
what we don't know
what monis was trying to achieve by taking hostages in the cafe
the full picture is yet to emerge of what demands he made of authorities
australian media reported monday that he requested an isis flag and a phone call with abbott
conditsis said that when he represented monis last year he never ever spoke of physical violence of any kind
he suggested that something might have happened in the intervening months that caused him to become unhinged
monis last tweet linked to his website with a message posted the day of his attack on the sydney cafe
if we stay silent towards the criminals we can not have a peaceful society
the more you fight with crime the more peaceful you are
what we know
after around sixteen hours of the agonizing standoff police moved in after hearing gunfire inside the cafe according new south wales police commissioner andrew p. scipione
the courier mail reported that a technical support sniper positioned on the second floor of a building opposite the store made the call hostage down
window two that changed the course of events
police say they believe monis was acting alone
besides the two people who were killed four others were wounded by gunshots and two pregnant women were being assessed for health and welfare police said
all of them were reported to be in stable condition
what we don't know
what exactly happened inside the cafe
while reports of what took place are emerging in the australian media authorities are staying tight lipped as investigations continue
we're clearly speaking to those victims and we're clearly speaking to other witnesses
but this is going to take a bit of time to piece this together because a lot of those people are quite traumatized said new south wales deputy police commissioner catherine burn
what we know
australian leaders have applauded the reaction of their citizens pointing to the large numbers of flowers being laid at the scene of the siege in tribute to the victims
people have gone about their business and in the aftermath of the end of the siege last night people have responded with typical australian decency and generosity abbott said
muslim leaders in australia quickly condemned the hostage taking as a criminal act that has no place in islam
amid fears that australian muslims could become the targets of retaliatory attacks twitter users offered to accompany muslims wearing religious clothes on public transport as a gesture of solidarity
the social media campaign took off with the hashtag illridewithyou becoming the top trending hashtag globally in a few hours
meanwhile the new south wales police announced tuesday that it was launching a three week operation across sydney focused on high visibility policing increased presence in public places and public transport hubs
what we don't know
what the future holds
the cafe siege has raised troubling questions about the possibility of more so called lone wolf attacks
the tragedy of these times is that there are people even in a society such as ours who wish to do us harm abbott said
we are not immune to the politically motivated violence which has for so long stalked other countries
in recent months australia introduced some of the toughest anti terrorism laws in the world and raised the national terrorism alert level
but abbott said that authorities can only do so much to prevent attacks without prior warning and knowledge
even if this individual this sick and disturbed individual had been front and centre on our watch lists even if this individual had been monitored twenty four hours a day it's quite likely certainly possible that this incident could have taken place because the level of control that would be necessary to prevent people from going about their daily life would be very very high indeed the prime minister said

a top united nations official on monday told the security council she has run out of words to describe the worsening situation in syria
every time we use a new figure in relation to the syrian crisis we say that it is unprecedented
we have run out of words to fully explain the brutality violence and callous disregard for human life which is a hallmark of this crisis valerie amos the u.n. chief for humanitarian affairs said
nearly two hundred thousand people have been killed in the three year syrian conflict and one million injured amos said describing a war zone with three combative parties fighting each other with no regard for the thousands of civilians and children caught in the middle
the syrian government has used barrel bombs in densely populated areas and arbitrarily detained citizens and subjected them to serious beatings and torture
armed opposition groups have taken locals hostage and killed civilians by using explosive mortar and car bombs
isis has committed mass victimization of civilians including murder enslavement rape displacement and torture amos said
all parties involved in the conflict continue to violate the most basic of laws with devastating consequences she said
the under secretary general described a particularly horrible situation for the country's children
reports of children being publicly executed crucified beheaded and stoned to death particularly by isis has increased in recent months
other children sometimes as young as five years old are being trained at military camps amos said
this conflict is not only shattering syria's present it is also destroying its future she added
locations traditionally identified as safe havens in conflict areas such as hospitals schools and u.n. relief vehicles have not been exempt from attacks
seventy medical facilities across the country have been attacked over the last nine months sixty by government forces amos said citing statistics from physicians for human rights
one hundred and fifty medical personnel including ninety seven in the line of duty were killed over the same time period
while opposition groups have blocked medical supplies from entering besieged cities the government continues to withdraw medicines medical equipment and supplies including for surgical intervention such as antibiotics and injectable medicines from u.n. convoys she said
no one allowed out
no aid allowed in
for years amos said before describing a new tactic in one besieged town
tiny amounts of aid allowed in giving people hope but so little it can only help a fraction of those in need
people's hopes raised and then dashed
time and time again
the u.n. has identified air bombs car bombs or mortar attacks on or near schools at least thirty five times since february resulting in the death of at least one hundred and five children amos said
amos urged the security council members to ensure all parties in syria follow what they have outlined in resolutions
end indiscriminate use of weapons protect children from violations lift sieges on city and allow unhindered humanitarian assistance
even in war there are rules she said

the korean air executive who delayed a flight over a bag of macadamia nuts may face legal action after south korea's transportation ministry said on tuesday it had filed a complaint to prosecutors
heather cho who resigned from her post last week may be in violation of aviation safety laws the ministry said after she ordered the seoul bound plane to turn back to the gate and that a flight attendant be removed all because she was served nuts in a bag instead of on a plate in first class
testimonies of crew members and passengers confirm that cho used violent language in a loud voice which may not be compliant with an aviation safety law that requires cooperation of passengers on a flight the ministry of land infrastructure and transport said in a press release
although her role put her in charge of in flight service she was only a passenger on the flight and was not flying in an official capacity
cho whose korean name is cho hyun ah will report to the prosecutor's office on wednesday as part of an ongoing investigation
the airline also faces possible disciplinary action from the government because of the captain's failure to command and supervise crew members to ensure the safe operation of the flight said the ministry
cho resigned last week from the airline's catering and in flight sales business and from its cabin service and hotel business divisions korean air said
but the forty year old kept her title as a vice president of the national carrier according to company spokesman
the company chairman cho yang ho who is also her father publicly apologized for the incident saying that she will resign from the vice president job and positions held in affiliate companies
the incident which took place last week at new york's jfk airport stirred anger among the south korean public
she was one of the passengers not the vice president of korean air at that moment
i'm not sure what she was thinking but it's likely she was bossy and acted above her position baek ki jong a south korean resident told cnn
it was an abuse of power and a wrong action to take he said
angered internet users have condemned cho for bringing about international embarrassment and shame to the country
they are calling for korean air to change its name to hanjin airlines in a petition on agora a popular korean online discussion forum
korean air is owned by south korea's large family owned corporations known as hanjin
hanjin group's korean air is no longer a national company
they should not use korea in the name
as a citizen of korea i can not allow the word korea to be used commented acorn one user on the site
despite the public outrage the scandal has triggered an unexpected boon for some of korea's online retailers
sales for macadamia nuts have surged twenty fold over the past week on gmarket korea's most popular online shopping site which is owned by ebay said lee a company spokesperson who declined to give his full name
the round white nuts have become the top two best sellers on another korean online retailer coupang
one brand mauna loa sold out earlier but is now back in stock
some coupang users left comments on the site demanded that the nuts they ordered to be shipped and delivered on a plate and not in a bag

russian authorities are failing to protect gay people from persecution and are not prosecuting the perpetrators of a growing number of homophobic attacks human rights watch says in a new report
its report calls for a july two thousand and thirteen anti gay propaganda law to be repealed saying many lesbian gay bisexual and transgender people interviewed for the report had noticed an increase in persecution since last year
the two thousand and thirteen legislation bans propaganda of non traditional sexual relations around minors
this means the public discussion of gay rights and relationships anywhere children might hear it is prohibited
russian and international rights groups have condemned it as highly discriminatory
many of the lgbt interviewees for the report released monday reported increased stigma harassment and violence against them since two thousand and thirteen the rights group says
the law effectively legalized discrimination against lgbt people and cast them as second class citizens it says
instead of publicly denouncing anti lgbt violence and rhetoric russia's leadership has remained silent
in some cases public officials have engaged in explicit anti lgbt hate speech
the report says that twenty two of the seventy eight victims of homophobic and transphobic violence and harassment did not report attacks to police as they did not think they would be taken seriously
law enforcement bodies can prosecute such violence under russia's hate crime laws human rights watch says but not one of the cases documented in the report was investigated as a hate crime
the rights group describes anti lgbt groups made up of radical nationalist men luring gay men and children on fake dates before holding them against their will and humiliating them
in other cases lgbt people described being physically attacked by strangers on the subway on the street at nightclubs and in one case at a job interview its report says
a transgender woman referred to in the report as risa r is quoted as saying she was abducted and brutally assaulted in st. petersburg in two thousand and thirteen
they kept calling me a faggot and telling me how much they hated gays
i told them repeatedly that i wasn't gay that i was a transgender woman but they did not want to listen she says
one of them said you're nothing but a faggot
we will get your brain straight right now 
several times they threatened to rape me
then they took pliers from their car and ripped out two of my toenails
afterwards they said now you will be better off
now you will be pretty 
human rights watch says risa explained that she had not gone to police because she had no illusions that the police would investigate
it quotes an lgbt activist from pervouralsk gleb latnik as saying he had reported to police soon after he had been attacked
his injuries were visible there was significant bruising on his forehead there were bruises under his eyes and one eye was swollen shut the report says
the police officer who took his complaint said to him it's all right you're gay so it's normal that you were attacked
why would you need to file a complaint against anyone 
violence experienced by lgbt people in russia is unmistakably motivated by homophobia but the authorities deliberately ignore that these are hate crimes and fail to protect victims human rights watch's tanya cooper said
the report includes responses from the russian prosecutor general's office and russian interior ministry and the rights group said neither agency collected statistical data about attacks specifically committed against lgbt people
this month president vladimir putin met with russian human rights groups telling them that russia's priority was a healthy traditional family and a healthy nation
he said that did not mean that it would persecute those of a nontraditional orientation
people have tried to stick this label on us even people who use criminal law to persecute people of nontraditional orientation
some u.s. states make it a crime and though as far as i know these laws are not actually applied and the supreme court has suspended them but they are nevertheless still on the books
we have no criminal penalties he said
putin said that no one should face discrimination in russia
all people here have political rights social rights rights to employment and no one should face discrimination he said
but our strategic choice is for traditional families healthy families and a healthy nation
one does not exclude the other and does not hinder the other
i think this is a balanced approach and is entirely the right approach


a quran teacher in central somalia was the fifth beheading victim in one week at the hands of al shabaab the al qaeda linked militant group based in somalia
the quran teacher was snatched from his house in qandho by al shabaab militants on friday and they dumped his headless beheaded body near his home town on saturday morning local town spokesman abdiaziz durow told cnn
the teacher was identified as mohamed hussein forty five a resident of the qandho near the besieged town of bulo burde two hundred and seventeen miles north of mogadishu in central somalia
the reason the quran teacher was murdered is that he was one of the few residents that refused orders from al shabaab to leave his village that was recently seized by somali and au troops durow said
al shabaab had warned local residents to leave their houses in the towns they have seized according to durow
last week the militant group abducted and beheaded two somali policewomen in the city of teyeglow located in the southwest region
the beheadings prompted a government soldier whose wife was among the victims to kill five al shabaab wives in retaliation
al shabaab also beheaded two government soldiers near the town of bur hakaba in the bay region in south somalia
al shabaab is a somali group that was designated as a foreign terrorist organization by the u.s. government in march two thousand and eight
it is seeking to turn somalia into a fundamentalist islamic state
the group is believed to be responsible for attacks in somalia that have killed international aid workers journalists civilian leaders and african union peacekeepers

the death toll from a landslide that struck a village in central java friday burying dozens of homes has risen to thirty nine indonesian authorities say
days of heavy rains triggered a rush of mud rocks and trees from the mountains overlooking java's banjarnegara district on friday evening
sixty nine people remain unaccounted for the country's disaster management agency said
the landslide buried at least one hundred and five houses in and near sampang village the antara state news agency reported
at least fifteen people were injured by the landslide eleven of them seriously and close to six hundred people have been evacuated
video from local television showed muddy water still rushing along paths of the landslide saturday
a wall of newly fallen earth at least fifteen feet tall judging by the men standing at the base blocked a paved road
elsewhere people tried to gather belongings from a wooden house that had been torn open by the debris
still more footage showed dozens of people some crying gathered friday night at a hospital where injured had been taken
the military local red cross officials police volunteers and the national search and rescue agency joined in a rescue mission in the affected area the disaster management agency said
but it was later suspended due to pouring rain
friday's landslide came a day after two other slides killed two people in or near banjarnegara district antara reported
one of thursday's slides in banjarnegara's wanayasa area displaced more than three hundred and fifty people according to the state news outlet
landslides and flash floods are seasonal occurrences in the southeast asian archipelago where mountainous terrain and heavy rains make for prime slide conditions
satellite data appears to show parts of central java have received about two hundred millimeters of rain so far this month
that would be roughly the amount that the area gets on average the entire month of december
more showers are expected in the area in coming days
it wasn't clear exactly how much rain fell friday in banjarnegara district
but about ninety five kilometers to the southwest some one hundred and eight millimeters of rainfall was reported in the java port city of cilicap on friday

forget about william and catherine
the real star of this family is prince george as this year's release of the royals official christmas photographs proves
the three images taken outside with the young prince sitting on a flight of stone steps show the third in line to the throne looking relaxed and sporting a quizzical look and a cheeky grin
over a long sleeve white shirt he wears a knitted navy sweater vest featuring the iconic guardsmen seen outside buckingham palace home to his great grandmother queen elizabeth ii
the pictures taken in late november show prince george in a courtyard at kensington palace where his parents have their official residence in an apartment recently refurbished at a cost of millions of dollars
george is in shorts rather than long pants with knee high socks and shoes
it's a look some may love and others dismiss as rather twee
one of the reasons william and catherine released the pictures was in acknowledgment of the fact that their request for prince george to grow up without intrusion from photography has been and continues to be honored kensington palace said
his parents seized the limelight last week on a three day trip to new york city where they met with celebrities business leaders and political leaders as well as wowing crowds of onlookers
in the course of the whirlwind tour the duke and duchess of cambridge visited the nine eleven memorial and museum chatted with hillary and chelsea clinton at a royal foundation reception and even met jay z beyonce and king james also known as basketball star lebron james at an nba game between the brooklyn nets and james cleveland cavaliers
young george was left at home on this occasion having accompanied his parents on a spring trip to australia and new zealand
but these cute photos should restore the seventeen month old to center stage
catherine is due to give birth to the couple's second child in april next year

there are no known northern white rhinos left in the wild
northern white rhinos and southern white rhinos are different subspecies genetically
last year the international union for conservation of nature declared the northern white rhino as teetering on the brink of extinction
rhinos are killed by poachers almost exclusively for their horns which sell for tens of thousands of dollars
experts say that rhino horn is becoming more lucrative than drugs
the demand is driven primarily by buyers in east asia who believe it cures a series of ailments
organized crime syndicates are using military grade helicopters night vision equipment and guns fitted with silencers taking rhino poaching to a whole new level and leaving conservationists struggling to keep up

past a field of tilled soil and over a stone wall in a little brick house the children have been put to bed and there is a kettle on the stove
a woman speaks in a hushed voice on the phone
her voice is tired but full of emotion
another woman rises with the dawn and slips a scarf over her hair as she steps into the dew of a new morning
she ushers the livestock with a rough wooden stick to the point of gathering from there the village shepherd will take the animals out to pasture
still another woman with aged hands and a furrowed brow is bent low over a pile of potatoes
she peels them tirelessly as she prepares food for her family
in the armenian village of lichk you will find many hard working women but you will not find many men
all these women's husbands are thousands of miles away
because of the poor economic situation of this village ninety percents of its working age men have left for better paying construction jobs in russia
so for eight or nine months a year women run the village
these are sturdy women
a grit and strength sustain them as they bravely take care of not only their families but also their village as a whole
photographer julien pebrel had been working in the caucasus region when he heard rumors of towns without men
he and his translator did some investigating and found the stories were true
he spent two weeks in september two thousand and thirteen documenting the lives of the women of lichk
pebrel stayed with anoush and ruzanna two sisters in law who lived together with their families while their husbands worked in russia
he captured painterly scenes of the village with his rolleiflex film camera only using his digital camera in low lighting situations
that's why i love film he said
you don't need to do post production to get some beautiful colors
and indeed he has captured the feeling of a bygone era
the colors and lighting give the images a storybook quality
there is a great sense of community among the women
everything is a team effort from working the land uprooting vegetables herding the livestock across dirt roads sheering curly haired sheep baking flat bread and raising wide eyed little ones
now this is not to say that there are no men whatsoever in lichk
look under the shade of a cool brick wall and you can find the older generation wearing caps and denim as they tell stories and play cards on splintery wooden tables
these men serve as a source of authority over unruly schoolboys and provide support for their daughters in law
but even pebrel says it is still the women who do everything
in the beginning anoush and ruzanna didn't discuss the emotional toll this separation takes on them
but by the end they acknowledged that while most of the women in the town do trust their husbands there is still an underlying fear that the men may lead a secret life in russia
worse yet is that some of the men never return
we try not to think too much about that the women told him
while there is a great deal of determined patience required for both the husbands and wives the winter months are a time of pure celebration
when the men return at the end of the year the village is filled with weddings parties and births
it's a time of joyful reuniting
those three months together are savored before the husbands sons and fathers will pack their suitcases and leave for the majority of another year
again the women will unwaveringly take the helm of this village
despite the fiscal hardships the exhausting manual labor and the lonely pangs they face they remain strong and full of love

the deadly siege of a central sydney cafe has ended but the investigation is just beginning
australian authorities stormed the cafe where a self styled muslim cleric had been holding hostages early tuesday killing the gunman
they moved in some sixteen hours after the siege began after hearing gunfire inside the lindt chocolate cafe new south wales police commissioner andrew p. scipione told reporters
two of the seventeen hostages initially held by the gunman died according to scipione
they were later identified as katrina dawson thirty eight and tori johnson thirty four
other people were injured including a police officer who suffered a wound to the face from gunshot pellets
all were described by police to be in stable condition
understandably there is a lot of speculation but it will take time to clarify exactly what happened
and why australian prime minister tony abbott told reporters tuesday
what did the gunman want 
why did he choose the cafe as his target 
there is nothing more australian than dropping in at the local cafe for a morning coffee and it's tragic beyond words that people going about their everyday business should have been caught up in such a horrific incident abbott said
he offered his condolences to people caught in the attack and to their loved ones
these events do demonstrate that even a country as free as open as generous and as safe as ours is vulnerable to acts of politically motivated violence the prime minister said
but they also remind us that australia and australians are resilient and we are ready to respond
the gunman was identified as man haron monis by an official with direct knowledge of the situation
according to his social media posts the hostage taker appears to have embraced a radical sunni theology
abbott told reporters that the gunman was already well known to authorities and that he had a long history of violent crime infatuation with extremism and mental instability
before the raid monis had demanded a flag and phone call with abbott cnn affiliate sky news australia reported
he made the demands through hostages who contacted media organizations sky news reported
some hostages had also reportedly posted messages to social networking sites and the youtube online video service
police urged media early tuesday not to show the videos
monis also known as sheikh haron pleaded guilty in two thousand and thirteen to writing letters to relatives of australian service members saying they were hitler's soldiers according to australian media reports
he was believed to be acting alone and he didn't appear to be part of a broader plot additional u.s. law enforcement and intelligence sources said
the scene in sydney
grenades and gunfire
hundreds of police officers including snipers surrounded the cafe in sydney's central business district shortly after the gunman took over the building at ten a.m. monday
chilling images from australian media showed people believed to be hostages with their hands pressed against the cafe's windows
they were holding up a black flag with arabic writing on it reading there is no god but god and mohammed is the prophet of god
five hostages sprinted out of the cafe toward heavily armed police officers several hours into the standoff sending the gunman into a tirade according to an australian reporter
chris reason a correspondent for cnn affiliate seven network said the gunman became extremely agitated when he realized what had happened and started screaming orders at the remaining hostages
reason said he could see the gunman pacing past the cafe's windows from his vantage point at the network's nearby offices
he described the man as unshaven wearing a white shirt and black cap and carrying a shotgun
as night fell lights went out in the cafe reason reported
after a tense night police could be seen early tuesday throwing flash bang grenades into the cafe in video aired by seven network
gunfire erupted amid the chaos
a national security source in the united states said that a team of australian special forces troops and police had entered the lindt chocolate cafe from two directions and killed the gunman
video captured medics working on some people and others being carried away on stretchers
on tuesday the hostages who died were identified as dawson and johnson
katrina was one of our best and brightest barristers who will be greatly missed by her colleagues and friends at the nsw bar the new south wales bar association said in a statement
she was a devoted mother of three children and a valued member of her floor and of our bar community
our thoughts are with her family at this time
johnson's family also released a statement
it read in part
we are so proud of our beautiful boy tori gone from this earth but forever in our memories as the most amazing life partner son and brother we could ever wish for

now hot watergate has forced a china bound thai airasia flight to return to bangkok angering not just the passengers on board but also the chinese government and public
shortly after flight fd nine thousand one hundred and one took off last thursday evening from bangkok for the eastern chinese city of nanjing a male passenger asked a flight attendant for boiling water for his girlfriend's instant noodles witnesses told china's state media
when told they had to wait for the plane to reach cruising altitude the young man reportedly dumped food on the aisle stomped on it and yelled at other passengers who tried to calm him down
he was allegedly still fuming as a flight attendant of the budget airline brought a cup of hot water and charged him sixty thai baht for it
another argument ensued when he demanded chinese currency for change as well as an official receipt state media reported
as the quarrel dragged on the man's girlfriend threw hot water on the back of a flight attendant witnesses said
when the purser demanded the woman apologize the boyfriend exploded
in a cell phone video taken by a fellow passenger and posted online a man in a gray t shirt and jeans can be heard shouting in mandarin
you don't think i have money 
you caused all the problems and i'm going to blow up the plane
when the couple realized the flight was being turned back the woman reportedly grew hysterical hitting windows and threatening to jump off the plane according to state media
the plane carrying one hundred and seventy four passengers and six crew members hadn't even left thai airspace before it turned around
the captain of the flight decided to return the plane to don mueang airport bangkok's secondary airport deeming her actions as endangering to other passengers and impeding in flight service the airline said in a statement
thai authorities reportedly questioned the couple along with two of their friends who were also involved in the incident and ordered them to pay the flight attendant fifty thousand baht
the woman was also fined two hundred baht and the other three passengers one hundred baht each for disturbing public order
as news of hot watergate spread online many chinese internet users lamented that the airline didn't press criminal charges calling the fines imposed by thai officials a slap on the wrist for such shameful behavior

the most annoying type of airline passenger is
air rage on the rise in china
in recent years state media has reported numerous dramatic incidents involving irate passengers ranging from blocking moving aircraft on an active runway to fistfights with airport employees
with the exponential growth of outbound tourism chinese fliers now seem to be exporting their rage overseas
in february two thousand and twelve a chinese couple was kicked off their united flight from guam to shanghai after they repeatedly yelled at a flight attendant and told her to shut up when she tried to move their luggage in the overhead bin to accommodate other passengers
in september that year a swiss flight bound for beijing was forced to return to zurich when a fight broke out between two chinese men over a reclined seat
in february this year a fight erupted between two groups of chinese passengers before their flight could take off from the thai resort island of phuket resulting in twenty nine people being taken off the plane
then in april a thai airways red eye from bangkok to beijing turned bloody when a brawl involving three chinese men broke out
during an official visit to the maldives in september president xi jinping personally asked chinese tourists to behave themselves while traveling abroad
last year the government released a lengthy list of do's and don'ts aimed at turning chinese travelers into civilized tourists
after the latest incident the national tourism administration said in a statement that actions of the four passengers had severely damaged the overall image of chinese people and demanded local authorities to review the case
all the warnings and cajoling seem to have fallen on deaf ears though
when they arrived in nanjing on the same thai airasia flight the following day the four passengers refused to disembark state media quoted a witness as saying
they demanded a written statement from the airline that would exonerate them from having caused the incident thursday delaying the flight going back to bangkok

a series of rules proposed by the government will set strict limits on when where and how march of the volunteers the anthem of the people's republic since one thousand nine hundred and forty nine can be performed state run xinhua news agency reported friday
the anthem is not allowed to be played or sung at private weddings and funerals dancing parties commercial events or any other setting with an inappropriate atmosphere
when singing the anthem people should dress appropriately stand still and be full of energy according to the government
the rules then get technical
people must sing the powerful marching song in its entirety enunciate every word and follow the rhythm
no one is permitted to start or stop singing midway and altering the melody lyrics or musical arrangement is forbidden
no whispering applauding or talking on the phone either while the anthem is played
there is no official word yet on how violators would be punished
while some of those rules sound reasonable others may be overly harsh especially to americans who are used to hearing adaptations of the star spangled banner as varied as jimi hendrix's instrumental rock version at the woodstock music festival to whitney houston's soulful rendition before the super bowl
despite the government effort chinese people still seem to appreciate creative interpretations of their normally standardized national anthem
at an airport ceremony welcoming the visiting chinese president xi jinping this past summer a venezuelan military band led by trumpeters going either artistic or astray played a refreshingly different march of the volunteers with a new tune an extra section and a bit of jazz flair
while the leaders appeared unfazed on the tarmac video of the venezuelan performance quickly went viral across chinese cyberspace
upon learning the new anthem decree most chinese internet users seem to be taking it in stride
one widely re posted comment deadpans
at least banning the national anthem at funerals makes sense as the first verse arise
all those who refuse to be slaves 
would be so inappropriate
singing that line to an open casket would just be creepy

a russian military intelligence plane nearly collided with a commercial passenger jet south of sweden on friday the swedish air force chief said sunday
the incident in international airspace forced the passenger flight en route from denmark to sweden to change course maj. gen. micael byden said
but the russian defense ministry refuted the notion that one of its warplanes nearly collided with a passenger jet
and a spokesman for scandinavian airlines said reports of danger to the plane or passengers were blown out of proportion
knut morten johansen said the flight wasn't forced to change course but that the pilot took normal advice from air traffic control
no security borders were breached he said adding that it was a totally safe flight
byden said swedish fighter jets were immediately deployed to identify the aircraft and later determined it was a russian intelligence plane
he said the russian military aircraft's transponders were turned off to avoid commercial radar
a russian defense ministry spokesman maintained the flight was a safe distance from civilian aircraft
no prerequisites existed for an air accident related with a flight of a russian warplane in the international air space over the baltic sea on friday maj. gen. igor konashenkov said sunday according to russia's state run tass news agency
the flight was being made strictly in compliance with international air space rules not violating borders of other countries and at a safe distance from traffic routes of civilian aircraft he said
konashenkov said the russian plane was more than seventy kilometers from the flight route of a passenger jet
nato jets scrambled more than four hundred times this year for russian intercepts

maybe something like the ocean spiral an underwater metropolis that generates energy from the seabed and is capable of providing homes and accommodation for five thousand people
sure such blue sky thinking may only seem plausible in the world of hollywood cgi but this is the futuristic concept proposed by japanese construction firm shimizu corp
according to literature released by the company expertise is being sought from tokyo university japanese government ministries as well as energy firms to bring the project to life
shimizu also say projects like the ocean spiral may be necessary in the future to confront increasing global problems such as rising sea levels and the need to create new clean energy sources
divided into three distinctive zones the structure will stretch all the way to the crushing black depths two point eight miles under the sea off the coast of japan
a giant sphere with a diameter five hundred meters situated just below the surface will form the first section and house residential zones businesses and hotels
this inhabited area will be connected to a nine mile spiral that that descends to the seabed where a deep sea submarine port and factory will create the energy required to power the sphere by using micro organisms that turn carbon dioxide into methane
if that's not high tech enough power generators situated along the spiral will then use differences in seawater temperature to create additional energy by applying thermal conversion technologies
shimizu has a history of imaginative high concept projects including a space hotel and floating botanical cities
the company says the ocean spiral would take five years to build and the technology required will be ready in fifteen years
funding for what is likely to be a cash intensive exercise will also have to be secured
until such times arrive all we're left with is a series of cool artist renderings to whet our appetites

turkish police on sunday arrested senior journalists media executives and even the scriptwriter for a popular television series on charges of forming leading and being a member of an armed terrorist organization
the more than two dozen arrests followed another series of police raids on december seventeen of last year in which prominent supporters of the government including the sons of ministers and the head of a state owned bank were interrogated on charges of corruption
in almost all cases those year old charges have been dropped
the current crop of detentions are people associated with the influential gulen religious movement and whose followers have an active network of schools and businesses
the government accuses the movement of infiltrating the police and judiciary
among those now detained are ekrem dumanli editor in chief of zaman the country's widest circulating newspaper
police arriving at seven point three zero a.m. were greeted by scores of protesters shouting a free media can not be silenced
journalists and gulen supporters had mounted a vigil after tweets from fuatavni a reliable but anonymous source had warned of the raid
police retreated only to reappear in the afternoon when dumanli gave himself up voluntarily
also in custody are hidayet karaca the head of the gulen affiliated samanyolu television as well as the director producers and writer of long running political soap operas that cast aspersions on the government's attempt to broker a deal with kurdish militants by depicting it as a conspiracy hatched in the corridors of tehran
for the past year the government has been waging a campaign against the islamic spiritual leader fethullah gulen who lives in self imposed exile in the pocono mountains of pennsylvania
in the pro government press even the word pennsylvania has become synonymous with a conspiracy to create what is called a parallel state by overthrowing the elected government of recep tayyip erdogan former prime minister and now president
the gulen affiliated movement counters that these accusations are simply a smokescreen to cover up corruption in high places including the president's own family
for the past twelve months suspected gulenists in the bureaucracy have been let go from key positions and laws enacted that will shut down a chain of university tutorial colleges affiliated to the movement
whether driven by a desire to shift public attention from the anniversary of corruption probes or by public criticisms of systematic nepotism and excesses of the presidential palace these raids and arrests are politically motivated the alliance for shared values an organization that represents u.s. groups affiliated with the gulen movement said in a statement
such actions taint turkey's image around the world and raise the growing authoritarianism of the erdogan regime to a new level
until recently the gulen movement had been among erdogan's most enthusiastic supporters
the zaman media group was a cheerleader of a series of trials that involved scores of military officers convicted of trying to stage a coup d'tat
journalists critical of the gulenists political ambitions also stood trial including the freelance writer ahmet sik who spent two thousand and eleven two thousand and twelve in prison awaiting trial
sik has refused to have his revenge eaten cold
while the gulen community may have served fascism a few years ago what happened to them is also fascism he tweeted at the news of sunday's raid
indeed many observers see the crackdown as a growing example of erdogan's increasing authoritarian rule
these arrests appear to be government retribution against journalists reporting on corruption and criticizing the government
the crackdown on speech in turkey must end said daniel calingaert executive vice president of freedom house the washington based democracy watchdog that this year downgraded the turkish press from being partly free to not free
the situation changes when people
try to take control of the bureaucracy and thus declare war against the country's elected government said ahmet davutoglu erdogan's successor as prime minister
a statement by the u.s. state department last week cautioned turkey a key nato ally not to violate its own democratic foundations while drawing attention to raids against media outlets openly critical of the current turkish government

the elements hammered out in two weeks by about one hundred and ninety countries at the twenty th conference of parties will serve as the basis for an international climate treaty to be signed in paris next year the u.n
framework convention on climate change said sunday
that treaty which is supposed to detail nations responsibilities in the fight against climate change will come into effect in two thousand and twenty
the lima draft announced sunday determines that developed countries and developing nations will take on differing responsibilities in the fight against global warming in light of different national circumstances
the details of those responsibilities are to be determined later
it also calls on richer countries to help poorer ones finance their goals especially countries hurt most by the adverse effects of climate change that are working to mitigate that damage
initial disagreement between nations over the distribution of responsibilities and costs had brought negotiations to a deadlock causing the conference to be extended by two days
a handful of developed and developing countries pledged contributions to the green climate fund designed to finance sustainable development boosting it to nearly ten point two billion dollar

a story about pope francis allegedly saying animals can go to heaven went viral late last week
the problem is that it wasn't true
many erroneous news reports on this incident relied on an article that appeared in the new york times
that article alleged that the pope at a general audience at the vatican comforted a boy whose dog had died by saying
one day we will see our animals again in the eternity of christ
paradise is open to all of god's creatures
this was not what happened and in a correction now appended to that flawed article the times points out
the article also misstated what francis is known to have said
according to vatican radio francis said
the holy scripture teaches us that the fulfillment of this wonderful design also affects everything around us which was interpreted to mean he believes animals go to heaven 
so
wrong and wrong again
but even the correction at the times and elsewhere did little to stop the initial report of the story from zinging around the internet and giving new unfounded hope to animal lovers everywhere
first while i know it's tempting to write punny headlines like dogs in heaven 
pope francis leaves pearly gates open news organizations that ran the erroneous account really should hold fact checking to a higher standard
note to writers
don't rely on people for the ethical treatment of animals as a source for papal quotes
second part of the reason this story caught fire is that it sounds like something pope francis would say
in his two years as the leader of the worldwide roman catholic church francis has prioritized the lowly
by extension he must love puppies and kitties right 
as david gibson of religion news service points out this isn't the first time such a myth about this pope has spread
last year news reports said he was sneaking out of the vatican at night to feed the homeless around rome
a nice thought but also not true
the media and the public are so primed for francis to say novel things and disregard staid customs that the story was too good to check out
it fit with the pattern gibson writes
the animals can go to heaven meme also paints francis as a stirrer of theological controversy which brings me to my third point
people have strong feelings about whether they will spend the afterlife with their deceased beloved pets
this is where i should be honest and admit i'm not the world's biggest animal lover
a bite when i was a young child instilled a lasting fear of most dogs especially big ones
but i have loved some animals including my sister's dog buddy who died earlier this year
lots of friends tried to comfort her with the rainbow bridge story which says that animals wait in a heaven like place to be reunited with their owners in the hereafter
this is definitely not catholic teaching but its popularity reveals the desire of people to believe that their pets lives have meaning
while the catechism of the catholic church which contains official church teaching does not address the issue directly it does make clear that animals do not have the same immortal souls of humans and thus would not be eligible to enter the pearly gates so to speak
the catechism says we should not mistreat animals but points out that god made them for humans stewardship and that we should not spend money on them that should as a priority go to the relief of human misery
one can love animals
one should not direct to them the affection due only to persons
the quote that paradise is open to all of god's creatures which was mistakenly attributed to the current pope is now being attributed by the times and others to a previous one paul vi who died in one thousand nine hundred and seventy eight although the attribution here is also not particularly decisive
even if it were just because a pope says something doesn't mean church teaching has changed
my apologies to all the animal rights activists vegans and everyone who has ever lost a pet who got so excited yesterday
while catholics believe that their leader is infallible that doctrine is a lot more complicated than meaning that everything that comes out of the pope's mouth is the gospel truth
also it's important to note that paul vi's alleged comments apparently were in response to a young boy whose dog had recently died
in the catholic church we call that being pastoral
in other words the pope was trying to comfort the boy and provide solace not doctrinal instruction
what is true is that francis has been vocal about the importance of caring for creation
the source of this whole controversy was a late november talk about how the end times will result in a new creation
but neither he nor pope paul vi went so far as to ascribe eternal souls to animals that would be comparable to humans
but as this whole incident illustrates people will believe what they want to believe

two american soldiers and at least nineteen afghans were killed in a spate of attacks in afghanistan friday and saturday some of which were claimed by the taliban officials said
the violence began friday when a bomb explosion hit a convoy of nato led international security assistance force troops
two american soldiers were killed in that blast a u.s. defense official said saturday on condition of anonymity
isaf which also reported the attack but did not release the nationalities of the victims said the attack happened in eastern afghanistan
the taliban claimed responsibility
spokesman zabiullah mujahid tweeted that a u.s. convoy had been targeted in bagram district and claimed five americans were killed
on saturday morning twelve afghan civilians who were clearing mines in southern helmand province died in an attack according to omar zwak a spokesman for the provincial governor
the civilians were defusing devices planted by the taliban to target military tanks and vehicles in an area between shorabak and nad ali districts of southern helmand he said
afghan security forces who arrived at the scene of the attack killed three of the militants and arrested four others
the taliban claimed responsibility for the attack and said those killed were soldiers and not genuine mine clearers
unknown gunmen in kabul killed atiquallah raufi head of the afghan supreme court secretariat saturday morning said hashmat stanikzai spokesman for kabul's police chief
that afternoon a suicide bomber targeted a bus carrying afghan national army personnel in the guzargah area of kabul on saturday afternoon said sediq sediqqi a spokesman for the afghan interior ministry
six army personnel were killed and eighteen other people were injured including two women bystanders he said
the taliban spokesman mujahid claimed responsibility for the blast in an e mail
he said that from now on taliban attacks against foreign and afghan forces would be stepped up
in the past couple of months the taliban have targeted many afghan national army buses and other vehicles
two days ago a bus carrying army personnel to work was targeted by a suicide bomber
five servicemen were killed and twelve more were injured
after many attacks on army buses especially during the morning and evening rush hour periods kabul residents are worried
some have called on the afghan defense ministry to change the way it transports army personnel
hashmatullah who witnessed saturday's attack said
the defense ministry should stop using big buses to avoid being an easy target and its personnel should use different routes to commute to work
he said that this way the lives of both army personnel and civilians who are traveling on the same roads would be saved
the taliban issued a separate warning saturday via facebook to media critical of the group saying that from now on will not stay silent and tolerate their actions and by using every possible way attacks will be carried out against them so immorality is annihilated from its root in our country
the continuing violence comes as afghan forces prepare to take on greater responsibility for ensuring the country's security as international forces transition to a supporting role
at the end of december u.s. forces will end their combat role in afghanistan and instead focus on counterterrorism missions and training advising and assisting afghan troops
nonetheless nearly eleven thousand u.s. troops will remain in afghanistan in the beginning of two thousand and fifteen
american forces will drop to five thousand five hundred in two thousand and sixteen and by two thousand and seventeen the coalition will consolidate to kabul
hagel
more u.s. troops than planned will remain in afghanistan next year

legislators in the capital of china's restive far western xinjiang province passed a law wednesday to prohibit residents from wearing burqas in public state media reported thursday highlighting the government's continued campaign against religious extremism
the new ban in urumqi was first reported on ts.cn a xinjiang government run website and later widely published by other state media outlets
the ordinance name suggests it targets outer garments covering someone's full body including the face which is called a burqa in some islamic traditions
a spate of recent violent incidents has rocked xinjiang a resource rich region long inhabited by the turkic speaking largely muslim uyghurs
the arrival of waves of han chinese the country's predominant ethnic group over the past decades has fueled ethnic tensions
chinese officials have blamed the recent attacks on uyghur separatists whom they also label religious extremists seeking to establish an independent state
the ts.cn story mentioned the urumqi law was submitted to the provincial legislature for final approval before it could be implemented
in august another city in xinjiang banned people wearing islamic style clothing and large beards from riding public buses during a provincial sporting event according to state media
news reports at the time said karamay city authorities targeted veils large beards as well as three types of islamic dresses including those with the star and crescent symbol
dozens of bus stations in the city were said to be manned by security personnel to conduct checks and report violators to the police
while the measures in karamay didn't openly single out uyghurs exiled uyghur rights groups have condemned them calling the ban a green light for racism and discrimination
those restrictions came a month after authorities in xinjiang banned students and civil servants from fasting during ramadan the muslim holy month
amnesty international has said uyghurs face widespread discrimination in employment housing and educational opportunities as well as curtailed religious freedom and political marginalization
other critics including exiled uyghur activists have attributed the rise of violence in xinjiang to beijing's increasingly repressive rule there a claim the government vehemently denies
on monday a court in urumqi convicted more than a dozen suspects with uyghur sounding names for their roles in two separate violent attacks in the city earlier this year
eight people were sentenced to death while five others received suspended death sentences

can you take non muslim women and children captive 
yes says isis
can you have sex with them even prepubescent girls 
yes according to the islamist extremist group
can you sell them or give them as gifts to others 
the answer is yes once again
people in mosul the iraqi city now under control of the group calling itself the islamic state got these and other messages loud and clear after sunset prayers friday when armed men handed out a color printed pamphlet question and answers on female slaves and their freedom three residents told cnn
people started gathering in small groups chattering about this said one of the men whom cnn didn't name for security reasons
most are shocked but can not do much about it
the document was first printed in october or november then later posted on an isis website
it has gotten more publicity recently because of the middle east media research institute an independent washington based nonprofit whose advisory board includes former national security agency director michael v. hayden onetime cia director james woolsey and ex u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld
the idea that isis is kidnapping selling and raping women and children is hardly surprising
many such accounts have surfaced since the group began its often brutal run through syria and iraq including chilling stories from members of the yazidi religious minority
and these are on top of other horrific allegations such as the killings and mistreatment of innocent civilians simply because they didn't subscribe to isis extreme take on sharia law
and that's the thing about isis
its militants have justified their actions like the beheadings of journalists and aid workers in god's name
even then it is rare to see its rationale laid out as plainly as in question and answers on female slaves and their freedom
in the document for instance it is explained that capturing women is permissible if they are nonbelievers
it adds female slaves are the women that muslims took from their enemies
much of the pamphlet talks about isis policy on having sexual intercourse with a female slave something that the group cites the quran to justify
if she was a virgin he can have intercourse with her immediately after the ownership is fulfilled isis explains
if she was not a virgin her uterus must be purified
there are other rules as well like that two men who co own a captive can't both have sex with her and that a man can't have intercourse with his wife's slave
as to girls
it is permissible to have intercourse with the female slave who hasn't reached puberty if she is fit for intercourse the document reads
however if she is not fit for intercourse he can only enjoy her without intercourse
the qanda is clear that young and old the captors have full control of their captives
as such the isis document claims it is permissible to buy sell or give as a gift female captives and slaves for they are merely property
in response to the question of whether a female slave can buy her freedom the answer is yes she can
the document also says that freeing a slave is something a sinner who has committed an act like unintentional murder or perjury can do for his sin to be forgiven
alternative actions are fasting for two consecutive months or feeding hungry people
the pamphlet sets a few other guidelines such as that a captive mother can't be separated from her young children and that an impregnated captive can not be sold
beating a female slave for discipline is ok but beating her for pleasure or as a form of torture is not
there are fewer rules for the captives themselves though the isis pamphlet does identify one thing as the gravest of sins running away from one's master
this document marks the most detailed albeit not first justification for enslaving nonbelievers as defined by isis
time and again the group cites the quran and its view of sharia law
isis is drawing these rulings from ancient middle eastern and mediterranean codes of conduct for war and prisoners said abbas barzegar professor of religious studies at georgia state university
muslim leaders and lay practitioners the world over continue to condemn isis and find its alien interpretation of islam grotesque and abhorrent
unfortunately in the context of failed states and civil wars most sane voices are often the most drowned out
none of isis rationalizations hold up seton hall university law school professor bernard freamon wrote on cnn dot com last month
this argument is plainly wrong hypocritical and astonishingly ahistorical relying on male fantasies inspired by stories from the days of imperial islam said freamon
it is also an affront to right thinking muslims everywhere and a criminal perversion of islamic law particularly its primary source the glorious quran

two bombs explosions at a market in the central nigerian city of jos left thirty two people dead a government agency reported marking the latest instance of violence to hit the volatile region
nigeria's state broadcaster nta reported the explosions took place thursday at the terminus area of the jos market
according to mohammed adams a security guard there a young man walked into the market with a small cart claiming he was carrying yams
he kept moving before detonating one device killing at least two people
people chased him but couldn't stop him before he managed to blow himself up adams said
the security guard initially told cnn that at least twelve people were dead
on friday nigeria's national emergency management agency said that the bomb blasts killed thirty two people and injured forty five others
it was not immediately clear if the bomber was among those counted as dead
located about two hundred and fifty kilometers northwest of abuja the nation's capital jos is in an area that has been beset by violence in recent years
much of that fighting has pitted nigerian troops against boko haram the islamist terror group trying to impose its strict version of sharia law across the african nation
citizens have repeatedly been caught up in the mayhem such as mass kidnappings of women and children as well as bombings of schools churches and mosques blamed on boko haram
there was no immediate claim of responsibility for thursday's attack
however boko haram has been tied to violence in jos before including a double car bombing at the same market in may that killed one hundred and eighteen people

can animals go to heaven 
some people all over the world have been excited in recent days about reports by news agencies worldwide including one from cnn declaring that pope francis apparently believes they can
it turns out it's unclear what he believes about this
a previous pope paul vi had no doubts
one day we will again see our animals in the eternity of christ paul once told a boy grieving the loss of his pet
that quote from the pontiff who reigned from one thousand nine hundred and sixty three until his death in one thousand nine hundred and seventy eight was inaccurately attributed to francis
the confusion may have begun when italian daily newspaper corriere della sera referred to paul's quote in a story that carried the headline the pope and animals
heaven is open to all creatures 
the story itself does not indicate francis said that
instead it refers back to paul vi
the writer for the newspaper pointed to something francis actually did say
sacred scripture teaches us that the fulfillment of this marvelous plan can not but involve everything that surrounds us and came from the heart and mind of god
that remark the writer suggested widened the hope of salvation to animals and all of creation
the headline on the article quoted francis as saying heaven is open to all creatures
but there's no sign francis said that
a search through the current pope's writings and remarks showed no immediate sign that he has taken a clear position on the question
pope francis to visit united states for first time next fall
while catholic teachings neither reject nor reaffirm the notion that animals have souls
there is no hard and fast answer in catholicism to this question
drugs capitalism homosexuality little is off limits for outspoken pope
it's an emotional question for many people
amy kitchens pollick of decatur alabama shared an anecdote from her childhood on friday
when she was ten years old death claimed her beloved cat big tom
her father had tears in his eyes when he told her now little one
the bible says the lord sees even every sparrow that falls pollick wrote on facebook
if he sees every sparrow he's not going to forget about a good old kitty like big tom 
i've held that in my heart ever since she wrote


the air traffic control system for london airspace has been restored after a technical failure the uk air traffic management company nats said friday but travelers can expect disruptions and flight cancellations
we are in the process of returning to normal operations
we apologize for any delays and the inconvenience this may have caused nats said
it later issued a release saying that it had ruled out a power outage as a cause of the fault which resulted in the temporary closure of london's airspace
travelers passing through london can expect delays or disruption to their flights for hours to come
heathrow airport said the nats systems were now working and stable but about fifty flights had been canceled by five thirty p.m. gmt with the number expected to rise over the evening and into saturday
the earlier problem will cause delays and cancellations to flights for the rest of the day and is likely to have a knock on effect on some services tomorrow because aircraft and crew will now be out of position heathrow said in a statement
passengers due to depart today and tomorrow should check the status of their flight with their airline before traveling to heathrow
we are very sorry for the disruption to passengers journeys
extra staff will be on duty to help passengers it said
luton gatwick and stansted airports which all serve london also warned of delays
hundreds of unclaimed bags sat beside carousels inside terminal fifth baggage claim
a baggage handler told cnn some people grew tired of waiting and left without collecting their bags
carousels were not assigned for some incoming flights
a spokesman for budget airline ryanair robin kiely told cnn that flights were expected to resume with delays but that cancellations were not expected
kiely slammed nats over the problem saying it was unacceptable that its system had dropped for the second time in twelve months particularly on a busy friday in the run up to christmas
paul beauchamp a spokesman for nats said we think there is problem with the flight data system although not exactly sure at this time
he told cnn its systems were not hacked and that idea has been ruled out completely
aviation security expert glenn schoen told cnn the incident had exposed a weakness in the air traffic system a problem that needs to be addressed urgently
we're going to have a major digital forensic effort here i think driven by british authorities maybe with assistance from international aviation authorities to get to the bottom of this as quickly as possible he said
the disconcerting aspect here is the humongous impact of what appears to be one technical error
it doesn't appear like a whole group of people made a mistake or a whole group of systems all had an error at the same time so it tells us somewhere in how the system is configured now there are vulnerabilities we did not know about and apparently have not been accounted for in terms of control measures
british airways offered refunds or the chance to rebook to any of its passengers not wishing to travel friday in light of the problems
we anticipate disruption to both departing and arriving flights but will do all we can to minimize any impact it said in a statement
it's not just uk travelers who will be affected by the glitch
all flights that are supposed to fly london from charles de gaulle are delayed a representative for paris charles de gaulle airport told cnn
flights from tunisia will be landing at charles de gaulle instead of london
mary ryan a spokeswoman for united airlines said none of its inbound flights friday was affected but that four outbound flights were being held at the gate until the issue was resolved
a spokesman for delta air lines advised passengers bound for london on friday to check the status of their flights before traveling
the european air traffic control network eurocontrol earlier said no flights would be accepted in or out of london until seven p.m
the issue affected the air traffic control center in swanwick which controls all air traffic routes in southern england and wales up to approximately manchester
a second air traffic control center at prestwick in scotland takes over air routes from there
it was not affected nats said
cnn's jim boulden said more than eighty airlines fly into and out of heathrow with some two hundred thousand people passing through the airport daily
the system is working fine but it's the aircraft that are in the wrong place it's the aircraft that are delayed he said friday evening
there's a number of planes that have been diverted to other places
they still have to get here to london
schoen the aviation security expert said the resulting effects would be significant
he said they include the parking of the aircraft refueling servicing of the aircraft the security guarding and checking of the aircraft the handling of the passengers at different airports where they're not really planning on that kind of capacity for the coming night perhaps this is happening overseas as well flights that were en route to the united kingdom now diverting to other places
hopefully this will not affect some of the biggest busiest flights
think about you piloting an airbus a three hundred and eighty en route to london and you needing to divert and having to fit that into a schedule of another airport
so these are some major challenges throughout the system that we're hoping and we're assuming authorities not just in the uk but elsewhere as well are ready to handle now

the british government asked the u.s. senate intelligence committee to redact small parts of the panel's report that criticized the cia's harsh interrogation program a representative for prime minister david cameron said friday
the comment came in response to a question from cnn about whether the uk government had seen the report on the cia's enhanced interrogation program before it was released to the public this week and whether london had asked for redactions or changes
the u.s. gave our agencies limited sight of some sections of the executive summary before its publication cameron's representative said about the report on the cia program which critics call torture
our agencies highlighted a small number of issues in the proposed text where changes would be necessary to protect uk national security and intelligence operations
none of these redactions related to allegations of uk involvement in detainee mistreatment
information on what was altered or obscured in the four hundred and ninety nine page executive summary at the uk government's request wasn't immediately available


the korean air executive who kicked up a fuss over a bag of nuts will resign from her remaining posts with the airline the company chairman who is also her father said friday
the executive heather cho found herself at the center of a media storm after she ordered that a plane turn back to the gate and that a flight attendant be removed all because she was served nuts in a bag instead of on a plate in first class
although her role put her in charge of in flight service she was only a passenger on the flight and was not flying in an official capacity
the incident which took place last week at new york's jfk airport stirred anger among the south korean public over cho's behavior
cho whose korean name is cho hyun ah resigned tuesday from the airline's catering and in flight sales business and from its cabin service and hotel business divisions the company said
but the forty year old kept her title as a vice president of the national carrier according to company spokesman
that's going to change her father cho yang ho said friday as he made a public apology for what happened
she will be resigning from the vice president job and positions held in affiliate companies he said
asked by reporters how the incident could have happened the company chairman blamed himself saying he'd raised her badly
a local english language newspaper the korea times said her behavior has deepened public resentment of south korea's large family owned corporations known as chaebol
through her outburst of anger she not only caused inconvenience to kal passengers but also to those on other flights the newspaper said in an editorial tuesday
the most annoying type of airline passenger is
south korean authorities are now investigating the incident which occurred on a flight due to take off for incheon international airport near seoul
cho arrived at the ministry of land infrastructure and transport on friday as part of the investigation according to local tv coverage
she spoke in such a low voice that it was inaudible from the tv footage
korean air apologized for any inconvenience to those on the flight and said there had been no safety issues involved
the plane arrived at its destination eleven minutes behind schedule according to the south korean news agency yonhap
even though it was not an emergency situation backing up the plane to order an employee to deplane was an excessive act the airline said earlier this week
we will re educate all our employees to make sure service within the plane meets high standards
the airline also issued an apology on heather cho's behalf yonhap reported in which she asked for forgiveness and said she would take full responsibility for the incident
according to her biography on the website of nanyang technological university heather cho joined the airline in one thousand nine hundred and ninety nine and has since been actively involved in establishing a new corporate identity for korean air
she studied at cornell university and the university of southern california

in an interview with brazilian broadcaster tv globo the alleged killer sailson jose das gracas said that he carried out the first slaying when he was seventeen and continued to kill over the next decade
i started robbing purses and small things like that he told tv globo
and as i got older i started having a different thoughts
my thoughts started changing
from stealing i started thinking about killing
sailson reported to be twenty six years old said he didn't kill impulsively but stalked his victims
rio police said they arrested sailson on wednesday on suspicion of killing a woman in the suburb of nova iguacu
he confessed to that homicide and then told police about the other killings they said
sailson described his need to kill as pathological
when i didn't kill i would get nervous he told tv globo
i would pace around the house and then when i killed it calmed me
police chief marcelo machado told tv globo that sailson is also suspected of killing a two year old boy the son of one of the dead women
specialized police teams are carrying out an investigation into his claims
we must carefully examine one by one machado said
police said they had located four other cases from the homicide division that had the same modus operandi presented by sailson who told them he used knives to kill
police said they had also arrested a man and woman who sailson said had told him to kill the latest victim
the self declared killer said he had no regrets about his actions and would kill again if set free
what is done is done he told the tv network
if i leave here in ten fifteen twenty years i'll go back to doing the same thing


mikhail furtado was extremely worried about his twelve th grade exams
a few days before he was due to get his results his father walked in and found him dead
i opened the cottage door put the light on and i found him hanging
he was hanging anthony furtado says
when the results came out his father learned that mikhail had sailed through with good grades
he says he still can't bring himself to go and collect the results
but furtado is trying to use his devastating experience to benefit others
he provides counseling and is a regular at suicide prevention workshops
sometimes at the end i do break down he says
highest rate in the world among young
the scale of the problem among india's young people is huge
according to a recent world health organization report india has the highest suicide rate in the world for the fifteen to twenty nine age group
it stands at thirty five point five per one hundred thousand people for two thousand and twelve the last year for which numbers are available
across all age groups nearly two hundred and sixty thousand people in india killed themselves that year
bobby zachariah who runs a suicide prevention group says he blames a breakdown in india's traditional family structure
there were big families there was a lot of support available he says
nowadays there is one child in the family zachariah says
and the kind of parenting styles that were applied to them when they were kids doesn't apply to their children any more
some experts say a key problem is that families brush mental health issues under the carpet rather than facing them head on
mental illness is like any other illness and is treatable says dr. arun john of the vandrevala foundation which aims to help people with mental health issues and other problems
this can only be tackled once greater awareness is created he says calling for the establishment of helplines
the indian government took a step toward reducing some of the stigma around suicide this week making it no longer a crime to attempt it
officials were acting on a recommendation of a law commission report that said the desire to commit suicide should be seen as a condition needing treatment not punishment
but in a rapidly developing india pressures remain high to get good grades and high paying jobs
parents and schools do not make a child mentally and psychologically strong enough to handle pressure john says
this leads to a feeling of worthlessness he adds
i'm so much better now 
one twenty year old man in the city of pune near mumbai talked about reasons behind his brush with death
the man who declined to be identified said he never fared well in school and had few friends
he had problems with his girlfriend and felt his parents didn't understand him
in his depression and desperation he would cut himself he said showing the scars
he attempted suicide but was saved by a timely medical intervention
nowadays he gets counseling and enjoys playing the guitar
he also counsels others
it helps them to know i've been there he says
and that i'm so much better now

a recently released cia cable casts heavy doubt on a key claim used by the bush administration to justify the two thousand and three u.s. led invasion of iraq
it discounts intelligence that said mohammed atta one of the nine eleven ringleaders met with an iraqi official in the czech republic a few months before the attacks
the bush administration which maintained that atta had met with iraqi agent ahmad al anian in prague in april two thousand and one had used the report to link the september eleven attacks to iraq
cia director john brennan included a portion of the cable in a letter to sen. carl levin d michigan
levin the retiring chairman of the senate armed services committee made the letter public on thursday
the cable reads that there is not one usg or fbi expert that.has said they have evidence or know that was indeed
in fact the analysis has been quite the opposite
in a two thousand and one interview with nbc's meet the press then vice president dick cheney said it's been pretty well confirmed that did go to prague and he did meet with a senior official of the iraqi intelligence service in last april several months before the attack
cheney repeated those claims which were based on a single source as the nation prepared for war
the fbi and cia had both warned that they were skeptical that atta was in prague according to brennan's letter
he noted that both organizations had said previously that identifications such as the one initially made by the single source who reported the meeting could be faulty and would require further evidence
the march thirteen two thousand and three cable sent by the cia represents a last known attempt to refute any existence of the meeting and with it a nine eleven link to iraq
an invasion force led by the united states entered iraq one week later
cheney on torture report
the report's full of crap 

washington cia director john brennan on thursday defended harsh interrogation techniques as providing useful information to authorities including in the raid that led to the death of osama bin laden
but he said it is unknowable what information could specifically be attributed to those techniques
it is our considered view that the detainees who were subjected to enhanced interrogation techniques provided information that was useful and was used in the ultimate operation to go against bin laden brennan said
brennan's comments in a rare news conference come two days after a senate panel released a blockbuster five hundred and twenty eight page report detailing enhanced interrogation techniques including mock executions rectal rehydration sleep deprivation and beatings in interrogations in the mid two thousand s
he admitted that some cia officers actions were not authorized were abhorrent and rightly should be repudiated by all
and we fell short in holding some officers accountable for their mistakes
brennan acknowledged that the agency sometimes exceeded its legal authority during interrogations of terrorism suspects
he said detainees who faced enhanced interrogation techniques did provide some information that provided useful as well as other information that didn't
he said whether those interrogations had anything to do with that information is unknowable
let me be clear
we have not concluded that it was the eits within that program that allowed us to obtain useful information from the detainees subjected to them he said
but he staunchly defended the agency during the forty five minute news conference adding
cia officers actions that did comport with the law and policy should neither be criticized nor conflated with the actions of the few who did not follow the guidance issued
brennan opened his remarks with a vivid depiction of the events of the sept. eleven two thousand and one terrorist attacks and described the atmosphere going into fighting terrorism and collecting intelligence in the immediate aftermath of the attacks
there were no easy answers and whatever your views are on enhanced interrogation techniques our nation and in particular this agency did a lot of things right during this difficult time to keep this country strong and secured brennan said
brennan praised those who worked with him but he added the agency was unprepared to conduct a detention and interrogation program and our officers inadequately developed and monitored its initial activities
brennan never used the word torture to describe the cia's tactics
and he deflected a question about whether in the interest of transparency he supported the senate intelligence committee's decision to release its report
i think there's been more than enough transparency that's happened over the last couple days he said
i think it's over the top
brennan said it's lamentable that the senate panel didn't conduct interviews with cia agents a contrast he said with its handling of a report on iraq's lack of weapons of mass destruction which included interviews with more than two hundred officers
his strongest criticism of the report was with its contention that the cia misled the public and government officials including then president george w. bush
that brennan said is untrue a stance former vice president dick cheney backed up in an interview with fox news on wednesday night
still he didn't fault the report's finding that the cia's tactics were harsh and at times went beyond the legal authority bush's justice department said the agency had
many aspects of their conclusions are sound and consistent with our own prior findings brennan said
over the years internal agency reviews including numerous investigations by our office of the inspector general found fault in the cia's running of the program
we have acknowledged these mistakes
brennan was the cia's deputy executive director while the tactics were being used
he said he had some visibility into what was happening but that he wasn't in the chain of command for that program and didn't say whether he had made any effort to push for changes at the time
he also noted that the program for using enhanced interrogation techniques was ended in two thousand and seven
in light of the fact that these techniques were banned seven years ago however my fervent hope is that we can put aside this debate and move on to issues that are relevant to our current national security challenges brennan said
meanwhile one of brennan's sharpest critics sen. dianne feinstein the chairwoman of the committee behind the report live tweeted along with the press conference and sharply rebutted several points throughout his press conference
this story was updated to include additional information

police in new delhi say yadav's address and background weren't verified in his driver registration
the revelations from uttar pradesh police add to concerns about how he was allowed to operate as a driver for uber
yadav was accused of rape last year and later released on bail singh said
he was also arrested on charges of molestation in two thousand and three of carrying illegal firearms in two thousand and six and of disorderly and dangerous behavior in two thousand and nine according to singh
in new delhi he spent seven months in jail in between two thousand and eleven and two thousand and twelve during a trial on charges of rape of which he was acquitted said the city's deputy police commissioner madhur verma

uber wasn't immediately available for comment wednesday on the disclosures about yadav's record in uttar pradesh but on thursday it released a statement saying it was doing everything in its power to assist the authorities to help bring the perpetrator to justice
the company will suspend its operations in new delhi it said as it re evaluates its verification processes and begins re reviewing rider feedback on every driver partner across india
it also will address its driver screening processes and will evaluate options like background checks on all drivers in india beyond what the law requires
we will come back better and stronger for the new delhi community ready to serve you again uber said in the statement


a suicide bomber detonated explosives thursday inside a french funded school in kabul during a play that condemns suicide attacks leading to deaths and numerous injuries the french foreign minister said
the attack happened at istiqlal high school a school that includes a french cultural center in the afghan capital
the taliban the islamist extremist group fighting against afghanistan's ruling government and firmly opposed by various western powers claimed responsibility according to spokesman zabihullah mujahid
around five p.m. the theater at the school in central kabul was packed for a performance of a play titled heartbeats
silence after the explosion
it abruptly ended about thirty minutes later with a very loud bang a bright light smoke and dust according to witness zahir sangar
when i tried to escape i saw tens of people covered in blood some of them were screaming and some of them were quiet the student said
acting afghan interior minister mohammad ayoub salangi said that one person was killed and fifteen others injured in the bombing
french foreign minister laurent fabius said a short time later that several people had died
it was not clear exactly how many or whether the suicide bomber was among the fatalities though fabius did say that no french citizens were among the casualties
all light must be shed on this barbaric act fabius said
and its perpetrators identified and brought to justice
french president francois hollande also issued a statement condemning what he called a heinous attack
by targeting this place of dialogue hollande said it is the culture
that terrorists have targeted


french troops killed a senior jihadist leader in northern mali a man purportedly behind a number of high profile attacks and kidnappings and ambitious and brazen enough that the united states had issued a five million dollar reward for him the french military announced thursday
ahmed el tilemsi was the military head and co founder of a jihadist group called the movement for unity and jihad in west africa one of several jihadist groups active in the region
the u.s. government designated el tilemsi a terrorist in december two thousand and twelve and offered a reward of up to five million dollar for information leading to him
he was killed wednesday night in a french military operation which was coordinated with malian forces in the gao region in mali french military officials said
one of the things that proves he was a senior chief is that when he got killed
he was accompanied by a dozen who were also ensuring his security french defense ministry spokesman sacha mandel said
about ten suspected terrorists were neutralized which means killed or taken captive according to the french military in the same operation said col. gilles jaron another french military spokesman
mali is a former french colony
according to the u.s. state department el tilemsi was among the militants who in september two thousand and eleven broke off from al qaeda in the islamic maghreb another terrorist group to form the movement for unity and jihad in west africa
a month later the group also known as mujwa abducted three aid workers from a refugee camp in western algeria
the u.s. government blames the movement for unity and jihad in west africa for an attack on a police base in tamanrasset algeria and another in ouargla algeria as well as the kidnapping of seven algerian diplomats incidents that all occurred in two thousand and twelve
the state department described el tilemsi a malian born in one thousand nine hundred and seventy seven as mujwa's military chief adding that he directly took part in the october two thousand and eleven kidnappings in western algeria
before that as a member of al qaeda in the islamic maghreb he took part in the abduction of two french nationals in the niger city of niamey the u.s. government said

at least fifty people have died in somalia after drinking contaminated water from a well in northern mogadishu an official in that east african country said thursday
osman mohamed the deputy commissioner for somalia's yaqshid district told cnn about the deaths among those who drank from the newly constructed well
more than one hundred and fifty people who had water from that well were recently hospitalized
hawo abdi a mother of four told cnn that her eight year old child is among those who died after drinking the contaminated water
while access to drinkable water has improved in recent years it still remains a major and sometimes deadly problem in some places
that's especially true in parts of africa and even more so in somalia which has some of the lowest rates of water coverage in the world
the united nations reports that one hundred and fifteen people die every hour in africa from diseases linked to inferior sanitation poor hygiene and contaminated water
of course available quality drinking water is just one of several pressing issues in somalia
the country is also dealing with persistent violence much of it linked to the militant group al shabaab
it was not immediately clear how the water that led to the recent deaths got contaminated including whether anyone or any group might be responsible

closing guantanamo
who's left and what's in the way
i've heard that the senate report on cia torture is six thousand pages long
my story though takes place elsewhere
in guantanamo away from the cia program that the report covers
the six thousand pages of the senate report are just the start of what americans have to accept happened in their name
it starts and ends in the silence of a tiny freezing cold cell alone
that's when you hold yourself in a ball and fight to ignore the confusion of what has just happened to you and the fear of what might be coming next

there are photographs of faces stuck all around the walls of this room
they demand that i identify the individuals but i can barely focus to see if i might know them
the shouting and the insults get louder and then they nod to a man in the corner
he injects me twice in the arm with some unknown substance
it's the last thing i know
the freezing cold cell
the cell door opens
this time the guards enter making awful honking noises like wild animals
i tried to refuse to eat the little food they bring me in protest at all this
the interrogator laughs at me but then turns angry
he swears loudly and pours an army meal pack over my head
they tell the man in the corner to start feeding me intravenously
he inserts the tube in two different places on my arm and makes it bleed
closing guantanamo
who's left and what's in the way
the freezing cold cell
the cell door opens
this time the guards push me on the floor and take turns trampling over my back
i tell the interrogators that i can't face not eating any more
they throw food on the floor of the room and tell me to eat like a pig
they won't let me go to the restroom
they watch as it gets more painful and laugh as they get the translator to describe how they will rape me if i pee in my pants
the freezing cold cell
the cell door opens
they make me stand and salute the american flag
i'm in a sort of cinema room where i have to watch videos of other prisoners being abused
then they tell me that i have to dance for them and run in circles whilst they pull on my chains
every time i try and refuse they touch me in my most private areas
the freezing cold cell
the cell door opens
it has rained and there are muddy puddles everywhere
i'm shackled so i can't really walk
they deliberately drag me through the muddy puddles
now it's the pornography room
awful pictures everywhere
there is one with a man and a donkey
i'm stripped naked and have my beard shaved in a gratuitous insult to my religion
i'm shown pornographic pictures of women
i'm told to make the noises of different animals and when i refuse they just hit me
it ends with them pouring cold water all over me
hours later in my cell i am discovered nearly frozen
the doctor tells them to bring me urgently to the clinic where i am given a blanket and treatment
over the next hours they observe me as i warm up
they are just waiting for the moment that they can sign off on my return to interrogation
four years ago six u.s. government security agencies sat together and reviewed my case
their conclusion 
that i was innocent of any crime and should be released
the dirty and sadistic methods i endured which were then taken directly to abu ghraib achieved nothing except to shame that american flag hanging in the prison corridor which i was made to salute
one hundred and thirty six prisoners are still being held at guantanamo whilst the politicians squabble over how to black out the senate report
america can not keep hiding from its past and its present like this
our stories and our continued detention can not be made to disappear

the ensuing blast killed five and wounded twelve others the defense ministry said
the taliban claimed responsibility for the attack

every week inside africa takes its viewers on a journey across africa exploring the true diversity and depth of different cultures countries and regions
mombasa kenya at the old port in mombasa southern kenya tranquil waters lap gently against the shore beneath the ghostly fort jesus garrison
today it's a pretty and peaceful scene but one that belies the port's bustling colonial past
it was at this spot just over a century ago that the ancestors of kenya's successful indian community first set foot on african soil
they came in ships and dhows having been coaxed here to build one of the continent's great railways
as that railway which was soon christened the lunatic line because of its high cost and the dangers faced by those constructing it snaked through the country towards uganda in the years that followed so did the indian community
the economic and cultural roots they laid down beside the tracks remains to this day
in quite a lot said one businesswoman of indian heritage we meet in a nearby restaurant
we have commodities transport and various other things
she tells us her grandfather first came to kenya to work on the railways and her family has been there ever since
her colleague chimes in that indians have been traders and economically they play a very big role in the kenyan economy
at a spice shop just down the road meanwhile the third generation indian owner tells me that kenyan asians are spread widely across industries like construction retail and tourism
of course merchants from india and what's now known as pakistan had come to mombasa long before the railway
the trade routes linking east africa and asia were already well established
mombasa had been a city state for over two thousand years bearing long and fruitful relations with the middle east asia and the far east
in the port's heyday there was ivory being sold like the way we sell cakes now or mahamris as we call them said historian satmbuli abdillahi nassir
there was rhinoceros horns
there was dry skin there was spices all this was happening at this port
it was the railway lines however and the need for labor that first brought a mass migration of people from the sub continent
by the mid one thousand eight hundred and ninety's the british were effectively in control of kenya and were keen to open up the country's interior and that of neighboring uganda to counter german influence in the region
having started construction of railway lines in india nearly fifty years earlier punjabi engineers and laborers had the skills the british required
more thirty thousand indentured indian workers were soon enticed to sail to mombasa and a new life in africa
the country these expectant migrants found upon arrival however was vastly different to the land of comparative business opportunity their ancestors inhabit today
work on the railways was brutally hard
by the time it had reached its destination in kisumu on the banks of lake victoria roughly six hundred and twenty five miles from mombasa around two thousand five hundred men had died
that's four people for every mile
and it wasn't just the oppressive heat and long hours workers had to contend with
the man eaters of tsavo were a pair of lions that killed anywhere between twenty eight and more than one hundred workers during the building of the railway depending which account you believe
they spread such terror that work stopped until they were eventually shot
on top of that there was also sickness and disease to contend with
many people died of malaria and black fever when they were building because of the difficult terrain and there were no medical facilities resulting many deaths said komal shah whose ancestors settled just outside nairobi after the railway was built
they had to take risks coming to this place she added
shah is one of the many kenyan asians who today run their own businesses in the westlands and parklands districts of the kenyan capital
she teaches the ancient indian discipline of yoga a far cry from the grueling and punishing work of the railway lines
but the history and contribution of shah's ancestors in building the community and the infrastructure of the country make her proud of her roots
i would not like to be distinguished as a kenyan from a different region of the world shah said
i am born here and a third generation asian kenyan
i proudly say that i am a kenyan
such open and patriotic sentiments aren't uniform across the country however
outside of the big metropolises such as nairobi and mombasa there is a more complex relationship between communities
in kisumu where the great railway ends issues of integration between kenyan asians and black africans remain
although there are rarely tensions between the groups neither mixes fully with the other
according to local mp shakeel shabbir ahmed himself a kenyan asian who married a black kenyan woman this is something that has to change
there has not been a real integration
like in mombasa and dar es salaam ahmed said
in kisumu the integration is only when it's in the shop or at the business
but when they go out of that particular environment there is very little integration either by way of recreation or other facilities
while kenyan asian's community makes a substantial economic contribution to wider society ahmed believes they should make more of an effort to mix with their compatriots and refrain from being insular
we are less than one point four percents here in kenya but we hold the purse strings to maybe thirty percents or forty percents of the economy ahmed estimates
we must remember that if we earn here we live here we must contribute to this country
that's a sentiment that the very first indian emigres to set foot in this beautiful country would have doubtless agreed with

the national transportation safety board report released december one comes nearly two years after burning and smoking batteries grounded all fifty of the world's most advanced airliners flying at the time
when you pick apart the one hundred and ten page document it reveals how any new piece of equipment can pose dangerous problems even a noncritical piece of equipment like batteries
in this situation the battery created one of the worst threats possible
an onboard fire
from a broader perspective the investigation reminds us of the heavy responsibilities shared by the world's aviation regulators and aircraft makers
the battery problems struck boeing shortly after it had rolled out what was then a new model aircraft with some of the most sophisticated technology available
it all started in january two thousand and thirteen when an empty japan airlines seven hundred and eighty seven caught fire while parked at boston's logan airport
a second battery incident nine days later in japan prompted the federal aviation administration to ground the entire dreamliner fleet while the problem was fixed
read more about the battery
now with more than two hundred dreamliners in service the faa says safer battery systems have been installed in the planes
the ntsb basically blamed the battery problem on two things
overheating from an electrical short circuit that may have been caused by manufacturing defects
allegedly unsatisfactory oversight of the manufacturing process by both the federal aviation administration and boeing
read the full ntsb report on the battery fire
to bring the investigation into sharper focus here are eight questions and answers associated with the report
one
what was the root cause of the short circuit 
it's remarkable
the investigation was unable to pinpoint the root cause of the battery cell short circuit
neither could japanese investigators although they had a theory
two
how closely does the faa monitor the development of aviation technology 
the faa allows boeing and other qualified manufacturers to use their own employees to confirm that new aircraft components meet safety regulations
they follow specific faa guidelines and submit to regular checks by faa officials
experts say more and more of that self checking oversight is moving further down the supply chain to subcontractors
ntsb investigators recommended that both the faa and boeing develop or revise processes to establish more effective oversight of suppliers
the report also called on the dreamliner's japan based battery maker gs yuasa corp. to review its cell manufacturing processes and ensure its employees are properly trained
kenneth quinn a washington based attorney who represents the battery maker said this week that gs yuasa had respectfully disagreed with a number of the observations ntsb made regarding manufacturing defects
he said the company is studying the report and is eager to implement continuous quality improvements with the suggestions of the ntsb faa and japan's aviation regulators
three
how did all this get started 
the battery like those aboard all dreamliners was a lithium ion battery a technology that airline manufacturers like as a way to save fuel costs because of its low weight
lithium ion batteries also power cell phones and laptops
it's a developing technology that has a history of overheating issues
related
watch video of the seven hundred and eighty seven that caught fire in two thousand and thirteen
the faa had already certified these batteries as safe and flight worthy
apparently they weren't
passenger safety and billions of dollars in boeing aircraft orders were at risk
officials needed to know what went wrong
that's why the faa did something next that it hadn't done in more than thirty years
it grounded an entire type of airliner nationwide
for about four months dreamliners sat idle
to fix the problem each battery was put inside a fireproof steel box to prevent the battery from catching fire
just in case the box includes vents that would force any smoke outside the plane
more insulation against heat was also added and the batteries were redesigned to charge at lower levels
in the nineteen months since the dreamliner fix there have been no reports of batteries catching fire although a seven hundred and eighty seven battery cell did overheat while on the ground earlier this year
the improvements made to the seven hundred and eighty seven battery system last year appear to have worked as designed boeing told flightglobal in a statement at the time
four
could it happen again 
boeing and the battery maker say no
t
heoretically if another dreamliner battery short circuits and overheats the system will remain safe because there won't be enough oxygen in the containment box for a fire to be possible a boeing spokeswoman said
does that make the battery maker comfortable with the fact that the root cause of the short circuit remains a mystery 
gs yuasa is very comfortable in knowing that the quality of the manufacturing processes and the redesign of the battery will prevent a situation from occurring as it did in the boston and japanese incidents said quinn
five
how important are these batteries anyway 
they're necessary but they have backups in case they fail
the batteries are used only before take off to power up the cockpit computer and to start the plane's auxiliary power unit
after takeoff unless there's a power failure these batteries are not in use because electricity to run onboard equipment is generated by the engines
even if there is a power failure which is highly unlikely there are other ways pilots can create electrical power to run the seven hundred and eighty seven's steering and other systems
for example small wind turbines called ram air turbines or rats that pop out of the aircraft to generate juice via wind power
six
will boeing and the faa develop a more effective process to oversee suppliers 
boeing says it did that already before the ntsb report
the company said it now has a more formal flow of requirements and increased interaction between boeing its suppliers and sub tier suppliers as compared to the processes in place earlier
the faa said it also has effective processes in place to identify and correct issues that emerged before and after certification of the seven hundred and eighty seven
but it also said it's still evaluating the ntsb recommendations and will provide a timely response to the board
seven
do airliner manufactures plan to use lithium ion batteries on new aircraft models 
immediately after the dreamliner's troubles boeing competitor airbus announced it was pulling lithium ion batteries from early production models of its new a three hundred and fifty aircraft and going with traditional and heavier nickel cadmium batteries
but in september airbus did a one hundred and eighty
it said it planned to switch back to lithium ion batteries on a three hundred and fifty s set to be delivered in two thousand and sixteen
airbus chief designer told bloomberg the company can mitigate any risks to zero
boeing said this week it would decide whether to use lithium ion batteries in new planes on a case by case basis
eight
were there any surprises in the report 
yes
a random unrelated problem with a new type of cockpit voice recorder
the report revealed that a new recorder on the japan airlines dreamliner didn't record voices very well a situation that could impede future aircraft investigations the ntsb said
almost all crew conversations recorded by the cockpit voice recorder were completely obscured by ambient cockpit noise according to the report
the faa should require boeing to improve the quality of the audio on the recording device the ntsb said
boeing said it's still examining the ntsb recommendations
overall for aviation enthusiasts and fans of the dreamliner the report offered a mountain of insider data about the popular aircraft
as quinn the gs yuasa attorney put it i think we can all rest assured that this is the most investigated battery incident ever

but a day after his death the two sides continued to offer contrasting accounts of what killed him
palestinians say that autopsy results show that abu ein died from a harsh blow to his diaphragm and lungs that excessive use of force in conjunction with the inhalation of tear gas were contributing factors
palestinian minister of civil affairs hussein al sheikh told the palestinian ma'an news agency on thursday that doctors from palestinian territories jordan and israel participated in the autopsy
he said that while israeli doctors admitted the results they did not sign the medical report
on the other hand a preliminary autopsy report issued by the israeli government said abu ein's death was caused by a blockage of the coronary artery because of hemorrhaging
stress could have caused the bleeding the report said suggesting the poor condition of abu ein's heart caused him to be more sensitive to stress
cnn spoke to dr. ahmed bitawi at the ramallah medical complex who ruled out ninety nine point nine nine percents that abu ein's death was brought on by a heart attack
bitawi the director general of the hospital said the cause of death was asphyxiation
that abu ein choked to death on his own vomit brought on by gas inhalation
abu ein died after clashes with israeli soldiers midday wednesday in the palestinian village of turmusaya which is northeast of the west bank city of ramallah
he was a minister in the fatah party and head of the committee to resist the wall and settlements and he was participating in nonviolent demonstrations to mark international human rights day longtime chief palestinian negotiator saeb erakat said in a statement
pictures from various news agencies depict an israeli soldier with his hands to abu ein's neck followed by another showing him on the ground
the official palestinian news agency wafa meanwhile reported that the palestinian official lost consciousness after he inhaled tear gas and an israeli soldier hit him in the chest
the israeli soldiers called abu ein by name and seemed to be focused on him witness kamal abu safaka told cnn
there was a lot of pushing kicking and punching by the soldiers

when abu ein tried to intercede they hit him on the chest with a rifle butt and grabbed him by the throat and pushed him back and then threw a large amount of tear gas and stun grenades
israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu said israel will investigate the death
declaring three days of mourning palestinian authority president mahmoud abbas slammed abu ein's death as an intolerable barbaric act according to wafa
what happened is a crime by all means we can not sit idle and silent this crime he said later on palestinian television
for that this leadership is meeting now to decide what it wants and i say honestly all options are open for discussion and for implementation

we don't have any other solutions
on thursday thousands of palestinian mourners marched in abu ein's funeral procession as he was taken from the presidential compound to a cemetery

australians expect a lot of their country's consular offices when traveling overseas
at least some of them do
in recent years aussies abroad have hit up their government's local overseas reps for everything from help packing their bags to looking after their pets to providing armored cars to the equivalent of a get out of jail card
the australian government is hitting back in a manner of speaking
last week the country's department of foreign affairs and trade which is responsible for consular services announced a new three year consular strategy that will in part cut back on services rendered to pesky nationals who come calling with petty problems tying up valuable resources
nobody should argue against helping those in genuine trouble but far too often our valuable consular assets are being diverted to help those who are more than capable of taking personal responsibility to solve their problems wrote minister of foreign affairs julie bishop in a public scold titled australian travelers need to become more self reliant
bishop's article appeared in the interpreter a foreign policy website published by the sydney based lowry institute for international policy
there is a limit to what our consular officers can do an exasperated sounding bishop continued
the government is sending a clear message to individuals who have unreasonable or unrealistic demands
consular assistance is not a right and if you deliberately or willfully abuse it you can not expect more than the absolute minimum level of assistance and advice
how outrageous have some of those requests for help been 
behold this list of twenty rather unsusual pleas for assistance provided by dfat
one
a traveler who was destitute refused to return to australia without their pet which could not be returned for quarantine reasons
two
a mother who wanted the embassy in bangkok to book accommodation and a return ticket to australia for her son then provide an embassy driver to take him to the airport
three
a request from an australian traveler for dfat to feed her dogs while she was away
four
i'm attending a conference overseas with a large group of australians but i have heard it is a dangerous city
can the high commission arrange for a risk assessment and some armored cars 
we only need them for a week
five
multiple enquiries to embassies overseas as to the closest pub televising the state of origin game
six
an australian who had his laptop stolen overseas requested that embassy staff pick him up from the airport loan him a laptop and provide him with office space for a few days
seven
a traveler who asked whether the sand in egypt would affect her asthma
eight
panicked callers regularly reporting australian travelers missing overseas after not hearing from them within the first few hours of arriving in country
consular officers usually explain that getting through customs and immigration can take time
nine
why won't the australian embassy come and pack my bags for me 
i'm an eighty year old traveling by myself and too old to pack my own bags
ten
i left some items on an aircraft when i changed flights
can the embassy collect it from the airline's lost property 
eleven
can the embassy obtain prescription medicine from australia and send it to me so i can continue my holiday 
twelve
requests for our embassies to store luggage hold mail provide banking facilities or arrange tours for australian travelers
thirteen

fourteen
i'm going on a cruise
what will the food be like

hong kong the main site of hong kong's pro democracy protests was taken apart piece by piece thursday ushering in the end of an extraordinary occupation that deepened political fault lines over china's role in the city's government
down came the rows of colorful tents that had populated a stretch of highway running through the heart of the city's financial district
down came the works of protest art that had sprung up during the occupation including the movement's emblematic umbrella sculptures
police dragged out the last remaining demonstrators one by one and by nine forty five p.m. had cleared them all
both lanes of harcourt road which has been occupied for weeks were open and traffic was back to normal within two hours
police finished clearing the area in the span of a day
a small protest site remained in causeway bay not far from the harcourt road area but police warned protesters that if they moved to that area arrests would be made
the clearance of the site heralded the end of more than ten weeks of street demonstrations that challenged china's communist ruled government and captured the world's attention
the protests blocked off parts of the city for weeks led to sporadic clashes and appeared to serve as a political awakening for many young hong kong citizens
after bailiffs dismantled barricades at the site following a court injunction requested by a bus company waves of police officers moved in
they met little resistance as they yanked down tents and used box cutters and chainsaws to cut through improvised barriers of metal wood and plastic
bailiffs carried off broken umbrellas that had also formed part of the barricades wilted versions of the protest movement's emblem
the protest site next to the city's government headquarters had once drawn tens of thousands of people
but on thursday only a few hundred remained
many people had packed up and left before the deadline set by authorities
if it's a test of force there's no possibility that we can win said jamie ng a twenty one year old protester who vowed to stay until the end
the chinese government which has ultimate control over hong kong has steadfastly rejected the protesters demand for open elections in the territory calling the street occupation illegal and letting local authorities deal with the situation on the ground
in recent weeks divisions have deepened among different groups within the protest movement numbers have thinned and public support for the street occupations has fallen away
but demonstrators have said that even after the protest site is cleared they will continue their campaign
we will be back read some signs around the site before the clearance started
it's just the beginning warned another
we'll do more civil disobedience actions
we'll go talk to local communities ng said
leaders of the student groups that have spearheaded the demonstrations said they would remain at the main protest site but wouldn't physically resist the police
about one hundred and fifty to two hundred people including politicians and students sat on the road of the main site thursday saying they were ready to be arrested
after giving the group a final warning police began escorting the protesters one by one to vans parked nearby carrying those people who wouldn't walk
i want real democracy i want universal suffrage one demonstrator chanted as they hauled him away
alex chow secretary general of the hong kong federation of students said that members of the organization would stay on the front lines but wouldn't use violence
clearing out the protest area doesn't solve the underlying problem he said addressing the crowd before authorities moved in
joshua wong the student figure who has become the face of the protest movement has also urged protesters to remain peaceful
wong a leader of the student group scholarism abandoned a hunger strike over the weekend that was aimed at getting the hong kong government to hold talks with protesters
the day before the clearance a twenty four year old protester jerry lam told cnn that he thought the occupation's legacy would live on
before the umbrella movement hong kong people didn't really pay attention to politics
but now everyone cares he said
our generation will pass this story on to the next generation and they'll know what we did

days after the world of athletics was hit by serious doping allegations the sport has been accused of covering up how it dealt with scores of suspicious blood samples
in the two years between two thousand and six and two thousand and eight the body in charge of global athletics failed to examine as many as one hundred and fifty samples from several countries according to a report broadcast by a german network monday
this was a period before widespread changes were introduced to anti doping procedures
the allegations reported by german tv station wdr came less than a week after german broadcaster zdf ard aired an hour long programme documenting russia's alleged endemic use of banned substances
as with last week's documentary wdr released an english transcript after airing the report
the international association of athletics federations is now investigating those claims but the governing body now finds itself under the microscope
during monday's edition of the sport inside a former member of the iaaf's medical commission who is not identified said the samples in question were from athletes representing spain kenya greece germany morocco russia and at least one from britain
just take a look the haemoglobin values how they have risen in only four months by thirty eight percents and in the next four months they have fallen again by sixteen percents the official explains according to the english translation of the documentary provided by the broadcaster to cnn
it's obvious that there's something wrong there
that simply can not be
it is absolutely clear to see and physiologically simply can not be explained
this can only be doping
president of spain's athletics federation jose maria odriozola said his organization received no notification of any suspicious samples from the iaaf
when we receive information of that type we immediately carry out surprise doping tests on the suspicious athletes odriozola said in an email sent to cnn
he also outlined that spanish track athletes are required to supply their blood passport a method used to monitor any potential doping violations a week before competition
both british athletics and uk anti doping have declined to comment while both the russian athletics federation and russian anti doping agency have so far failed to reply to cnn's request for comment
the iaaf insisted tuesday that the english transcript of the documentary would be passed on directly to its independent ethics commission
it also said that a member of the iaaf medical and anti doping commission would not know whether follow up tests would have been conducted or not
the athlete biological passport program was launched in two thousand and nine ensuring athlete's blood samples were stored electronically and monitored over time according to the iaaf
samples collected prior to two thousand and nine according to the iaaf do not have the same level of reliability and strength as the post two thousand and nine values which were collected under strict and stringent conditions
the governing body also stated that any samples taken before two thousand and nine were only used as secondary evidence or to arrange trigger follow up urine tests
the iaaf also insists that abnormal results were duly followed up by the iaaf whenever possible logistically
wada the world's anti doping agency said it would investigate the allegations in a statement released on tuesday
last week's das erste documentary had already alleged systematic doping in russian athletics
it claimed russian officials covered up positive results in exchange for financial reward
the russian anti doping agency announced it would investigate the allegations while the president of the country's athletics federation told reuters the claims were a pack of lies

paton walsh described his experiences including meeting a group of children who played in a makeshift graveyard and hid under cushions to protect themselves from isis shelling in an ask me anything chat on reddit
here are the highlights from the hourlong conversation
some of the posts have been edited for grammar and clarity
i'm sure you saw and experienced a lot of devastating things in your time over there
what was the most heartbreaking thing you saw 
do you think outside foreign involvement over there is having more of a positive or negative impact on the people 
asked smedynski
paton walsh
the kids in their cushion shelter is always tough
i also remember a bomb shelter some kids made two years ago now in a refugee camp in bab al salama
they were literally digging a cave with their hands
foreign help comes in many forms
isis have some foreigners
the turkish are just across the border but the kurds claim they are impeding resupply
the iraqi kurdish peshmerga help a lot with heavy weapons
and the coalition airstrikes also keep isis back and have helped the kurds hang on
but in the end the sheer volume of outside parties now with stakes in the fight for the town means that it will go on a long time
hi nick amazing report from kobani how long were you there and how did you get in 
asked suzannelavery
paton walsh
thanks
we were there just under forty eight hours
i can't really say much about how we got in it was a mix of simple and complicated but we are grateful to the kurds for their hospitality and care
what's the current situation for journalists there 
interested to know about how you get your stories out how you manage the day to day 
asked ithinkandroid
thank you in advance
paton walsh
it is complicated
anyone attempting entry should spend weeks thinking about it and not file until out
day to day you need the full invitation and hospitality of the kurds to operate in any way
did you feel safe under the kurds care and hospitality 
asked monhen
paton walsh
yes as safe as one can there
you probably aren't allowed to answer this but i'll ask anyways
how does your personal understanding and experience being there seeing things and working there differ from what is ultimately reported 
perhaps it doesn't 
or maybe it does 
in either case i am curious to hear your thoughts
and thanks for taking the time to do this ama
asked rurd
paton walsh
it's the same
there isn't some process by which we see and feel a lot of things that we then ignore and follow a preordained script
you see what we do
i know that's hard to believe in this social media age of micro digestion but it's true
did you interview any isis members 
asked shouldbeworking twenty three
paton walsh
the nature of isis means that in person you are unlikely or ill advised to interview them
social media interaction and skype are possible and my colleagues have managed that
the kurds did not have any isis prisoners at the time we were inside kobani
thank you and your team for being professionals and risking your lives for the story
did you meet any foreign nationals fighting for the kurdish side 
is there any truth to the reports of isis getting resupplied from the turkish side of the border 
how effective do you think are the allied airstrikes on isis 
and last but not least have you ever touched wolf blitzer's beard 
again thank you
paton walsh
no no foreign nationals
we were told there may be some but saw none
isis are not as far as we can see getting any resupply the turkish are in a bind as they are both presumably trying to not end up in an open fight with isis whilst securing their own borders
the coalition airstrikes are being effective in terms of denying isis the chance to take all of kobani
the strikes have also meant isis have had to pour in and lose fighters and equipment
they can't finish the fight off though
that will take better equipping for the kurds
hey nick
what do you see as the best solution for the situation in syria right now 
any ideas how to remove assad from power 
asked ceclimber twenty two
paton walsh
you can't tackle isis without also addressing the reason why such extremism has a constituency the three years of massacres of sunnis that assad forces perpetrated
but an overall solution for syria is outside of the resources the u.s. wants to commit at this point
there are also too many other players who want an opposite outcome iran russia
the u.s. should be and perhaps has been mindful that their increased presence like ground troops has often become the lightning rod for all anger adding a new problem rather than fixing the original one
in end syria is going to be a conflict that tires of itself
one key problem is that this war has become a proxy conflict for many sides and keeps expanding dragging in iraq and more different militias
so the point in which the combatants get exhausted keeps staying out of reach
it will take a singular seismic event that prompts serious international action or more likely eventual exhaustion to stop this war
what are your thoughts on the cia isis torture videos released yesterday 
do you think the videos will provoke isis to expedite their attacks on u.s. soil 
also from your perspective how concerned should we be in regards to isis growth 
the news reports they're growing rapidly was this evident during your time in syria 
paton walsh
isis grew most rapidly when they were not on the global radar and then when they ran into iraq taking mosul
since then their victories have been incremental
they haven't had the huge storming win they need for recruitment the constant forward motion that many analysts say makes them attractive to future recruits
they are growing in terms of infrastructure and organization perhaps but not geographical reach if you exclude a handful of pledges of allegiance in other countries that are symbolically worrying but not game changers
does isis isil actually consider the term daesh as offensive 
i have only seen the one report by residents in mosul saying that the fighters and leadership see it as offensive
will renaming them across all fronts actually do anything 
thanks
paton walsh

monaco's princess gabriella therese marie was born at five four p.m. wednesday beating her brother jacques honore rainier into the waking world by two minutes the royal family announced on facebook
the twins are the first children born to charlene wittstock the former south african olympic swimmer who married prince albert ii in two thousand and eleven
their birth took place at the princess grace hospital monaco named after albert's mother and late legendary hollywood actress grace kelly
the princess and the children are doing well the royal family said
prince albert hadn't been married before but he did have two children born out of wedlock in one thousand nine hundred and ninety two and two thousand and three
yet it's the twins born to wittstock who will get first crack at the throne because monaco law dictates that succession passes upon death or abdication to the direct legitimate of the previous prince
and in this case it would be albert's son jacques even though he arrived after his sister
while gabriella will be the second child in the line of succession according to the royal family jacques is the crown prince and receives the title of marquis of baux
princess gabriella is now known as the countess of carlades

a suicide attack outside a military base in samarra north of baghdad killed nine people and wounded fifteen others wednesday security officials said
iraqi soldiers were among the dead and wounded according to the officials who blamed the truck bombing on isis
samarra is about one hundred kilometers north of baghdad

that was two years ago after the world's youngest country split from its northern nemesis sudan
i remember the look on people's faces bucciarelli said
tired but happy hopeful for a better future after a past full of pain and war
his return in february was anything but
this time bucciarelli found a nation on the brink of an abyss
instead of jubilant faces of hope he saw defeated faces haunted by a return of ghosts of past wars
months of ethnic violence had left thousands dead one point five million people displaced and a looming famine according to the united nations
bucciarelli found despair cramped in tent camps growing sexual violence and the recruitment of child soldiers
he described the violence in south sudan as an invisible conflict
it represents one of the longest and most forgotten african wars he said
its apparent stillness leads to hear about it less and less
given the tragic consequences and repercussions on the population i find it essential to bring it to light
his goal he said is to tell the stories of people rendered powerless by wars provide objective images and shed light on human rights issues
it's hard to find front line war photography of the kind we've seen in libya or syria bucciarelli said
the images in south sudan are different
they describe visually the effect of the impending war lending you a view of the civilian and military populations and providing a glimpse of life inside a murky not clearly defined conflict
the latest conflict erupted in december last year when president salva kiir accused his fired deputy riek machar of an attempted coup
since then militia loyal to both have battled each other and targeted civilians from rival tribes
the conflict has wiped out entire neighborhoods and transformed into a full blown war between two large tribes the nuer and the dinka
machar belongs to the nuer community while the president is a dinka
south sudan's war represents one of the longest and most forgotten african conflicts he said
its tragic consequences are quietly fading away from the headlines making these pictures even more crucial
south sudan split from sudan in two thousand and eleven as part of a peace deal that ended decades of war in africa's largest nation
that war left two million people dead and ended with the peace agreement that included an independence referendum for the south
the recent clashes have been a major setback for a country so desperate for a new start
instead of relishing its independence residents of areas such as bentiu bor nyang and mingkaman are struggling to survive as communities turn against one another
concerned neighboring nations have stepped in and urged warring parties to sign ceasefire deals but the weapons have not gone quiet
frantic international pleas for peace have gone unheeded

a senior palestinian authority official died wednesday after a confrontation with israeli troops prompting president mahmoud abbas to halt security coordination with israel according to palestinian officials
ziyad abu ein died after clashes with israeli soldiers midday wednesday in the palestinian village of turmusaya which is northeast of the west bank city of ramallah longtime chief palestinian negotiator saeb erakat said in a statement
abu ein a minister in abbas fatah party and head of the committee to resist the wall and settlements was there participating in nonviolent demonstrations to mark international human rights day according to erakat's statement
there were varying reports of exactly how abu ein died including what role if any israeli authorities played in it
pictures from various news agencies depict an israeli soldier with his hands to abu ein's neck followed by another showing him on the ground
the official palestinian news agency wafa meanwhile reported that the palestinian official lost consciousness after he inhaled tear gas and an israeli soldier hit him in the chest
the israeli soldiers called abu ein by name and seemed to be focused on him witness kamal abu safaka told cnn
there was a lot of pushing kicking and punching by the soldiers

when abu ein tried to intercede they hit him on the chest with a rifle butt and grabbed him by the throat and pushed him back and then threw a large amount of tear gas and stun grenades
dr. ahmed bitawi the director of the ramallah hospital that inspected abu ein's body said he died from asphyxiation after choking on vomit brought on by tear gas inhalation
but a preliminary autopsy report released by the israeli government indicated that abu ein's death was caused by a blockage of the coronary artery due to hemorrhaging
the bleeding could have been caused by stress the report said suggesting the poor condition of abu ein's heart caused him to be more sensitive to stress
israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu sent a message via his special envoy yitzhak molcho to palestinian authority officials telling them that israel will investigate the death according to a government statement
the prime minister who has been holding security consultations throughout the day pointed to the need to calm the situation and act responsibly the statement said
the israeli military said in a statement that the incident happened after its forces halted the progress of rioters into the civilian community of abed ad using riot dispersal means
the idf is reviewing the circumstances of the participation of ziyad abu ein and his later death the israeli military said noting an israeli pathologist will join a group of pathologists from jordan for an examination

additionally a proposal has been made to the palestinians to establish a joint investigation team to review the incident
jordanian minister of information mohammed al momani said that two forensic doctors were sent to the west bank to help in determining the cause of death in response to a palestinian request
declaring three days of mourning abbas slammed abu ein's death as an intolerable barbaric act according to wafa
what happened is a crime by all means we can not sit idle and silent this crime he said later on palestinian television
for that this leadership is meeting now to decide what it wants and i say honestly all options are open for discussion and for implementation

we don't have any other solutions
hanan ashrawi an executive member of the palestine liberation organization said abbas also froze security coordination with israel
jibril rajoub a member of fatah's central committee confirmed this development
a meeting of plo representatives wednesday night about the day's development's was heated ashrawi said
one of the options discussed at the session was taking the palestinian case to the u.n. security council
there will be another meeting friday
ashrawi is among the palestinians outraged by the minister's death demanding an international and impartial investigation
this is a deliberate and willful act of murder and criminality she said

in the space of six weeks with great displays of importance india's capital will have hosted two world leaders who no longer speak with each other
the presidents of russia and the united states
india sits uncomfortably between these two adversaries
pick your geopolitical topic syria iran ukraine and you can be sure that moscow and washington will be at odds with each other
new delhi has been watching from afar sitting on the fence
it is fair to ask if india's stance is sustainable
can you simultaneously court close friendships with two states whose foreign policies are designed to hurt the other

the man of the millennium 
in narendra modis worldview the answer is a resounding yes
when cnn spoke with the indian prime minister earlier this year in his only interview since assuming office modi explained how he saw a changed world order
if you look closely you will see that every country is trying to build relations with other countries he said
they may be part of one bloc but they also sit with fierce opponents
when pushed specifically on russia's annexation of crimea a hostile takeover new delhi refused to condemn modi pushed right back
in the world right now a lot of people want to give advice
but look within them and they too have sinned in some way
the comment could be seen as a subtle dig at washington's foreign policy missteps
however modi's point was not to admonish the u.s. but to suggest that all nations have their own value systems and perceived flaws
indias way of navigating flawed global players was by making friendships and opening channels of opportunity
read
opinion
why modi visit crucial for u.s. india world
the subtext to this is simple
economics
the reason why modi has traveled all over the world in his first few months in office rio new york tokyo sydney is not because he wants to be a foreign policy leader
modi wants to bring business to india
so
as you read about and see images of vladimir putins grand reception in new delhi this week keep an eye not on the rhetoric but the outcomes and deals struck
russia is the world's second largest exporter of arms
india is the world's biggest importer
russia is one of the world's biggest producers of oil and gas
india is one of the biggest consumers
the two sustain each others needs
and as long as they do they will court each other with the united states watching on

more than two months of pro democracy protests that transformed the heart of hong kong's financial district could be coming to an abrupt end this week
police have announced that they plan thursday to clear the main protest camp which sprawls along a multi lane highway next to the city's government headquarters
protest leaders say they don't intend to put up a fight but it remains unclear if other factions in the decentralized movement will resist the police action
public support for the student led protests swelled in late september after police used tear gas and other tough tactics in a botched attempt to disperse demonstrators
the umbrella movement as the demonstrations became known made headlines around the world prompting speculation about how the chinese government which has ultimate control over hong kong would react
the protesters have held onto a big stretch of highway in the city's admiralty district since then populating it with rows of colorful tents outdoor classrooms and art installations
but while support remains for the demonstrators cause a call for hong kong to be able to choose its next leader from an open field of candidates enthusiasm for their methods has faded
in a poll in november just thirteen percents of hong kongers surveyed said the street occupations should continue
divisions deepened between different groups of demonstrators last week after a failed attempt to surround the government headquarters led to clashes with police
the chinese government has steadfastly rejected the protesters demands calling the movement illegal and letting hong kong authorities deal with the situation on the ground
police and bailiffs to move in
police are now taking advantage of a court injunction requested by a bus company that orders the clearing of some of the highways blocked by the protest camp
the illegal road occupations have lasted for more than two months and the daily lives and livelihoods of the general public have been seriously affected assistant police commissioner cheung tak keung said tuesday
he said police would on thursday assist bailiffs in clearing the areas covered by the court order and would then move to reopen the other blocked roads
they will also remove the much smaller protest camp in the shopping district of causeway bay at an appropriate time he said
the police plan appears to spell the end of the street protests
authorities dismantled the other key encampment in the working class district of mong kok last month
the end of this phase 
leaders of the student groups that have spearheaded the demonstrations said they would remain at the admiralty protest site but wouldn't physically resist the police
we will sit outside the injunction area
we will stay true to the spirit of civil disobedience remain peaceful and bear the legal consequences of our action said alex chow secretary general of the hong kong federation of students
their final sit in would mark the end of this phase of the occupation chow said tuesday according to the south china morning post a local newspaper
joshua wong the student figure who has become the face of the protest movement has also urged protesters to remain peaceful
wong a leader of the student group scholarism abandoned a hunger strike at the weekend that was aimed at getting the hong kong government to hold talks with protesters
i'll let them arrest me 
one protester at the site jerry lam said wednesday that he planned to stay there until the police came
i'll let them arrest me if it comes to that and i think everyone here in this camp feels the same lam twenty four told cnn as he folded up his tent
but another demonstrator gypsy wong twenty two said she was packing up and wouldn't be there when the police came
even if we resist there's no use she told cnn remembering a night of clashes she witnessed earlier in the movement
i felt so helpless when the police were charging down upon us she said
that night i cried and i don't want to see that again
lam said that whatever happened the clearance of the protest camp wouldn't erase the people's spirit
before the umbrella movement hong kong people didn't really pay attention to politics
but now everyone cares he said
our generation will pass this story onto the next generation and they'll know what we did

police in birmingham england received a credible anonymous threat against officers monday and took steps last night to ensure the safety of our officers and staff the west midlands police force said tuesday
it was anonymous but credible information suggesting police officers could be subjected to attacks west midlands police assistant chief constable garry forsyth said
we acted swiftly to relay details to officers and remind them over the importance to remain vigilant
the force would not comment on bbc reports that the threat was to kidnap and kill a police officer
forsyth said that some staff were held on duty at the end of their shifts while they were given additional security guidance but that at no time were officers pulled off the streets
the guidance given included advice about traveling to and from work in uniform he said as well as on the security of police stations
our commitment is to protect the public from harm and though we take all security issues seriously we will not be distracted from that promise he said

seven decades after being sent to nazi concentration camps survivors of the holocaust will have the chance to get retribution from the government of france
france signed an agreement monday with u.s. authorities to pay sixty million dollar to holocaust survivors transported to concentration camps said arnaud guillois a spokesman for the french embassy in washington
patrizianna sparacino thiellay france's ambassador at large for human rights in charge of holocaust issues said monday the agreement is a further contribution to recognizing france's commitment to facing up to its historic responsibilities
the reparation programs set up immediately after the war and those introduced in the past fifteen years are the tangible symbol of the official acknowledgment in one thousand nine hundred and ninety five of france's imprescriptible debt towards the victims of the holocaust sparacino thiellay said
a joint statement from france's foreign affairs ministry and the u.s. state department noted that the accord shows the close relationship between the two countries
in this year marked by the commemoration of the seventy th anniversary of the allied landings in normandy and provence this agreement further strengthens the historic friendship and ties between our two countries the statement said
u.s. officials created the fund and will administer it
but americans aren't the only ones eligible for compensation
victims living in nations that haven't signed holocaust compensation agreements also can benefit according to the embassy spokesman
a few thousand people may be eligible for some of the fund according to guillois
this fund had been years in the making and had come under intense pressure inside the united states including efforts by american lawmakers to bar the sncf the french national railway from bidding in u.s. markets until the issue is resolved
one piece of proposed legislation the holocaust rail justice act stated that more than seventy five thousand jews and thousands of others were moved from france to nazi concentration camps on sncf trains
those transported included u.s. citizens and their relatives as well as american military pilots shot down during the war
an official at france's national railway declined to comment on the agreement when reached by cnn
yet guillois explained that the sncf was not considered liable for the deportation of jews in france because it was commissioned by france's vichy government which was formed after the armistice and collaborated with the nazis to do so
this isn't the first time that france which was invaded by nazi germany in one thousand nine hundred and forty before reaching an armistice agreement with adolf hitler's government later that year has borne some responsibility for the holocaust
as guillois noted this latest agreement is one of several mechanisms by the french government to compensate holocaust victims since one thousand nine hundred and forty six the year after world war ii ended
the nazis systematically killed more than six million jews during the holocaust along with millions of other people who were religious and ethnic minorities political dissidents homosexuals or disabled in death camps situated primarily in germany and eastern europe

a spanish judge on tuesday temporarily banned cell phone based taxi service uber from operating in spain after a complaint brought by taxi drivers in the capital madrid
the judge issued the ban the equivalent of a temporary injunction on the grounds that uber was deemed to be causing damage to the taxi industry a court spokesman said
the hearing was in response to a complaint by the madrid taxi association which argued that uber is unfair competition and also lacks the proper municipal licenses to operate a taxi service
the madrid taxi association is expected now to file a formal lawsuit with the court after gathering more documents and information the court spokesman said
legal arguments for uber were not heard before the judge because the company is located outside of spain in the u.s. state of delaware and the taxi industry was seeking immediate relief he said
the company is expected to have a chance to argue its points before the judge when the formal lawsuit is filed
the madrid ruling comes on the same day that india's federal government warned states against allowing unlicensed web based taxi services after an uber driver was accused of raping a woman in new delhi
transport authorities in new delhi on monday announced a ban on uber services in the indian capital saying their investigation revealed the company was violating permit rules

in a country where bleaching creams are frequently used to chemically lighten skin tone one savvy entrepreneur is fighting against the disfiguring practice
after nineteen years of driving taxis alhaji mustapha oti boateng was looking for a change
his journey for a new profession led him to britain japan and ultimately back home to ghana where he stumbled into his calling after producing a line of herbal cosmetics
in ghana the practice of using creams and other cosmetic products to chemically lighten skin tone is fairly common as it is in many african countries but the practice is known to have detrimental health effects according to the world health organization
using his deep rooted knowlege of herbs boateng had an idea to help his fellow ghanaians
now a household name in the west african region his chocho cosmetics has become a popular staple in beauty bags throughout the area
boateng who won the overall entrepreneur of the year award bestowed by the entrepreneurs foundation of ghana earlier this year sat down with cnn to explain how he went from a humble taxi driver to a cosmetics king
cnn
what was your breakout product 
alhaji mustapha oti boateng
i started with chocho cream the natural skin restorer and beauty soap
it is a local soap produced by our forefathers
it's not all types of a disease that a cream can cure but most of the skin ailments the cream can cure
that is why it's written as a natural skin restorer it doesn't bleach but rather enhances your color
cnn
where has this knowledge of organic cosmetics come from 
ab
my father was a herbalist and my grandfather was a herbalist i tried to recall all those things that when i was young they sent me to the bush to collect
the herbs that we have here have a real potency of curing
and when i started using them too i have realized that i didn't choose the wrong way of curing people
cnn
you had been working as a taxi driver since you dropped out of school
why the sudden need to mix things up 
ab
when i found that my children were growing up i told one of my taxi clients that i had to find something to do so that i would be able to look after my children very well
and he himself told me they needed to send someone to britain to go and learn how to operate printing a press
he sent me there i learned and came back and they opened a printing press for me in accra
cnn
then after the printing press came a stint in japan
ab
they gave me the opportunity to go and i traveled to japan where i started odd jobs
i came back with about five buses and started a transport business but unfortunately for me it was all accidents one after the other
cnn
after all these accidents you didn't give up though
you transformed one of the buses into a mobile grocery delivery service right 
ab
what i was doing was going to the villages buying food stuffs buying everything needed in the kitchen and coming to the residential areas and announcing the things that i had to sell
it was a very lucrative job
i did it for some time and i saw that the work was so tedious because sometimes i had to go to the bush myself carry the load uproot the coco yam cassava and that stuff by myself and age was catching up with me
so i decided that this work i can't do it for long because if age caught up with me i can't go to the bush to carry those food stuffs so i decided to try another thing
cnn
so where did the name chocho come from 
ab
this name chocho is in the memory of a dear friend who has passed on
that name chocho was a nickname between us
cnn
and how did you know organic skin care products would take off the way they did 
ab
i went to the market and bought creams that are manufactured and produced by foreign countries powders and perfumes and went around announcing those things for sale and it was really doing very well
cnn
so you decided to start producing locally and it's been quite the success
has it been an easy ride 
ab
the economy is always fluctuating
you know we haven't got a permanent exchange rate for our currency
i'm an herbalist i produce other products but some things fragrance and petroleum jelly and that sort of stuff
we import them so at the time of importation you calculate based on the exchange rate before the goods would arrive in the country sometimes the exchange rate would shoot upwards
cnn
you seem to face these obstacles head on and industry leaders have noticed
how did it feel to be honored as the overall entrepreneur of the year in april 
ab
as somebody who started from nowhere if i am in this area and being recognized that i am the entrepreneur of the year obviously i cherish this the most
it means they are appreciating what i am doing so i was very happy
cnn
and after receiving these honors you're also trying the pay it forward mentality by helping build schools and provide computers in classrooms 
ab
i'm not educated but i'm always happy when i see children in school
you know here in africa it's not all people who get the opportunity to go to school
education is a lost treasure for every human being
that is why i'm always passionate even if i did not get the change to educate myself very well
now that allah has given me that power everywhere that i see that need for education if it is in my power i help them
cnn
last question what advice do you have for any budding businessmen 
ab
nobody should think that because they didn't go to a classroom to sit on a chair i'm not educated
we can always educate ourselves wherever we go
that is a courageous way of life
whatever dreams that we have we should think that it's human beings who can do anything in this world
opinion
diaspora should have a voice too

new york britain's prince william and kate left flowers at one of the reflecting pools during their visit to the nine eleven memorial and museum tuesday morning both pausing to reflect as somber skies and pouring rain marked the occasion
a handwritten note placed with the flowers read
in sorrowful memory of those who died on eleven th september and in admiration of the courage shown to rebuild
william and catherine
their visit to the memorial was the first stop on the royal couple's jam packed third and final day in new york city
the duke and duchess spent roughly thirty minutes inside the museum remarking on the survivors staircase that was salvaged from the tower ruins
they had lots of questions and interest in how these stairs were used by hundreds of people on that day to escape said joe daniels the museum's president
both also visited the in memoriam exhibition which holds profiles of nine eleven victims and a wall that bears two thousand nine hundred and eighty three blue tiles one for each of the victims of the attacks in new york the pentagon and the pennsylvania site where a hijacked plane crashed plus the victims of the one thousand nine hundred and ninety three world trade center bombing
before leaving the museum kate and william both signed an interactive electronic tablet writing catherine and william in script which projected their signatures on a sixty foot wall in the museum's foundation hall
it was a tremendous visit and you could see in really both of their eyes the sort of care and curiosity they had for the story of what happened and the people who died that day said daniels
the museum was open to the public during their visit though other museumgoers were kept at a distance
echoing the excited crowds that greeted the pair at their arrival at the carlyle hotel sunday evening a dozen or so visitors awaited the couple's arrival in the museum lobby ready with their camera phones
mary failes of virginia beach virginia was one of them
a longtime royal watcher who held a baby shower for kate and hosted a viewing of prince charles and the late princess diana's one thousand nine hundred and eighty one wedding at her home had long planned to visit the nine eleven museum and just happened to be there the same day as william and kate
it was just a coincidence meant to be
failes said
the pair later then made their way to an event hosted by the door and the citykids foundation both arts education and youth development centers for disadvantaged youths in the west village neighborhood of manhattan
the two were treated to a dance storytelling and musical performance by people involved with both centers
william was seen tapping his feet to music that accompanied a hip hop dance show
one performance by steven prescod which told the story of how his father was incarcerated and how he faced his own possible jail term impressed william so much that he offered to help bring the story to a mainstream audience
william said he wanted to help me put this together
he gave me his contact number and said to reach out to him said prescod twenty two of brooklyn
he said the duke and duchess visit brought hope
after the show william he congratulated the group
that was incredible guys
it was amazing and should be on in the west end referring to an area in london where several professional theaters are located
it nearly had me in tears he admitted
following their visit william and kate attended a lunch reception at the neuehouse celebrating the british talent in creative industries based in new york
guests in attendance included film producer harvey weinstein actor sir patrick stewart j.crew president jenna lyons actress archie panjabi and downton abbey producer gareth neame
william also paid a visit the empire state building tuesday afternoon accompanied by mayor bill de blasio
the day's earlier heavy rain subsided and william walked the entire perimeter of the observation deck of the famous eighty six story landmark stopping to point out other landmarks and sights
red white and blue lights had been adorning the top of the building in honor of the royal visit
on tuesday night the duke and duchess attended a benefit dinner celebrating the six hundred th anniversary of the university of st. andrews in scotland held at the metropolitan museum of art
crowds of onlookers lined up three deep to watch the couple exit their car on the corner of eighty two nd street and fifth avenue
after the royal pair ascended the steps to the museum they were greeted by a group of eight recent st. andrews alumni who were dressed in the traditional red robes worn at the college
kate made a gesture suggesting she remembered the robes from her time at school
kate wore a jenny packham dress that she has worn to several other galas before
william wore a classic black tuxedo
william and kate arrived in new york city sunday evening for their three day trip their first visit to the big apple
reporting from new york monday morning cnn royal correspondent max foster said kate was the star of the show
screams greeted the duchess of cambridge when she arrived at a children's craft group in harlem greeted by the first lady of new york city chirlane mccray amid tight security
meanwhile william jetted down to washington for a quick visit with president obama at the white house
the visit underscored the special relationship between the united states and the united kingdom the white house said
after speaking at a session of the world bank about the need for an international effort to stop illegal wildlife trading william jetted back to nyc on a flight whose passengers also included cnn's anderson cooper
the duke and duchess of cambridge also chatted with hillary and chelsea clinton at a royal foundation reception monday evening and even met jay z beyonce and king james also known as basketball star lebron james at a basketball game at the barclays center in brooklyn
they also got a look at american style protest as demonstrators marched outside barclays center in brooklyn to show their anger about the lack of an indictment in the eric garner chokehold death

the coast guard didn't think ron ingraham could survive stuck in a twenty five foot sailboat for days as waves swelled fifteen to twenty feet high
his son did
i don't feel like he's dead zakary ingraham told a coast guard official nine days ago after learning their search was ending
i don't feel it
he was right
ron ingraham was picked up tuesday morning about sixty four miles south of honolulu weak hungry and dehydrated and most importantly alive
his rescue came twelve days after he made his first distress call a difficult stretch even for a veteran fisherman
but he wasn't beaten up enough to lose his priorities
according to his son the sixty seven year old ron ingraham told his rescuers we ain't leaving without my boat
so the sailor and his boat headed back to shore wednesday
what will his dad do now that he's back on land 
will he relax take some time off maybe look for a less dangerous profession 
i'm sure he's going to go fishing as soon as he's able zakary ingraham said by phone from missouri
like tomorrow
some people in their late sixty s might be enjoying retirement or at least reining it in a few notches as life slows down
not ron ingraham whose son describes him as resourceful physically strong and tough
you know who rambo is 
zakary ingraham joked
rambo has a picture of my dad on his wall
fishing is his life and livelihood
ron ingraham lives on his boat and that's pretty much all he's got his son said explaining his insistence his battered vessel which he named malia be towed back to shore
he set off solo around thanksgiving from molokai on what should have been a normal trip like many others he'd made over the years
it didn't turn out that way
he made distress calls on the holiday indicating his boat was taking on water
those calls spurred a search that would end up covering twelve thousand square miles
it included an mh sixty five helicopter an hc one hundred and thirty airplane and the one hundred and ten foot coast guard cutter kiska
but none of them could find ron ingraham or his boat
on december one the coast guard called off its search
zakary ingraham said he was told that airplanes but not satellites picked up his father's emergency beacon suggesting it either had a weak battery or his boat was submerged
with rocky seas the weather wasn't cooperating either
with the conditions the way they are we couldn't find your dad's boat zakary ingraham recalled a coast guard official telling him
we think it's sunk
in fact ron ingraham's boat was still afloat
and on tuesday he decided to give the distress call one more try
his life depended on it
this is a mayday mayday mayday said ingraham

small boat in danger of sinking
the u.s. coast guard heard the call and immediately dispatched the closest available boat the uss paul hamilton a u.s. navy destroyer then about fourteen miles away
they found ingraham's masts broken and him using an auxiliary sail trying to get closer to land his friend and fellow fisherman dedrick manaba told cnn affiliate hawaii news now
and of course there was ingraham himself weary and battered but still going much to the relief of his friends and family
i was going backwards all night long 
it all started ron ingraham said when a simple plan to get food and water before dark one night went awry after the weather took a turn for the worse
i tried all through the night

i couldn't make it
i was going backwards all night long he told cnn affiliate khnl kgmb after his rescue
at one point a massive wave crashed into his sailboat
the boat mast hit the water ingraham said and so did he
but i had a rope on me towed myself back in ingraham said
from there he had no choice but to go where the current took him
searchers had struggled to find him because weather pulled him hundreds of miles away from the area where they'd been looking he said
i was way out there and i was out of water but i hydrated on fish he said
i'm a fisherman so i caught fish
it wasn't as a good as a sushi bar he said
but it was how he survived
he's alive after twelve days at sea his son zakary ingraham said
i couldn't be happier

foday gallah saw the sick child was distressed and felt he had to do something
so he picked the kid up to comfort him
and with that act of kindness the thirty seven year old ambulance supervisor in monrovia liberia contracted ebola himself
of course he got vomit all over him and that's how he got ebola said photographer jackie nickerson who shot gallah's image for time's person of the year magazine cover which honors those on the front line of the ebola epidemic
they're the ones who answered the call the magazine said on its website wednesday morning
nickerson expanded on why gallah was chosen for one of the magazine's five covers
he's the shining example of what the right thing to do is
he's a shining example that we should all try to follow
he really did touch me with his story
i don't usually like to use the word hero but i have to use it here
according to the latest world health organization figures about six thousand three hundred people have died from the disease mainly in west africa
health workers are still battling more than eleven thousand confirmed cases in guinea liberia and sierra leone and more than six thousand suspected and probable cases loom according to who
though those countries mark the epicenter of the outbreak isolated cases have spread wider penetrating other african countries europe and even the united states
time magazine's editors decided to honor the unprecedented numbers of doctors and nurses who responded when ebola overtook an already weak public health infrastructure and time editor nancy gibbs outlined how governments were ill equipped to respond who was in denial and snarled in red tape and first responders were accused of crying wolf as the disease spread
yet many doctors and nurses especially those from doctors without borders and samaritan's purse responded and worked alongside local physicians nurses ambulance drivers and burial teams gibbs wrote
some were driven by god while others did it for country and some simply had the instinct to run into the fire not away she wrote
ebola is a war and a warning
the global health system is nowhere close to strong enough to keep us safe from infectious disease and us means everyone not just those in faraway places where this is one threat among many that claim lives every day wrote gibbs
she continued the rest of the world can sleep at night because a group of men and women are willing to stand and fight
for tireless acts of courage and mercy for buying the world time to boost its defenses for risking for persisting for sacrificing and saving the ebola fighters are time's two thousand and fourteen person of the year
in addition to gallah the ambulance driver time highlighted on its cover four other ebola fighters who worked on the ground in west africa
dr. jerry brown is a liberian surgeon who converted his hospital's chapel into one of the country's first treatment centers
the center's reception area where brown gets dressed is a bare room lit by a single bulb nickerson the photographer said
salome karwah is an ebola survivor who lost both parents to the disease and undertook the task of counseling patients in liberia
nickerson recalled how the doctors without borders caregiver appeared to be a typical young woman dressed nicely and a little nervous about being photographed
but then she put on her scrubs

she became very calm a little bit introverted the photographer said
ella watson stryker is a doctors without borders health promoter who has been in west africa since march
the american was uneasy during the ten minutes it took to shoot her photo nickerson said
she was distracted she wanted to do other things
dr. kent brantly became the first american infected while running a treatment center in monrovia
because he is a religious man time shot him at his church in fort worth texas
kent was working in west africa doing a lot of hard selfless work to help people out photographer bryan schutmaat said
among the others considered for person of the year honors were russian president vladimir putin nfl commissioner roger goodell and the protesters in ferguson missouri
other finalists included singer taylor swift chinese internet tycoon jack ma apple ceo tim cook and iraqi kurdish leader masoud barzani
the magazine's readers voted for indian prime minister narendra modi to receive the title but the time editors decision is based on their view of the person or persons who most affected the news and our lives for good or ill and embodied what was important about the year


embarrassment for allies ammunition for enemies but no recommendations laid down for the future treatment of alleged terrorists taken prisoner
it would seem that publication by the senate intelligence committee of its report into the torture of detainees just brought a heap of trouble
the republican chairman of the house intelligence committee mike rogers told cnn that publication was a terrible idea and said foreign leaders have approached the government and said you do this this will cause violence and deaths 
he was not alone on fearing a visceral global reaction
but reaction from overseas has been for the most part muted both among the united states allies and its enemies
none of the major al qaeda affiliates had sought to exploit the often graphic details of the report
the pan arab tv networks focused on a meeting of the gulf co operation council rather than acres of live coverage out of washington
for sure social media lit up and there were plenty of comments from the muslim world
one of hundreds of similar tweets read this is only what the kuffar are acknowledging to the public after hiding for many years
can you even imagine what they are still hiding 
but the dense text and footnotes were not as emotive nor as easily transportable as images from abu ghraib prison of detainee abuse cartoons of the prophet mohammed or video of the koran being burnt
and the story of enhanced interrogation techniques by the cia was hardly new even if some of the techniques were
heavily redacted the report mentions none of the countries there are thought to have been at least eight where cia interrogation took place nor other forms of co operation from allies in the rendition program
in britain a conservative member of parliament andrew tyrie told the daily telegraph
it's impossible to tell how much the report has been redacted or reduced cut to take out the extent of the involvement of other countries in particular america's closest ally the united kingdom
in a two hundred and sixteen page report published last year the open society justice initiative a new york based human rights organization said that secret detention and extraordinary rendition operations designed to be conducted outside the united states under cover of secrecy could not have been implemented without the active participation of foreign governments
and publication of the senate investigation has once more shone a light on the international scope of the cia rendition program reviving interest in the role of european governments and others in hosting the so called black sites where interrogation was carried out and in permitting rendition overflights
one member of the european parliament alyn smith tweeted soon after the report was published
questions now to ask in eu about what our governments knew or should have known
the parliament and european court of human rights have already investigated many cases
the court issued a highly critical judgment against poland this year concluding it for all practical purposes facilitated the whole process created the conditions for it to happen and made no attempt to prevent it from occurring
it awarded substantial damages against poland to two detainees allegedly held there
abu zubaydah suspected of running an al qaeda facility in pakistan and abd al rahim al nashiri alleged to have been involved in the attack on the uss cole
poland is appealing the verdict
former president aleksander kwasniewski told a news conference in warsaw wednesday that poland had agreed to provide a facility where u.s intelligence could obtain information from sources but he said he did not know what the cia was doing there
in an echo of warnings that followed the publication of tens of thousands of us diplomatic cables by wikileaks kwasniewski said that publication of the report meant that the us might lose its ability to have effective intelligence cooperation with allies
everything that has been happening in recent days is significantly strengthening the feeling in many places around the world about the weakness of the usa he said
trust even in your closest ally must be limited
kwasniewski added that he believed the report was an unexpected christmas present for the kremlin which is locked in rhetorical combat with washington on a range of issues
besides poland cases against romania and lithuania also said to have hosted black sites are pending before the european court
as damaging to u.s. international standing as the report may seem right now supporters of publication say it demonstrates that the u.s. examines and owns up to its mistakes as it did with the abu ghraib scandal
senator dianne feinstein who chairs the intelligence committee and was the driving force for the report's publication said it showed the spirit of a just society that functions under law and that when we make mistakes we admit them we correct them and we move on
the same sentiment came from the white house and from paris where the french foreign ministry said the main objective of the international community must stay within the framework of respect for human rights and international humanitarian law
in london british prime minister david cameron said the report's publication was a reminder that we won't succeed if we lose our moral authority if we lose the things that make our systems work and countries successful
but the report's publication has already become a stick for critics of cameron's government
writing in the guardian in the uk columnist simon jenkins says
citizens must know what is done in their name even if it takes time
it has taken the u.s. more than a decade
britain is still waiting for its chilcot report on iraq
the chilcot inquiry which was due to report three years ago has been examining the reasons given for britain joining the invasion of iraq in two thousand and three but its publication has been delayed by requests for thousands of classified government documents including communications between the u.s president george w. bush and prime ministers tony blair and gordon brown of the uk
the united states has a long history of opposing torture in any form or for any purpose
president ronald reagan sent the u.n. convention against torture to the us senate in one thousand nine hundred and eighty eight asking it to outlaw an abhorrent practice
it was ratified in the early days of the george h. bush administration
but years later during the administration of his son president george w. bush consistently argued that enhanced interrogation techniques as they were euphemistically known did not amount to torture
but the revelations included in the senate report leave little doubt that at least some of the practices would by all international standards be defined as torture
many on both sides of the aisle have since spoken of the moral hazard involved in pushing the boundaries of interrogation and the consequences for american leadership
the senate armed services committee concluded in two thousand and eight that u.s. leadership on combating torture helps to build democratic societies and institutions abroad where often torture is used to repress and destroy democratic freedoms
the committee added
u.s. global leadership against torture has serious ramifications for the torture movement and survivors healing worldwide
when he was secretary of state general colin powell argued that the geneva conventions should be applied in afghanistan
in two thousand and two he wrote to the counsel to president george w. bush that if the conventions were ignored europeans and others will likely have legal problems with extradition or other forms of cooperation in law enforcement including in bringing terrorists to justice
there would be a high cost in terms of negative international reaction with immediate adverse consequences for our conduct of foreign policy he said
powell lost the internal debate but the conclusions of the nine eleven commission suggested his advice should have been heeded
the commission said that allegations that the united states abused prisoners in its custody make it harder to build the diplomatic political and military alliances the government will need and recommended that the united states engage its friends to develop a common coalition approach toward the detention and humane treatment of captured terrorists
that has not happened according to the constitution project's task force on detainee treatment whose members included former u.s
under secretary of state thomas pickering and former fbi director william sessions
it reported last year that the u.s. had failed to take meaningful permanent steps to find a common approach on the humane treatment and detention of suspected terrorists
and it echoed the commission's recommendation that the u.s. draw on article three of the geneva conventions on the law of armed conflict
pickering whose diplomatic career spanned five decades said he hoped the report would be a vital chink in opening the door to new legislation in congress that would reinforce the ban on torture
he dismissed the possibility of violence as a reason for not publishing the report
if they can influence u.s. policy by threatening u.s. embassies and personnel then we've lost the game pickering told cnn
pickering a member of the constitution project's panel said the report threw up all sorts of issues that needed international attention such as medical ethics in the treatment of detainees and forced feeding
the u.n. special rapporteur on counter terrorism and human rights ben emmerson said there must also be prosecutions
the individuals responsible for the criminal conspiracy revealed in the report must be brought to justice and must face criminal penalties commensurate with the gravity of their crimes
this applies not only to the actual perpetrators but also to those senior officials within the u.s. government who devised planned and authorized these crimes emmerson said in a statement
amnesty international agreed saying that prosecution is not a policy nicety it is a requirement under international law while human rights watch executive director kenneth roth said that torture would remain a policy option for future presidents unless officials were prosecuted
pickering has mixed feelings about prosecutions
federal officials take an oath to uphold the constitution but many were assured they were acting legally
and he is no fan of going down what he called the latin american route whereby one president puts his predecessor in jail
some people do need to be held to account because some of the conduct is so widely at odds with our values he said
but making an example out of a few people would be a disservice
both president obama and the u.s. justice department have made it clear that they oppose prosecutions
thomas pickering wishes the transparency shown by publication of the senate report had been applied eleven years ago when the office of legal counsel drew up its controversial memos one of which concluded that federal laws against torture assault and maiming would not apply to the overseas interrogation of terror suspects
had that view been made public and widely discussed there might have been no need for a six thousand page senate report

early next year bidders are expected to shell out millions for cars that stood around in roger baillon's yard for decades
the french truck manufacturing mogul had big dreams for them
he wanted to found a museum and build a miniature railroad loop for visitors to ride around and view them a paris auction house said
but the plans evaporated when his business went bust in the one thousand nine hundred and seventy s. he sold off nearly half of his collection but sixty of his classic european luxury and sports cars many built in the first half of the twenty th century remained and collected rust dust and weeds for about fifty years
until car experts from auction house artcurial recently came upon them in a small town in western france not far from la rochelle
now buyers will probably write checks for hundreds of thousands for just one of the sagging exquisite carriages
artcurial will put them under the hammer in february and expects the crown jewel in the collection a one thousand nine hundred and sixty one ferrari two hundred and fifty gt swb california spyder to fetch nine point five million to twelve million euros
the convertible was one of only thirty seven of its kind made and it is in comparatively great condition as it slumbered behind the doors of a snug garage artcurial said
it was piled high with copies of a vintage magazine la vie de l'auto car life when artcurial's car expert pierre novikoff found it
the ferrari's roommate in the garage was a one thousand nine hundred and fifty six maserati a six g gran sport frua that auctioneers think will go for eight hundred thousand to one point two million euros
most of the rest of the other sleeping beauties lay comatose under roofs of corrugated steel held up by posts
with no walls to protect them they were exposed to the elements
novikoff heard about the car yard over the phone and went to check it out
at first glance the cars looked like the rest of the junk in the yard old washing machines metal scrap barrels
but gems gradually sparkled through
nature had taken a hold over the years
ivy had invaded a car and entirely covered its wheel while weeds had taken root in a passenger compartment as easily as in a greenhouse novikoff said
in places the sheets of corrugated iron were resting directly on the cars
baillon died about ten years ago said artcurial spokeswoman rebecca ruff
baillon's son inherited the estate but when he recently died his heirs contacted the auction house to sell the unique collection she added
most of the cars will require a deep kiss of restoration to reawaken the former glory of their exclusive brands some of which are no longer manufactured
bugattis maseratis ferraris delahayes delages hispano suizas talbot lagos and panhard levassors stood motionless in the estate that baillon bought to store them
the largest contingency of the collected cars hit the streets between one thousand nine hundred and fifty five and one thousand nine hundred and sixty five artcurial said in a statement
some have stories to go along with them
the one thousand nine hundred and sixty one ferrari was once owned by french silver screen demigod alain delon artcurial said and he was photographed sitting in it next to jane fonda in one thousand nine hundred and sixty four and with shirley maclaine
legend also slumbers in the peach colored rust covering a pre world war ii talbot lago a french classic brand that died out some fifty years ago
artcurial says this one was driven by former egyptian king farouk


they brave the risk of drowning drifting endlessly or dying of thirst to make it illegally to a better life in europe
migrants traveling often on overfilled boats usually make it
but last year three thousand four hundred and nineteen didn't
they perished in the mediterranean sea the united nations refugee agency said wednesday
some went under like the five hundred killed when their angry traffickers sank their boat on purpose in september according to survivors
the men women and children had refused to transfer to very small boat they felt sure would not hold them and wasn't seaworthy
they asked to be taken back to their departure port in egypt
instead the traffickers rammed their boat and laughed while they watched it sink the survivors said
the seafaring dangers are little deterrent for those leaving abject misery such as the intense bloodshed of wars which is driving hordes into asylum
more than two hundred and seven thousand people have crossed the mediterranean for europe this year illegally almost three times the previous high of about seventy thousand in two thousand and eleven the agency said
that's sixty percents of the three hundred and forty eight thousand boat migrants worldwide this year
figures on such crossings is inexact as many boats elude detection
europe facing conflicts to its south east and south east is seeing the largest number of sea arrivals the unhcr said
nearly fifty percents of the sea arrivals are from the civil war ravaged syria and from eritrea where a dictator has ruled for more than twenty years and where human rights watch says young people are forcibly conscripted into the military often for open ended servitude akin to slavery
the italian government has led search and rescue operations in the mediterranean called mare nostrum or our sea rescuing tens of thousands of migrants
despite pleas from various aid agencies it ended those operations in october
but boat migrants come from many conflict regions
the horn of africa region saw an estimated eighty two thousand six hundred and eighty people crossing mainly from ethiopia and somalia making their way to yemen and other countries in the middle east
and in asia nearly fifty four thousand people have taken to the sea the majority from bangladesh and myanmar crossing through the bay of bengal
last month at least twenty four people died after a boat carrying forty three illegal migrants and asylum seekers sank near istanbul turkey
nine of the passengers were carrying afghan passports

a judge in pretoria ruled wednesday that south african prosecutors can appeal oscar pistorius conviction but denied the state's bid to challenge his sentence
the decision means that the decision over pistorius fate isn't over with the legal battle possibly extending well into next year
prosecutors had said pistorius sentence of five years in prison for fatally shooting his girlfriend was nowhere near enough punishment
they also want the double amputee track star to be convicted of a more serious charge
they had originally sought conviction on a charge of murder
pistorius was found guilty of culpable homicide or negligent killing in the death of reeva steenkamp
the athlete didn't attend the hearing which began tuesday but his father henke was present
i don't think we should have gone this far he told reporters as he left the courtroom
this is what we wanted 
this is what we wanted said nathi mncube a spokesman for the national prosecuting authority
the issues that we wanted clarified are issues of law and of course the judge agreed with our arguments
the victim's mother june steenkamp told cnn's christiane amanpour that she hopes the prospective appeal will be a good thing
i just hope some truth comes out along the way she said

they seem to forget that somebody actually died actually until my niece spoke about her to the judge
and that's the truth
became invisible
in appeal documents filed previously the prosecution called pistorius sentence shockingly light and inappropriate
prosecutors argued that judge thokozile masipa misinterpreted a complex south african standard defining a technical form of intent that proved to be a central aspect of the case according to cnn legal analyst kelly phelps
as a result prosecutors argued pistorius should not have been convicted on the culpable homicide charge chosen by the judge
in explaining her sentence at the trial masipa had said that pistorius did not intend to kill steenkamp
but critics of the verdict have argued that masipa didn't correctly apply the intent standard which is broader in south african law than what it typically means in casual conversation phelps said
appeal could take a year or more
the case now goes to the supreme court of appeals in bloemfontein which will hear the appeal itself
if that court finds pistorius guilty of murder the resulting sentence would be more severe
the minimum sentence for murder in south africa is fifteen years in prison
it usually takes at least a year for an appeal to be heard according to mncube of the national prosecuting authority
pistorius twenty eight made history when he became the first double amputee to compete in the able bodied olympics in two thousand and twelve
he was born without the fibulae in his legs which were amputated below the knee when he was eleven months old
asked what she'd think if pistorius returned to competition reeva steenkamp's mother told cnn to be honest with you i don't care what he does
i've got no interest in him whatsoever june steenkamp said
nothing is going to change my life unless my daughter
could come back by some magic

a german court has thrown out a case against a former ss member accused of participating in the massacre of six hundred and forty two residents of a french village during world war ii
the eighty nine year old had been accused of murdering twenty five people and aiding the murder of several hundred others at oradour sur glane in central france on june ten one thousand nine hundred and forty four
according to the indictment troops surrounded the village before rounding up all the residents in the town square and separating the men from the women and children
the men were shot in four barns which were then burned down
the women and children were imprisoned in a church into which explosives and hand grenades were thrown
troops then set that building alight killing any survivors of the initial attack
there was no doubt that members of the man's panzer regiment had killed the oradour sur glane residents and burned down the village the cologne regional court said in a statement tuesday
but the court said it was unlikely the case against the pensioner named by local media only as werner c. would have been provable
demonstrating he had been present in the village on the day of the massacre would not on its own have been enough to prove the charges against him it said
oradour sur glane mayor philippe lacroix told cnn the decision would be appealed
we need to go through with the lawsuit for the families
time does not excuse the crime he said
germany has worked hard to ensure that the trial takes place and we hope it will succeed
radio france international quoted prosecutor andreas brendel as saying he was surprised by the cologne court's decision despite evidence in such cases being extremely thin
the ruins of oradour sur glane have been preserved as a monument to those killed there
the village's centre de la memoire or memory center says three hundred thousand people visit the martyr village annually

nobel peace prize winner archbishop desmond tutu has canceled his travel for the remainder of the year as he battles cancer one of his foundations said tuesday
in a twitter post tuesday he thanked supporters for the well wishes and concern
you may know i canceled my trip to rome for the world summit of nobel peace laureates due to a reaction to a new treatment for my prostate and strengthening my bones tutu said in a statement posted to his facebook page
it is benign and these issues are par for the course
the desmond and leah tutu legacy foundation first announced the news tuesday

last week he hosted a senior chinese official whose office is responsible for banning facebook along with other popular sites like youtube and twitter in china
in photos posted on china dot com.cn a government run web portal top internet regulator lu wei is seen seated in zuckerberg's chair at facebook's california campus while holding a book with chinese president xi jinping's portrait adorning its cover
the accompanying text explains that when lu found a copy of xi jinping
the governance of china on zuckerberg's desk the young billionaire told the smiling communist party cadre in mandarin
i also bought this book for my colleagues i want them to understand socialism with chinese characteristics
that quote has quickly gone viral online along with a propaganda poster style image that features zuckerberg in a chinese soldier's uniform clutching xi's book to his chest
facebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment
chinese internet users have reacted with as much surprise and amusement as ridicule and disapproval
some sound sympathetic to zuckerberg's strong desire to crack china's internet market the world's largest and a gaping hole in facebook's global reach
he's a smart guy to conquer that market means to cooperate with the chinese government and make money together wrote one twitter user
others however feel betrayed by zuckerberg's apparent kowtowing to beijing authorities who have built one of the world's most extensive internet filtering and censorship systems to restrict speech and crush dissent online
even if you have read all the books by xi or deng xiaoping or mao zedong it's not going to help you in china said another commenter
you're already late in the game and then there is censorship it would make more sense for you to work with google to end internet censorship
china's state media has been smitten with zuckerberg since his october visit to beijing where he wowed students at an elite university by answering their questions in accented but fluent mandarin
to rousing applause the thirty year old internet entrepreneur said he took on the challenge of studying mandarin to communicate with his wife's family and to better appreciate the chinese culture
he also traded his signature hoodie and jeans look for a suit and tie when he met politburo standing committee member wang qishan one of seven men who effectively rule the country at a heavily guarded leadership compound just west of tiananmen square
wang and lu should be zuckerberg's sponsors for joining the communist party and xi can grant his immediate approval for admission tweeted hu jia one of china's most prominent political dissidents upon learning the facebook co founder's remarks to lu about xi's book
i once held up a sign that said regimes that block facebook won't last long he added
now i'm afraid zuckerberg is making a deal or even forming an alliance with the enemy of the internet
for hu and others no facebook at all is preferable to a facebook with chinese characteristics

but within days their celebration has turned to shock and sadness
after a video of the gay wedding spread across egyptian social media the men were arrested and eventually sentenced to three years in prison for distributing pornographic material
homosexuality is not mentioned in the egyptian penal code and technically it is not illegal but members of the lgbt community are often arrested and charged with pornography prostitution or debauchery
at least twenty homosexual and transgender persons were convicted of debauchery and other charges in two thousand and fourteen which human rights activists say has been the worst year for the community in recent memory
fear of arrest and social stigma force the majority of the lgbt community to conceal their identity and sexual orientation
you have to be aware of everything you're doing
your clothes your reactions toward people nour told cnn
he has asked us not to use his real name to protect his identity
both dominant religions in egypt islam and christianity prohibit homosexuality
rather than the literal translation the word usually used for homosexuality in arabic is shezoz meaning abnormality
this category is wide enough to lump together homosexuals and transgender people as one in both media reports and court cases
a video posted on a popular news portal last may showed five people after their arrest at a residential apartment
their faces like their bodies barely covered
two weeks later they were sentenced to twelve seven and four years in prison
among the charges they faced was that of using the internet to spread debauchery
the police would make the defendants go through their contacts and the pictures they post on dating apps and social media to use them as evidence against them and get information on others says dalia abd elhameed gender and women's rights officer at the egyptian initiative for personal rights
earlier this year a group of rights activists reached out to gay dating websites urging them to issue safety warnings to their egyptian users
grindr a gay dating application warned their egyptian users that police may be posing as lgbt on social media to entrap you
in september grindr announced that locations would be hidden by default for users in countries such as egypt saudi arabia and russia which have a history of prosecuting those from the lgbt community
i'm always afraid if i meet someone and he is from the government then i'll get arrested like other people nour said
such fears encompass both the humiliation of having one's identity revealed and the prospect of coming face to face with an unclear judicial procedure
the verdicts in such court cases abd elhameed said were often illogical
take the wedding case for example
the judge cleared them of the debauchery charges yet he sentenced them to three years for filming and distributing pornographic material even though he ruled that there was no debauchery involved
a forensic report from the court found that the men hadn't engaged in homosexual intercourse
i think the police will not treat them as humans
this is a very big problem in egypt said psychiatrist dr. wa'el abu hendy
he says he supports gay rights but he also has another view
my thought about this is that this is something that can be changed can be corrected says abu hendy
of course there are those who can not be cured but we have had many successes with the treatment
that view is widely discredited by leading physiological experts in the west
in two thousand and nine the american psychological association recommended that specialists avoid telling clients that sexual orientation is changeable through therapy or other forms of treatment
it warned of the potential for harm stressing the lack of proof that such types of therapy can lead to a permanent change in sexual orientation
contrary to claims of sexual orientation change advocates and practitioners there is insufficient evidence to support the use of psychological interventions to change sexual orientation said judith m. glassgold chair of the task force that created the apa report
abu hendy claims those expert findings are the result of pressure from the lgbt lobby
but nour said such change attempts were nonsense
my father took me to a psychiatrist once and he gave me this medical thing that actually makes you stop having any sexual feelings but doesn't cure you
know what i mean 
so it's bulls
in the majority of egypt's film productions over the decades homosexuals are stereotypically portrayed as overtly flamboyant and part of criminal or prostitution rings
family secrets a film released earlier this year was ground breaking in having a gay protagonist
the film faced problems with the censors and was criticized when it began showing in egyptian cinemas
the stigma and lack of recognition even extends into the human rights sphere one activist told cnn explaining that some safety guidelines and advocacy work are done anonymously not only due to social rejection but also because of a largely unwelcoming community
what needs to happen is there needs to be an official voice for gay people in egypt ahmed not his real name told cnn
in private more homosexual men and women are coming out to their families in egypt to varying reactions nour said
but in the public sphere the situation is more precarious
lgbt activists say they find their work more difficult than their human rights counterparts in other fields who are already bracing for a potential government crackdown on civil society particularly organizations working on human rights
the activists themselves run a double risk both because of their choice of field and by exposing their identity as members of the lgbt community says abd elhameed
the solidarity with egypt lgbt campaign was launched earlier this year but an online petition against the imprisonment of homosexuals in egypt received just two hundred and sixteen signatures in six months
ahmed would like to see an organization recognized by the government to advocate on the behalf of the lgbt community
he believes this would greatly improve their situation
but with the ministry of religious endowment an influential government agency condemning homosexuality many see little prospect for change
there is no room for dialogue that is my problem with egypt
it is like i want you to ask me about it and i will tell you and maybe you'll understand he says
until that time comes egypt's gays and lesbians will remain in the shadows
hypothetically there could be an uprising
but the whole country would back the mass killings of homosexuals
the whole country would sweep it under the rug they would be behind the violence that's the problem ahmed said
you can't fight the government when you don't have anything to fight the government with

malala's journey from near death to the nobel peace prize
by the time she was fifteen years old malala had already become an outspoken activist for girls right to education

malala has said she wants the prime ministers of pakistan and india to attend the ceremony wednesday where she and satyarthi will receive their awards
peace between the two countries yousafzai said is important for their progress
she said awarding the peace prize to a pakistani muslim and an indian hindu gives a message to people of love between pakistan and india and between different religions


an indonesian maid has told a hong kong court that she was tortured for six months by her former employer who shoved a vacuum cleaner tube into her mouth tearing her mouth
in two days of disturbing testimony erwiana sulistyaningsih a twenty three year old domestic helper said through an interpreter she endured all sorts of abuse including being punched slapped kicked and beaten unconscious
the case sparked international outrage when gruesome images of her injuries surfaced earlier this year and she was admitted to a hospital in indonesia in critical condition
law pleaded not guilty to all charges except one for failing to take out an insurance policy for an employee
speaking calmly erwiana described an incident when she said she was punished for dozing off during work
i was taken to the bathroom and she took off all my clothes and she sprayed cold water on me she said
she said she was not allowed to put her clothes back on and her employer switched on an electric fan and pointed it at her for hours before she was allowed to dress herself
prosecutors accused law a mother of two of using a mop ruler and coat hangers to beat erwiana and also pulled her down from a ladder while she was cleaning
erwiana said on one occasion she was beaten unconscious and after she came to her employer forced her back to work
she often punched my eyes and i was shocked
and she kept on punching and punching me says erwiana
erwiana said she was forced to work for twenty hours a day and was only allowed to sleep between one p.m to five p.m
i had to sleep on the floor says erwiana
all she was given to eat was three to six pieces of bread and a bowl of rice each day
several migrant rights activist groups rallied outside the wanchai district court on monday calling for justice for erwiana
the case also involves charges of assault on two other indonesian domestic helpers tutik lestari ningsih and nurhasanah who were under law's previous employ
she could face up to seven years of imprisonment for the charges of causing grievous bodily harm the maximum term the district court can sentence
in january thousands of people marched to the streets in support of the allegedly abused young indonesian worker
amnesty international issued a public statement in june urging the hong kong government to take immediate action to end the widespread abuse and exploitation of migrant domestic workers
according to a report released last year indonesian migrant workers are at risk of serious human rights violations in hong kong
hong kong employs some three hundred and twenty thousand foreign domestic workers mainly from indonesia philippines and from other parts of asia

after days of relentlessly questioning merrill about his role in the korean war the north korean investigator suddenly switched subjects
they started in on why i came newman recalled
i said it was because i wanted to find out what was really going on in north korea
then they began to focus on my asking our guides to help me locate old soldiers or their relations or descendants if we got to kuwol mountain
they tried to make it into the main reason for my visit
i tried to get across that the business of me contacting people was just an aside
it was just incidental
it wasn't the main thing
the investigator erupted
you're lying
you're guilty of espionage
you've got to be honest with us
i apologized for trying to reconnect
i continued to maintain that the purpose was just to get a better understanding of north korea
but that was the crime in their eyesillegally using the tour as a cover
the north koreans were particularly interested in an email that newman had sent before his trip to his elderly wartime contacts in seoul
the investigator asked about the kuwol comrades
did they have an office 
how big was it 
how much time had merrill spent with them 
i was not completely forthcoming newman said
he sought to downplay the group and his connection to it describing the seoul office as small and nondescript and lying about how much time he'd spent with the former guerrillas
he was worried that his interrogators would realize that he wasn't telling the whole truth but they never did
the investigator also accused merrill of criticizing the dprk referring specifically to his conversation with fellow tourist bob hamdrla in which he noted the resources north korea's government wasted on monuments in such an impoverished country
clearly their guide hyon yi who always seemed to be listening in to their conversations from her seat in the back of their minivan had reported that comment to security officials
in mid november merrill was told again that he committed major crimes and that he was to prepare for a meeting with a senior official where he would make a formal confession
they said
this is the guy who will decide whether you stay or go home 
in the days before the meeting the investigator and the interpreter made merrill write out what he would say
the statement used words they dictated merrill said
i did not try to tidy the language
i wanted it clearly understood by those outside north korea that these were not my words though in my handwriting
the meeting took place on november nine two thousand and thirteen in a large room on the ground floor of the yanggakdo hotel where newman was being held
merrill was wearing a short sleeved shirt but the interpreter told him that was not formal enough so he changed to a long sleeved one
merrill was instructed to be very respectful to stand up when the official entered the room and then to read the statement
the official appeared to be in his fifty s wearing a well tailored uniform with a serious formal demeanor
with video cameras rolling and his hands shaking merrill began
during the korean war i have been guilty of a long list of indelible crimes
as i killed so many civilians and kpa korean people's army soldiers and destroyed strategic objects in the dprk during the korean war i committed indelible offensive acts against the dprk government and korean people
although sixty years have gone by i came to dprk on the excuse of the tour
shamelessly i had a plan to meet any surviving soldiers
i also brought the e book criticizing the socialist dprk and criticizing dprk
i realize that i can not be forgiven for any offensives but i beg for pardon on my knees
please forgive me
at the end of the statement newman bowed to the camera
he then signed it and stamped the paper with his thumbprint
you make a confession because you don't have any choice he said
they have the key
and there isn't any duplicate
but having now done so he thought the north koreans would move to release him
i had a calendar on the wall and i counted those days and i got closer and closer i was figuring there is no way i am still going to be here for thanksgiving
but nothing happened
merrill remained confined in his hotel room
in moments of depression merrill began to wonder if he would ever be released

the bill dissolving the one hundred and twenty seat knesset passed with ninety three votes in favor
no one voted against it
prime minister benjamin netanyahu had called for the dissolution as he sacked two senior members of his coalition cabinet for criticizing government policy
last week the speaker of the knesset said new elections would likely be held on march seventeen
the moves come at a tenuous time in israel which has been beset by a number of recent terrorist attacks against citizens in jerusalem
the head of the right wing likud party netanyahu has been israel's prime minister since two thousand and nine
but he's had to rely on members of other parties many of them to the left of likud on the political spectrum to govern
netanyahu told reporters last week that a divided government was one of israel's problems saying there was a lot of debate contradictions and ultimatums
he ordered letters of dismissal for finance minister yair lapid and justice minister tzipi livni two members of his cabinet from rival parties
during the last few weeks and in particular the last few days the ministers have intensely attacked the government that i am leading netanyahu said

i will not tolerate ministers attacking the government's policy and its head from inside the government
the call for new elections means israel is effectively in a state of political paralysis until march
israel held its last election just twenty two months ago
a poll for israel's channel two suggested that fifty five percents of those surveyed were against another election being held so soon
monday's vote makes the nineteen th knesset one of the shortest serving parliaments in israel's sixty six year history according to natan sachs a foreign policy fellow at the brookings institution's center for middle east policy in washington
the moves come at a tumultuous time for israel sachs wrote in an opinion column for cnn dot com last week
with the dramatic challenges israel faces domestically regionally and internationally expect the sense of malaise in israeli politics to deepen he wrote
these elections may simply be a prelude to a deeper political crisis

not graffiti that's for sure
so it seems an anomaly perhaps that the city should be host to the first gallery in the uae and possibly the middle east dedicated to the art of the spray can
not so says thomas perreaux forest partner in the groundbreaking venture street art gallery in one of dubai's more salubrious suburbs
the frenchman smart handsome well educated is in some ways an unlikely champion of such a polarizing genre
he's the kind of upstanding citizen you might expect to revile youths armed with spray cans
he says the art form goes way beyond graffiti however
his gallery in dubai's jumeirah neighborhood appears to support his theory offering spray painted works an unlikely home in a country largely devoid of graffiti and attracting healthy prices
work at recent exhibitions has been fetching up to and upward of ten thousand dollar
at any one time there are about one hundred pieces on show with exhibitions changing at least once a month
perreaux forest forty three and fellow founder and curator stephane valici forty five knew there would be demand after their shared passion for street art led them to a surprising discovery in the united states
we realized when we were going to gallery openings here in dubai that we couldn't really see what we enjoyed and when we found it it was quite overpriced says perreaux forest
then we were talking to galleries in miami and new york and france and those guys were telling us that people from dubai came over there to buy artworks
this made us think
why not open a gallery
people who are interested in this cross the atlantic so it proves there is demand 
it was still a gamble because it is hard to do a market study but the feedback as soon as we opened was absolutely amazing
first show wynwood goes dubai celebrated a miami district where street artists are free to spray paint without hassle from police
it's a very creative place
there's a big street artist community there and during our last trip we met lots of artists and signed ten male and female from miami some from new york and la
that exhibition was a sneak preview of their work
the gallery's third exhibition be the change was certainly a departure from what dubai's healthy but largely commercial art scene was used to
it celebrated some of the more brash examples of street art and graffiti with some work examining public protest
again not something the uae experiences too often

before long big international names in the genre were getting involved
parisian veteran nasty brought signs and wall tiles from the french capital's metro decorated in his inimitable style
nasty is very experienced and well known and began in the eighties by tagging trains says perreaux forest
he has just had an exhibition in hong kong
fellow french street star onemizer who does everything from portraits to comic style work flew in as did geneva based mural specialist bandi who also comes from france but has created futuristic work inspired by dubai
swiss born and now dubai based justone brought possibly the most controversial work inspired by incendiary street protest in addition to a decorated chunk of wall that he has on permanent display in the gallery
by contrast the gallery recently curated a special exhibition to compliment the holy month of ramadan
calligraffiti matched street art with arabic writing given a modern twist by local talent
we took the opportunity of ramadan to do something about the art of writing adds perreaux forest
here in the region arab calligraphy is very important and is a real art form in itself
there is an evolution in this particular art
on the other side the graffiti started with lettering guys signing or tagging streets or trains
so it was interesting to mix those arts of writing the classical but modern calligraphy with the writing in graffiti a mix of ancient and modern
and we managed to find some calligraphers that do much more modern pieces than we're used to seeing in galleries around the region
some were very close to street art
it proved an exciting glimpse into where dubai could go with the genre and flushed out some indigenous potential
we would be very keen to display more local street artists adds perreaux forest when asked whether he plans to showcase and nurture some of that native talent

is dubai the next big theme park destination 
a few of those artists mingle and exchange ideas during the gallery's frequent and vibrant opening nights
for the moment we are focusing on established artists but a bit of what we do is to help the local scene and raise the level says perreaux forest
it's good to visit a gallery to meet experienced artists to improve your style and work and that's what i believe is needed here
street art is not allowed anywhere but it can be tolerated in western countries
here it is not really the case and we don't want graffiti all over the place
but one of our missions is to help the local guys and to make local culture and people from the region understand that street art is not about degradation and that there are many different styles in street art
for now street art gallery is opening its walls to the likes of jenni perez godzilla hep and one love and is plotting a busy two thousand and fifteen as its own exterior white walls are gradually replaced by visiting artists spraying what they think of dubai's new art hotspot
street art gallery is currently hosting one of the first and most infamous graffiti writers of the south florida movement
miami's hec one love is showcasing more than one hundred of his works in dubai under the banner loveism until december ten
the artist is known for his massive walls and post graffitism abstracts and the dubai show represents his biggest publicly displayed collection yet

home minister rajnath singh said his ministry had advised state governments to ensure that the operations of the web based taxi services are stopped and that non licensed operators are prohibited until they register with authorities
transport authorities in new delhi on monday announced a ban on uber services in the indian capital saying their investigation revealed the company was violating permit rules
authorities say uber was operating as a local taxi on a national permit
commercial vehicles on national permit can not operate as taxis ferrying passengers from one destination to another within a city
new delhi police say they will implement the ban
but uber said it hadn't been officially notified of the measure and that its service was still operating in the city
singh said police were exploring what he called uber's possible legal liability in the rape case in which a twenty six year old woman alleges she was assaulted at the weekend after being taken to a deserted stretch of road in an uber car she had ordered
new delhi police have filed a case against uber under sections relating to cheating and violation of government rules and orders said deputy police commissioner madhur verma
shiv kumar yadav the uber driver accused of raping his passenger remains in police custody for questioning
police say yadav's address and background weren't verified in his driver registration
uber said in a statement that it exclusively partners with registered drivers who have been through the commercial licensing process and who have government identification and state issued permits
it called the alleged rape abhorrent and said it was cooperating with the investigation
uber drew heavy criticism last month after one of its executives suggested that it would be fair game to dig up dirt on journalists who were critical of his company
a u.s. tech journalist singled out by the executive said there was anescalating and scary pattern of misogyny at uber citing the way uber has dealt with assault complaints from female riders and a recent promo offering free rides with beautiful women

heather cho whose korean name is cho hyun ah resigned tuesday from the airline's catering and in flight sales business and its cabin service and hotel business divisions an airline spokesman said
but she is keeping her title as a vice president of the national carrier he said
as for the next steps the spokesman told cnn there is an investigation going on so we will have to see
the incident occurred friday at new york's jfk airport on a flight due to take off for the south korean city of incheon
cho reportedly demanded that the plane go back to the gate so the crew member who served her macadamia nuts out of a bag rather than on a plate in first class could be kicked off the flight
although her role put her in charge of in flight service she was only a passenger on this flight and was not flying in an official capacity
according to south korean news agency yonhap cho is the eldest daughter of korean air's chairman cho yang ho
he apologized tuesday for any inconvenience caused to passengers and said the incident would be investigated the news agency reported
korean air also issued an apology on heather cho's behalf yonhap reported in which she asked for forgiveness
i will take full responsibility for the incident and step down from my post she is quoted as saying
korean air apologized for any discomfort to those on the flight and said there had been no safety issues involved
the plane arrived at its destination only eleven minutes behind schedule according to yonhap
even though it was not an emergency situation backing up the plane to order an employee to deplane was an excessive act the airline said in a statement
we will re educate all our employees to make sure service within the plane meets high standards

the majority report issued by the senate intelligence committee is a damning condemnation of the tactics branded by critics as torture the george w. bush administration deployed in the fear laden days after the september eleven two thousand and one terrorist attacks
the techniques according to the report were deeply flawed poorly managed and often resulted in fabricated information
the report is reigniting the partisan divide over combating terrorism that dominated washington a decade ago
democrats argue the tactics conflict with american values while leading members of the bush administration insist they were vital to preventing another attack
the cia immediately hit back at the report saying in a statement that the program was effective and substantially helped its understanding of al qaeda's tactical operations and goals
but president barack obama said the report reinforced his view that the harsh interrogation methods were not only inconsistent with our values as a nation they did not serve our broader counterterrorism efforts or our national security interests
in its most graphic details an executive summary of the report finds that conditions for detainees at top secret overseas interrogation sites were much harsher than the cia has previously admitted
it finds that high value detainees were subjected to methods like waterboarding and sleep deprivation in near nonstop fashion for days or weeks at a time
in many cases the most aggressive techniques were used immediately in combination and nonstop the report says
sleep deprivation involved keeping detainees awake for up to one hundred and eighty hours usually standing or in painful stress positions at times with their hands shackled above their heads
in one facility a detainee was said to have died of hypothermia after being held partially nude and chained to a concrete floor while at other times naked prisoners were hooded and dragged up and down corridors while being slapped and punched
multiple cia detainees subjected to the techniques suffered from hallucinations paranoia insomnia and tried to mutilate themselves the report says
on one occasion high value al qaeda suspect abu zubaydah became completely unresponsive after a period of intense waterboarding
he had bubbles rising through his open full mouth the report says
meanwhile the confessed mastermind of the september eleven attacks khalid shaikh mohammed was subjected to a series of near drownings
the report finds that at least one hundred and nineteen detainees went through the cia detention program and at least twenty six were held wrongfully partly because there was no information to justify their detention
previously the cia had said only one hundred prisoners had been processed through the program democratic senate aides said
the report suggests that the controversial enhanced interrogation techniques did not produce information necessary to save lives that was not already available from other means
that is important because supporters of the program have always said that it was vital to obtaining actionable intelligence from detainees that could not be extracted through conventional interrogations
it also discounts cia claims in two thousand and eleven that enhanced interrogation of al qaeda operative hassan ghul produced information which led them to osama bin laden's courier abu ahmad al kuwaiti
the breakthrough which eventually helped the agency track down the al qaeda leader's hideout in abbottabad pakistan was extracted before ghul was subjected to harsh treatment the report said
in its scathing response to the report released even before senate intelligence committee chairwoman dianne feinstein rose on the senate floor to unveil it the cia said it was unknowable whether it could have received the same information from terror suspects using alternative methods
it said the conclusions of the report contained too many flaws for it to stand as official record of the program and said many of the charges were based on authors flawed analysis of the value of the intelligence obtained from the detainees
obama outlawed enhanced interrogation techniques soon after becoming president in two thousand and nine and admitted in august we tortured some folks
as commander in chief he faces many of the same dilemmas on how to fight terrorism as his predecessor
but the tone of his response to the report was nevertheless critical
he acknowledged in his statement that the bush administration had faced agonizing choices about how to pursue al qaeda and prevent additional terrorist attacks against our country
our nation did many things right in those difficult years
at the same time some of the actions that were taken were contrary to our values
feinstein said that the cia's actions in the aftermath of nine eleven were a stain on our values and on our history
the release of this five hundred page summary can not remove that stain but it can and does say to our people and the world that america is big enough to admit when it's wrong and confident enough to learn from its mistakes she said
in april three republicans on the intelligence committee voted to declassify the report
but georgia sen. saxby chambliss the committee's top gop member also released a minority rebuttal to the document taking issues with its methodology and findings
the rebuttal said the report created the false impression that the cia was actively misleading policy makers and impeding the counterterrorism efforts of other federal government agencies during the program's operation
director of national intelligence james clapper said he did not believe that any other nation would go to the lengths the united states does to bare its soul admit mistakes when they are made and learn from those mistakes
thousands of marines at u.s. diplomatic posts and military bases around the world are on alert amid fears the graphic details of how detainees were treated could spark a violent backlash
but there was little initial interest on jihadi forums about the report said laith alkhouri a senior analyst at flashpoint partners a u.s. organization that tracks jihadi websites
intelligence sources told cnn's pentagon correspondent barbara starr however that the threat of retaliatory attacks could come in days rather than hours as information filters across the world
those sources added that currently there is no specific threat
the full report is more than six thousand pages long
but after a prolonged tussle between the cia and the committee over how much of the material should be classified the document being released tuesday is four hundred and eighty pages long
senior members of the bush administration have also voiced disquiet that the report is being released and defended their actions those of administration lawyers and cia agents charged with the interrogations
former president george w. bush told cnn's candy crowley last week that the united states was fortunate to have men and women who work hard at the cia serving on our behalf
these are patriots
these are good people
really good people
former vice president dick cheney told the new york times that claims that the cia was out of bounds or that the interrogation program was a rogue operations were a bunch of hooey
the program was authorized
the agency did not want to proceed without authorization and it was also reviewed legally by the justice department before they undertook the program cheney said
countries that cooperated with the cia hosting black site prisons and assisting in transferring detainees are identified only obliquely and not by name
cia employees referred to by pseudonyms in the report aren't being identified
however the agency pushed for the pseudonyms to be redacted because other information in the report could be used to determine who the employees are
for some republicans and cia supporters there's still a dispute about whether techniques such as waterboarding constitute torture
the justice department twice has investigated the conduct of cia employees involved in the program and decided not to bring charges

south african prosecutors say oscar pistorius sentence of five years in prison for shooting dead his girlfriend is nowhere near enough punishment
they want the double amputee track star to be convicted of a more serious charge and to face a longer prison term
on tuesday a court in pretoria began hearing arguments for and against an appeal of the original verdict in which pistorius was found guilty of culpable homicide or negligent killing in the death of reeva steenkamp
in appeal documents filed previously the prosecution called pistorius sentence shockingly light and inappropriate
they had originally sought conviction on a charge of murder
prosecutors are arguing that judge thokozile masipa misinterpreted a complex south african standard defining a technical form of intent that proved to be a central aspect of the case according to cnn legal analyst kelly phelps
as a result prosecutors argue he should not have been convicted on the culpable homicide charge chosen by the judge
in explaining her sentence masipa concluded that pistorius did not intend to kill steenkamp
but critics of the verdict have argued that masipa didn't correctly apply the intent standard which is broader in south african law than what it typically means in casual conversation phelps says
in their appeal of the sentence prosecutors will have to prove the five years given by masipa is inappropriate in light of sentencing guidelines and similar cases according to phelps
prosecutor gerrie nel called for a minimum sentence of ten years
if judge masipa sides with the prosecution on tuesday the case will go to the supreme court of appeals in bloemfontein which will then hear the appeal itself opening the door to the possibility of a harsher sentence
if she sides with the defense and the verdict is not overturned it could lead to a more lenient sentence according to phelps
under south african law pistorius has to serve at least one sixth of his sentence ten months as things stand before asking to be placed under correctional supervision
correctional supervision usually means house arrest
pistorius twenty eight made history when he became the first double amputee to compete in the able bodied olympics in two thousand and twelve
he was born without the fibulae in his legs which were amputated below the knee when he was eleven months old

russia unexpectedly flew military aircraft into the baltic sea region on both saturday and sunday in an action closely monitored by u.s. and nato intelligence a u.s. official confirmed to cnn
about a dozen russian aircraft including bombers and refueling aircraft flew off kaliningrad in the baltic sea on saturday
nato aircraft as well as aircraft from sweden and finland monitored the russian flights the official said
then on sunday the russians again flew about a dozen aircraft including bombers and transport planes on the same route
the u.s. official noted there have been similar large flights in the past but it's not been seen in this manner over a two day period
the u.s. and nato are still assessing what message moscow may be trying to send but overall it's a putin show of force the us official said
this was a large incursion said col. steven warren pentagon spokesman
the russian aircraft remained in international airspace but did enter an aircraft identification zone at one point
on saturday prior to the second round of flights pentagon press secretary rear adm. john kirby issued a statement saying the saturday flights were significant
kirby said the saturday flight was larger than what they've seen before but not considered threatening
the overflight is doing nothing to ease tensions
but while it is bigger than what we've seen it is not raising alarm bells in nato kirby said

uruguay
a u.s. medical aircraft carrying the six former guantanamo bay detainees landed at a military base in the uruguayan capital montevideo in the middle of the night cnn affiliate canal ten uruguay reported on sunday
within a few hours a caravan of fifteen to twenty vehicles including ambulances drove the newly freed men to hospitals
the u.s. defense department confirmed the transfer sunday and said it coordinated with the government of uruguay to make sure the transfers took place with adequate security and with humane treatment
the united states is grateful to the government of uruguay for its willingness to support ongoing u.s. efforts to close the guantanamo bay detention facility the department said
gop congressman
we ought to rethink gitmo transfer policy
we have offered our hospitality for humans suffering a heinous kidnapping in guantanamo uruguayan president jose mujica wrote on his presidential website on friday
the unavoidable reason is humanitarian
four of the former detainees ahmed adnan ahjam ali hussain shaabaan omar mahmoud faraj and jihad diyab are syrian nationals while abdul bin mohammed abis ourgy is tunisian and mohammed tahanmatan is palestinian pentagon press secretary rear adm. john kirby said sunday
canal ten reported that the united nations refugee agency will be responsible for returning the released prisoners to their homes
their transfers to uruguay were unanimously approved by the united states guantanamo review task force which represents six departments and agencies
the review was prompted by an executive order issued by president barack obama shortly after his inauguration in january two thousand and nine
defense secretary chuck hagel informed congress of the intent to transfer the six men the defense department said
saturday's transfers leave only one hundred and thirty six detainees at guantanamo bay out of more than seven hundred and fifty
that's the lowest number of inmates at the base in cuba since detainees started arriving in two thousand and two
what happens when detainees leave guantanamo bay 
at least seven detainees have died in custody over the years
in mujica's open letter he also called for the united states to lift its embargo on cuba and release some cubans and puerto ricans he called political prisoners

at the height of his power zhou yongkang controlled police forces spy agencies court systems and prosecution offices across china and the domestic security czar wasn't shy in deploying his vast assets to crush dissent and unrest in the name of preserving social stability
during his reign before retiring in two thousand and twelve as worsening income inequality and official corruption fueled mass discontent nationwide zhou oversaw the domestic security budget swell to surpass that of the two million strong chinese military the world's largest
as a member of the ruling communist party's politburo standing committee china's top decision making body zhou was one of nine men who effectively ruled the country of more than one point three billion people
away from the spotlight though zhou and his family members were reportedly taking advantage of his leadership position to accumulate enormous wealth
the allegedly blatant exchange between money and power as revealed by china's state media would eventually prompt zhou's shocking downfall last summer
after months of intense political rumors the communist party's disciplinary arm in late july announced a formal investigation into zhou for serious disciplinary violations
on saturday state run xinhua news agency reported his arrest after the communist leadership expelled him from the party
zhou's case was sent to the country's highest prosecution authority paving the way for a criminal trial that would make him the most senior official ever to face corruption charges in the history of the people's republic
party investigators found the seventy one year old former leader received huge bribes abused his power to benefit family and friends and leaked state secrets according to xinhua
he was also accused of having affairs with multiple women and trading power and money for sex
many have viewed his fall from grace as a watershed moment in the secretive world of chinese politics now ruled by president xi jinping who has been spearheading a massive anti corruption campaign ostensibly targeting tigers and flies high ranking and low level officials alike
the important thing here is that xi has proven he's powerful enough to break this taboo of never incriminating former politburo standing committee members said longtime political analyst willy lam with chinese university of hong kong
unlike xi who is communist royalty thanks to his father's status as one of chairman mao's comrades in arms during the revolution zhou was born to a poor family in eastern china
his father was an illiterate farmer but borrowed money to send him to school
smart and hardworking zhou didn't disappoint and went on to become one of the few local students admitted into an elite university in beijing
that school now called china university of petroleum was the cradle for titans in the state oil industry
after graduating with a degree in oil exploration zhou was assigned to an oil field in the country's northeast and rose through the official ranks from the late one thousand nine hundred and sixty s through the mid one thousand nine hundred and eighty s
described by many as a capable and humbling young party cadre zhou was remembered more for his political savviness than technical knowledge
his political skill shone when he was transferred to the oil ministry in beijing which later became a giant state owned oil company and one of zhou's power bases
read
in china everyone is guilty of corruption 
overcoming factional wars in the ministry zhou was said to be a decisive leader who focused on expanding domestic oil exploration as well as overseas projects a two pronged strategy that would continue to this day
fast growth of business abroad made supervision from beijing harder sowing the seeds for corruption
in two thousand and one after a stint as minister of land resources zhou was named the communist party chief of sichuan in southwest china one of the country's most populous provinces
state media there portrayed zhou as an eloquent leader with a clear vision and credited him for luring high tech companies including intel to the southwestern province as well as modernizing the agriculture and tourism sectors
zhou also developed strong local ties and planted officials loyal to him including secretaries he brought from beijing in key postings throughout the province
zhou's big break came in two thousand and two when he returned to beijing and was put in charge of the ministry of public security which runs the country's police forces
five years later he rose to the apex of power by taking a seat in the nine member politburo standing committee with an expanded portfolio that covered all domestic security affairs
his reign coincided with a time of mounting social and ethnic unrest as well as such major events as the beijing olympics in two thousand and eight the sixty th anniversary of the people's republic in two thousand and nine and the world expo in shanghai in two thousand and ten
as the leadership prioritized security and stability above all else zhou greatly expanded police power at the expense of already limited judicial independence cementing his reputation as a ruthless hardliner among political dissidents and activists
it was also during this period that zhou became a patron of bo xilai a fast rising political star who was waging his own controversial war against organized crime in the southwestern metropolis of chongqing
bo's spectacular downfall in two thousand and twelve complete with tales of murder bribery and betrayal attracted global attention
state media cited his subsequent conviction on corruption charges as a prime example of xi's resolve to clean up the party
bo supporters however have long called him a political victim as the former high flying politician was once considered xi's main challenger for the top spot of chinese leadership
political activists and observers now note the similarity between the bo and zhou cases
zhou challenged xi's authority and threatened his rule that's why he's now being held responsible along with his gangs offered hu jia one of china's leading political dissidents who was thrown into prison for more than three years on subversion charges when zhou first took over nationwide law enforcement
the bottom line is
all officials are corrupt he added
xi can't find a better excuse to rid of his political opponents than fighting corruption something that helps him win the masses hearts and minds
the people being investigated for corruption are on the losing side of factional struggles echoed lam the hong kong analyst
people who are close to xi are less liable to becoming incriminated
those close to zhou have fallen with him
state media have reported official investigations and formal arrests in some cases into dozens of zhou's family members and former aides
the biggest impact was felt in the domestic security apparatus state oil industry and sichuan province three places zhou once ruled
details have also emerged in chinese media about possible skeletons in zhou's closet including the suspicious circumstances surrounding the death of his first wife
most stories though have focused on the vast wealth amassed by zhou's older son as well as his two brothers and their families
the zhous reportedly benefited immensely from china's booming energy and real estate sectors thanks to zhou's deep ties to the two related ministries
zhou's older son who is forty two is said to own multiple luxury properties worth millions of dollars
before even turning thirty the younger zhou's first foray into business met with fast growth and quick success after winning a contract to upgrade it systems for eight thousand gas stations across china
his companies also reportedly reaped huge financial gain from buying and selling oil fields and hydropower stations
state media reports also indicated that one of zhou's younger brothers a onetime farmer used zhou's influence to launch a crisis management business and profited from helping people get out of jail enter police academy and sell steel pipes to state owned oil fields
other published articles have painted an intricate web of officials cronies and tycoons some with alleged mafia connections orbiting around the domestic security czar before the crumbling of his power structure
i think unlike bo xilai zhou yongkang will cooperate with investigators because his family is involved said analyst lam predicting a suspended death sentence for both zhou and his older son
his only incentive now is to protect his son he will toe the line to protect his son



the family of american photojournalist luke somers who was held hostage and then killed by al qaeda's affiliate in yemen did not know of u.s. efforts to rescue him until the terrorist group released a video of him pleading for his life last week family members told cnn on monday
somers and south african pierre korkie a teacher were fatally shot amid a failed u.s. military raid to rescue them friday
the family was not asked to sign off on the u.s. effort to free somers his stepmother penny bearman and sister lucy somers said
some family members condemned the rescue bid as endangering life though the general feeling is that more should have been done sooner they said
we feel that luke's stance would have been that more discussion should have taken place between the countries concerned and that these crises should be solved with more dialogue and less conflict bearman and somers said
the hostage takers did not communicate directly with somers family so if there were any specific demands they were given to the u.s. government in private the two women said
somers thirty three was born in the united kingdom
uk foreign office minister tobias ellwood responded to an urgent question in britain's house of commons monday on the failed rescue
it was for the americans to make a judgment on this ellwood said
it was decided that the threat to life was imminent and therefore action needed to be taken
he reiterated that britain did not negotiate with hostage takers saying that the uk government believed that paying ransoms simply encourages more hostages to be taken
like many journalists of his generation somers traveled to the middle east to tell the stories of the region's strife and the people affected by it
his friends said the arab spring uprising in two thousand and eleven was a motivator
he was taken hostage in september two thousand and thirteen
a november raid by u.s. and yemeni special forces freed eight other hostages but not somers
the militants subsequently issued demands and a threat to kill him
the committee to protect journalists said somers was the third american freelance journalist to die this year while being held captive after james foley and steven sotloff were murdered in syria
the organization also pointed out that the raid is at least the third to be launched by u.s. special forces in an attempt to rescue american journalists held hostage in syria and yemen
all of the raids failed to rescue the journalists

when fighting climate change that same spirit of entrepreneurship is vital
governments have set a goal of limiting average global temperature rise to less than two degrees celsius
achieving this requires a move towards climate neutrality in the second half of the century
innovation entrepreneurship and vision are critically important elements to meeting this goal
the good news is that there are thousands of examples of entrepreneurs around the world who are finding a constantly expanding market for their solutions they are part of the united nations climate change secretariat's momentum for change initiative
take wandee khunchornyakong in thailand
she began her career by connecting rural villages with solar power
khunchornyakong built a modest manufacturer of photovoltaic solar panels into a multi million dollar industry leading to the company's public offering and her early retirement in two thousand and seven
she spotted an opportunity and seized upon it
observing regulatory changes in thailand's energy market she visited the local authority to obtain more permits to build solar farms
the clerk she spoke to said
please take more since no one else wants them
this fed khunchornyakong's vision of sunny northeast thailand as a global leader in large scale solar energy
she leveraged funding from the international finance corporation toward her vision building thailand's largest solar power generation company
today the solar power company group drives growth in the photovoltaic market across southeast asia
recognizing leadership matters
in doing so we inspire others to take similar entrepreneurial action
khunchornyakong's business is just one of twelve innovative climate solutions that the united nations climate change secretariat will showcase at the upcoming round of climate talks beginning this week in lima peru
action on climate change has reached a tipping point
this past september four hundred thousand people participated in the largest ever global protest calling for action on climate change
a few weeks ago in an unprecedented series of announcements twenty one countries pledged a total of up to nine point six billion dollar to enable the world to move to a low emission climate resilient future
earlier the united states and china likewise announced a historic agreement to reduce their emissions
the european union committed to ambitious goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least forty percents by two thousand and thirty
over the next fifteen years some ninety dollar trillion will be invested in infrastructure globally greening this will require big medium sized and small entrepreneurial companies
all great endeavors have humble beginnings
somewhere in the world there is an entrepreneur in a garage or a duka designing the next game changing climate solution that offers yet another catalyst towards a healthier greener and more secure world

burying your loved ones in intricate beautifully crafted and at times a little surreal caskets is a common tradition in some parts of the the west african nation
based in awutu a small town in ghana's central region self taught carpenter kudjoe affutu has made a name for himself with his eye catching style of coffins
i love playing with the wood he says
i didn't study it in the school i just love carving
the plucky young artisan has always had a passion for woodwork and inspired by artists before him such as kane kwei and paa joe his startup began to take shape
i saw a designed coffin somewhere and i said
no i have to do this and i forced my parents to push me into it
by two thousand and seven affutu had opened the new generation woodwork shop
seven years on and the craftsman has found big success thanks to his fantastical funerary boxes
burial rites in ghana are incredibly important in honoring ancestry
in a country where the passing of a loved one is often celebrated with a party like fervor the elaborate coffin art allows mourning family members and friends to send their dearly departed off to the afterlife in style
affutu adds
it's a special coffin that talks a lot about the deceased
but also for the family who sees it to as a last gift to the deceased
often designs for these figurative coffins reflect the deceased's vocation or personality
perhaps if you worked as a farmer a chicken casket could be for you
what about a fashion designer 
well a sewing machine what else 
prices for a custom made coffin from affutu vary due to design request size and where the casket needs to be shipped to
when it's local it could be around one thousand ghanaian cedi and above
exported ones are one thousand dollar or more
over the years affutu has heard some weird wonderful and downright bizarre requests for casket creations
yet whatever the request he doesn't judge a family's choice he just sees it as a challenge
i just think of it and am done
i always see my orders as normal no matter how weird it is explains the artisan coffin maker
he adds
a family came here some two years ago and they said our late mother used to be a midwife and we want a designed coffin something that can talk about her work and i came up with a pregnant woman who is about to deliver and it was a fantastic piece
affutu has also constructed a variety of fisherman inspired pieces for departed sea workers including canoes fishing boats nets and of course a variety of fish
today affutu employs six full time staff
but with an increased workforce other problems arise
like today for example we have a lot of work here and i don't have a big shop
he adds
sometimes the materials we use it can be scarce for a while and we don't have enough money to gather or to store materials for many years
however affutu is optimistic about the future in the next five years i want to extend my shop and even the workers or apprentices i have so that when somebody orders something you can deliver days before its time

being a professional fine art taxidermist it's obvious what category he places himself
i know it's hard to believe but the presence of death has nothing to do with it for me says the dutch artist
it's about shapes color and construction not death
but if you think it's gross i can't even start to explain the beauty to you
then after a moment of reflection he adds
i'm not weird
as part of the darwin sinke van tongeren collective which makes the unusual move of including charles darwin as a member van tongeren and his artistic partner jaap sinke create extraordinary taxidermy artworks that have been and acclaimed all over the world
the pieces are inspired by the paintings of seventeen th century painters like jan weenix melchior d'hondecoeter and adriaen van olen and have been called flamboyant seventeen th century luxury
the blend of retro cool and exquisite workmanship led one reviewer to say that it elevates taxidermy to a higher plane
there is no doubt
van tongeren and sinke who sport wild hair and beards and wear matching leather aprons are the hottest thing to happen to taxidermy in decades
demand is growing for their work with pieces selling for between two thousand and twenty five thousand. n twenty five november their latest exhibition will be coming to the shapero rare book store in london
given these achievements many find it hard to believe that van tongeren has only been in the game for three years
i was forty seven years old and was running my own advertising agency he recalls
we were on a family holiday in new zealand and over dinner i just said to my wife i know what i want to do
i want to be a taxidermist 
it had never occurred to me before that day and it changed my life overnight
his wife has accepted it and his two children he says love it
his fifteen year old son helps with the stuffing and his six year old daughter likes it too though she gets a bit worried when i start stroking the cat
part of the secret to the duo's success is the quality that is evident from their work
in some quarters taxidermy has become quite trendy over recent years but it's rare to find stuffed animals that can genuinely be mistaken for living creatures
we use the old fashioned victorian methods he explains
in those days labor was not so expensive so they took their time over everything
but now mass production has taken over so speed has taken over
most modern taxidermists buy a ready made mannequin and stretch the skin over the top
but we take months over each animal
we do it as it should be done and the results speak for themselves
it takes months rather than hours
among the works of art van tangeren and sinke have produced are a beautiful flamingo with raised wings
a parrot with its feathers spread into an artistic action pose
a monkey with its tail raised in a flamboyant circle
and a red billed blue magpie wings and tail stretched back as if in some magical flight
i love birds says van tangeren
we have a network of breeders and zoos who give us a call when a rare animal dies
as an artist it's a big advantage to start with something beautiful in itself
you can't use paint to make colors like some birds have
the intensity of the colors and the layers of their feathers is breathtaking
in retrospect van tangeren's sudden epiphany three years ago was not such a surprise
since he was a child he says he was fascinated by dead animals and has been collecting skulls all his life
in a way it's about owning something beautiful he says
as a child you don't really own anything but when you find a skull you have a feeling that this is something worth a lot
that is the feeling that has stayed with me
i know it's hard to believe but it's about capturing and holding beauty not death
avant gardens 
when art design and a whole load of plants collide
glamor and grieving
how the victorians dressed for death
intoxicating investment
how some whisky lovers are now making millions
this expressionist painted the world's most radical nudes one hundred years ago

i would be at the office at eleven pm on sunday when other girls are dancing or something
i think my boss saw my passion and he gave me a chance she says
if we had more mentors like that in africa i believe the younger generation would blossom faster
it's ok to work things out as you go
at twenty five adenowo decided to go it alone and start her own company ad consulting
it was a big risk to undertake but her reputation as one of nigeria's most prominent architects proves that sometimes you have jump into the unknown
the office was a little bigger than three chairs
it was myself and a young boy who sat in the corridor but i started anyway because i believe that you do what you can with what you have where you are
great architecture isn't just a building
adenowo explains that to build a great building you have to have an omniscient outlook
you have to know history you have to understand culture sociology anthropology
you need to know physics you have to understand chemistry to a point
you have to understand art and the history of art to be a really good architect she says
good architecture is about the spirit of the age
if you look at a pyramid it talks about one man's quest to be immortal
it's four thousand five hundred years old and we still see them
we can no longer forget those pharaohs because of architecture
go a step further than three d. my buildings all have a fourth dimension and the fourth dimension is time
each space i design changes in time
i design lighting schemes in such a way that by night the building is a totally different entity from what it was in the morning
i design buildings in such a way that as you move through the space you experience something new at every step
passion doesn't just come from within
the passion comes from my clients
i feed off their energy
i would do anything for my clients to make sure that their buildings come out the way they should
take ownership and inspire
despite juggling a prosperous career and a family at home adenowo still finds time to mentor women through her weekly radio show
she also founded the awesome treasures foundation in one thousand nine hundred and ninety nine which helps mentor women and young girls
we believe the greatest need of africa is leadership vision
strong people who are ready to give their all to say this is the way and awesome treasures is here to address that need to raise transformational leaders
the sky's the limit
adenowo may have achieved great success but that doesn't mean she's resting on her laurels
in the next five years it would be a dream come true if i have the opportunity to design a building that would define nigeria's identity
the way you see the tour d'eiffel and you think paris the empire state building and you think new york

affected by the storm 
send your photos to cnn ireport but please stay safe
legazpi philippines the deadly storm that battered the philippines for days weakened monday as it rumbled from one island to another passing close to the densely populated capital city of manila
officials revised the death toll downward to twenty five from twenty seven on wednesday after two people were found alive philippine red cross chairman richard gordon told cnn
tropical storm hagupit which was downgraded from typhoon strength monday slammed into the eastern philippines late saturday
it brought fierce winds and torrential rain to roughly the same region ravaged by super typhoon haiyan in november last year
but while haiyan left more than seven thousand people dead or missing hagupit's toll so far remains in the double digits
hagupit has had a powerful impact across several major philippine islands driving hundreds of thousands of people from their houses tearing down trees and causing floods
it has destroyed nearly one thousand homes gwendolyn pang the secretary general of the philippine red cross told cnn
i am worried i am thinking of my children and my grandchildren
they are so young that's why we're here said pilar rangosajo a grandmother taking refuge in an evacuation center in the city of legazpi
it's so hard for me because every typhoon damages our home
we don't have the money to fix it
her concerns are common in a country where many people live in lightly built wooden houses
as hagupit known locally as ruby continued to howl over the archipelago officials have begun to assess the scale of the damage in the regions it hit
emergency response teams are trying to reach some of the remote areas where little is known about the storm's effects
but officials praised the success of efforts to relocate large numbers of people away from vulnerable coastal areas citing fears of a repeat of last year's devastation as a motivating factor
people didn't have to be pushed anymore gordon said
they knew that they could face another haiyan and haiyan killed a lot of people from storm surges
in tacloban the city hardest hit by haiyan around half the two hundred thousand residents evacuated to safer areas ahead of hagupit the u.n. humanitarian agency ocha philippines said
hagupit has been less powerful than haiyan but it is moving at a much slower pace
weather forecasters said that means hagupit will dump large amounts of heavy rain on areas in its path increasing the risk of landslides and flash floods
it doesn't matter right now if it's a typhoon or tropical storm this is a rainmaker meteorologist tom sater said
noel rosal the mayor of legazpi said that for almost twenty hours we were battered by rain and strong winds
flooding concerns are particularly acute for manila the national capital whose metropolitan region is home to nearly twelve million people
because of the area's geography many parts of manila are susceptible to flash floods
hagupit passed to the south of manila late monday and early tuesday over the province of batangas
humanitarian workers were also facing challenges coping with the sheer number of people relying on evacuation centers for support
health issues are kind of difficult when you have nine hundred thousand people crammed into rescue centers gordon said raising concerns about sanitation and respiratory illnesses in particular
philippines gets more than its share of disasters

a woman who allegedly stabbed a u.s. teacher at a mall in the united arab emirates committed a personal terrorist act an official told the nation's official news agency
the official said she logged on to terrorist websites recently according to the wam news agency
the suspect who has not been identified is accused of killing forty seven year old american teacher ibolya ryan last week in the restroom of an upscale mall in abu dhabi
the accused is a female emirati national of yemeni descent the uae's interior ministry said
police say they think ryan who was the mother of three children did not know the attacker
her death came two months after the u.s. embassy in abu dhabi issued a statement warning u.s. citizens of an anonymous internet post that encouraged attacks against teachers at american and other international schools
the embassy said it was unaware of any specific credible threat at that time
ryan was born in romania and had american and hungarian citizenship
she had been a teacher for seventeen years according to a footprints recruiting profile of her
last year she began teaching in abu dhabi where she lived with her children
before that she taught special education in her ex husband's native colorado
surveillance video released by police shows the moments before and after the mall stabbing
a veiled figure police identified as the attacker walks calmly through a parking lot entrance speaks to security guards and picks up a paper before disappearing around a corner and out of sight
the video later shows the suspect running to an elevator and leaving the mall through the same parking lot doors
reem island where the attack occurred is a newly developed area popular with expatriates in the capital
the motive of the killing was still unclear
ryan's ex husband said he was shocked by the fatal stabbing but still feels safe in the uae
i'm totally horrified by what happened paul ryan said
one just needs to look at the video the images of that bathroom and it knocks you out
it knocks you out
but he said uae authorities have gone out of their way to ensure his family is taken care of and have offered to pay for his three children's education through college
they are treating me like family now he said
they have expressed almost precisely in these terms the children will not have to worry about their education for their entire education basically
ryan could ultimately have the power to commute a death sentence if the suspect is found guilty and given capital punishment
under uae law the victim's family must give their consent in order for a death sentence to be commuted
the burden weighs heavily on him he said
as far as i can tell it seems pretty damning evidence and she confessed herself ryan said
ibolya my dear ex wife and i do mean that will not have died in vain

ezequiel mora's voice trembled as he revealed the news
investigators used dna testing from a bone fragment to confirm that they'd found his nineteen year old son's remains in a plastic bag he told cnn en espaol
they gave me the news that my son is now
he is now dead mora said
alexander mora venancio the youngest of eight siblings was one of forty three students from a rural teacher's college in mexico's guerrero state who went missing on september twenty six
authorities have said they believe the students remains were burned at a landfill then placed inside plastic bags and thrown into a river
but so far alexander mora's remains are the only ones that have been identified
for weeks his family has been pushing for answers about the students whereabouts
alexander's friends from school have donated money to help them as they wait for a response his father told cnnmexico
everyone comes and gives me their support
but now no one is going to return him to me he said
federal authorities say they heard confessions from drug traffickers indicating that the college students were rounded up on the orders of a local mayor and then delivered to the drug gang to be murdered
mounting fury over government officials response to and possible role in the students disappearance has fueled demonstrations across the country
at a protest in mexico city on saturday night a group of parents said the search for the rest of the group is not over despite the announcement
my son wherever you are i'll keep looking for you even if my heart is breaking by the news one father said
felipe de la cruz a spokesman for the students families said they received confirmation of alexander mora's death friday from argentine forensic experts who are working on behalf of the families
but he said the families still believe the remaining students are alive
if these murderers think that with a dna match of one of our boys we are going to stop and cry we want to tell them that they have been mistaken that after today this day of action will continue until we find the remaining forty two alive he said
at a news conference sunday mexican attorney general jess murillo karam confirmed that alexander mora's remains had been found
he showed images of the garbage dump and the river read from a detailed dna analysis from scientists at austria's innsbruck university and vowed that the investigation would keep going
based on my own conviction and the orders of the president we're going to continue with this investigation until we detain all the culprits murillo said
so far forty four police officers have been arrested inthe case and authorities are searching for sixteen others he said
authorities have accused iguala mayor jose luis abarca of being the probable mastermind in the students disappearance
he's been charged with six counts of aggravated homicide and one count of attempted homicide and is now being held in a federal prison authorities said
in all at least eighty people have been arrested in the disappearances and the deaths and the governor of guerrero has taken a leave of absence amid scorching criticism that he responded too slowly to what's been called one of the most serious human rights abuses in recent latin american history
families of the missing students have said for weeks that they don't accept the official version and demand proof of what happened
this weekend alexander mora's cousin told cnn en espaol that she was unconvinced by the dna match
i don't believe he's dead she said
what about the rest of them 
i feel like they're just deceiving us

planes believed to be israeli struck inside syria on sunday the syrian government and an opposition group said but the two entities differed over whether the targets belonged to the syrian military
the state run syrian arab news agency characterized the strikes as a flagrant attack on syria targeting two safe areas in damascus countryside in dimas and near damascus international airport
there were no casualties sana reported
but a london based opposition group the syrian observatory for human rights said warplanes believed to be israeli struck a military area in dimas a damascus suburb
the airport target was an import and export warehouse and it was not clear whether the warehouse contained weapons sohr said
there were at least ten explosions heard in the area and it is not known at this moment if there are any injuries as a result of these two raids the sohr statement said
the syrian army released a statement saying the strikes caused material damage to some facilities and reiterating the sana claim that the targets were civilian
this attack proves israel's direct involvement in supporting terrorists in syria against which the armed forces achieved significant victories in deir ezzor aleppo and other areas the statement said
the general command asserted that such acts of aggression will not dissuade it from continuing its war on terrorism in all its forms across the entirety of syria
u.s. options in syria shrivel as islamists and assad regime make gains
israel did not immediately respond to the claim but has declined in the past to comment on what it calls foreign reports
the government of syria's president bashar al assad is engaged in a long running civil war which has seen some conflict spill over into neighboring countries
in march after a bomb injured four israeli paratroopers in the golan heights israeli forces responded with artillery fire aimed at syrian military targets across the frontier the idf said
israel then followed up with airstrikes
we will not tolerate any violation of our sovereignty and attacks against our soldiers and civilians and we will act unwaveringly and with strength against all those that are acting against us at every time and every place israeli defense minister moshe ya'alon said
we see the assad regime as responsible for what is going on in its territory and if it continues to cooperate with terror organizations that are trying to attack israel we will continue to extract a heavy price from him in a way which will make him regret his actions
in october two thousand and thirteen israeli warplanes struck a military base near the syrian port city of latakia an obama administration official told cnn
the target according to the official was missiles and related equipment the israelis feared might be transferred to the lebanon based militant group hezbollah
the official declined to be identified because of the sensitive nature of the information
asked for comment on that strike an israel defense forces spokeswoman told cnn we don't refer to foreign reports

a judge threw out a high profile murder case monday against shrien dewani who was accused of killing his wife while they were on their honeymoon in south africa
judge jeanette traverso called the state's case weak and said evidence fell far below the standard needed for conviction
it took years for prosecutors to bring him to trial over the killing of his wife anni
dewani thirty four was accused of hiring hit men to kill her in cape town in november two thousand and ten
he has repeatedly denied orchestrating the killing pleading not guilty at the start of the trial in october
south african authorities were locked in a three year court battle to get dewani extradited from the uk to face trial
but after the prosecution put forward its witnesses the defense sought to have the charges dropped citing a lack of evidence
traverso found there was no reasonable chance a court would convict dewani unless he took the stand and incriminated himself cnn legal analyst kelly phelps said monday
other witnesses contradicted each other and could not be taken at face value because they were accomplices to the killing of anni dewani phelps explained
she said it was likely that the judge's decision would be the end of the case because the prosecution can only appeal if the judge erred on a matter of law
addressing reporters outside the court national prosecuting authority spokesman nathi mncube referred to a lack of understanding in the case
firstly we have three people who have been convicted in this case ideally you would want to have all conspirators all tried together at the same time but unfortunately that could not happen not because of the npa or anyone else but because of the fact that we could not extradite mr. dewani in time so that he could be tried with the other three accused mncube said
the killing took place during a taxi ride through a township on the edge of cape town just over two weeks after the couple's wedding
the taxi driver zola tongo confessed within weeks of the bride's death that he had hired two men to kill her
in a plea deal with south african authorities he said dewani paid him to carry out the killing and to make it look as though the couple were the victims of a carjacking
tongo was subsequently sentenced to eighteen years in prison for his part in the killing
his two accomplices also received lengthy sentences for their role in the crime
one of them died of brain cancer in october the guardian reported
dewani a care home owner returned to the united kingdom after his wife's death
he avoided extradition to south africa on mental health grounds during a lengthy court battle but he was eventually sent back in april to face trial
psychiatric experts said that he was suffering from post traumatic stress disorder and depression and that he'd tried to take his life
before his extradition he was held at a secure mental health unit in southwest england
but in august he was declared fit to stand trial after undergoing psychiatric observation according to south african media
an indictment in the case said he faced charges including conspiracy to commit kidnapping robbery with aggravating circumstances murder and kidnapping the south african press association reported
dewani from bristol in southwest england said his wife was the victim of a carjacking and denied any involvement in the killing

legazpi philippines typhoon hagupit lost some strength as it spiraled northwest through the philippines on sunday but its hulking presence threatened more damage and evoked frightening memories thirteen months after deadly typhoon haiyan blasted the same region
last year many people were asking is it the will of god or the wrath of god 
but now they just feel it is part of nature the rev
eliodoro reteracion of tacloban's redemptorist church said
while haiyan killed more than six thousand people the philippine government is blaming only two deaths on hagupit so far
on monday morning the storm weakened further and was downgraded to a tropical storm by the u.s. military's joint typhoon warning center
one year old thea rojo and ernesto baylon fifty five both of iloilo province in the central philippines died from hypothermia in the storm national disaster risk reduction council executive director alexander pama told a press briefing on sunday
more than nine hundred thousand people from nearly two hundred thousand families have been adversely affected by the cyclone locally known as ruby pama said
almost all of them have sought help at evacuation centers
cnn meteorologist michael guy forecast that hagupit would move west on monday just south of the capital city of manila with strong winds and potentially devastating rains
the storm which has battered several regions of the philippines since saturday poses dangers of flooding and landslides from a volcano
a day after hagupit made landfall on samar island the massive cyclone crept across the country sunday at about fifteen kph
that sluggish pace means hagupit had more time to dump relentless rainfall over the same areas making severe flooding a possibility
what's worse
the storm passed not far from the mayon volcano
officials are now keeping an eye on the volcano known for its almost perfectly symmetrical cone shape because heavy rainfall could mix with the volcanic ash and spur major landslides
not only could the force of a landslide wreak havoc on homes the debris could go into streams rivers and reservoirs around the volcano blocking them up and causing even more flooding
about forty million people are close to the path of the storm and its fierce winds which reached one hundred and sixty kph sunday
lucrecia simbajon of magallanes is one of those who evacuated to a local church
i don't know how long i'm going to be here as the roof was blown off my house last night she said sunday morning
her home a typical wooden and metal shack was already wiped out last year
after typhoon haiyan she spent more than twenty days at the church lying between pews with her children
despite the potential danger some residents in legazpi in the shadow of the mayon volcano ignored evacuation orders and vowed to stay in their makeshift beachside homes
i think we can handle the situation one man said
if or when it gets worse we'll go to the evacuation center
a woman who lives on the coast was also defiant
we've been here twenty five years and seen many typhoons she said
this one already feels stronger than typhoon haiyan but we won't leave yet
gen. gregorio catapang chief of staff of armed forces said sunday that soldiers were working to clear roads and airports so that emergency services could be delivered
eleven nations had offered assistance including australia the united states china japan and the united kingdom
hagupit should be even weaker by the time it passes near manila on monday evening
the biggest threat in the capital will come from the heavy rainfall
that likely will lead to flash flooding and mudslides even in places far from the storm's center
several airports were closed sunday leading to one hundred and eighty five domestic flight cancellations pama said
once debris is cleared from some of those airports the philippine military will fly c one hundred and thirty planes from manila and cebu to affected areas with necessary supplies he added
flooding landslides and fallen trees are hampering government efforts to drive relief essentials to affected areas
our emphasis now is road clearing operations pama said
don't worry if you are thinking we're out of supply
it will come soon
there may be delay due to roads that are not passable he said
in tacloban the streets were empty because residents had already evacuated
last year super typhoon haiyan devastated tacloban killing more than six thousand people and leaving two hundred thousand people homeless
many people in tacloban are still living in tents or other rudimentary structures more than a year after haiyan
at least one hundred thousand people evacuated tacloban before typhoon hagupit struck the u.n. humanitarian agency ocha philippines said
that's half the population of the city
mayor alfred romualdez told cnn the city is without power but he's seen only minor damage such as broken windows and downed trees
many roads were flooded but not impassable
there was a lot of preparation ocha spokeswoman orla fagan said
i think that the lessons learned were very hard ones in tacloban
because there were so many lives lost and i think they've really taken cognizance this time and really made an all out effort everywhere to bring people to safety
philippines gets more than its share of disasters

a veiled woman attacked ibolya ryan forty seven on monday in a restroom of a high end mall in abu dhabi
she was killed with a sharp object during a fight in the women's restroom local authorities said
police later arrested a female emirati national of yemeni descent whom they described as a suspect
paul ryan arrived in abu dhabi last week to be reunited with his eleven year old twin boys
he also has a thirteen year old daughter
i'm still fearful of all of that he said referring to his ex wife's attack
however i have come to feel it is quite different
i'm starting to believe what my ex wife was always telling me that it's safe
they are treating me like family now

they are treating me like family now he said

ryan has the power to commute the death sentence and grant a pardon if the suspect is found guilty and handed capital punishment
the burden weighs heavily on him he said
i can't believe i have the power to pardon that is shocking to me
i don't want this responsibility he said
as far as i can tell it seems pretty damning evidence and she confessed herself
ibolya my dear ex wife and i do mean that will not have died in vain

editor's note
peter bergen is cnn's national security analyst a vice president at new america and professor of practice at arizona state university
he is the author of manhunt
the ten year search for bin laden from nine eleven to abbottabad
in august two thousand and eight najibullah zazi an afghan american and two friends from his high school in queens flew from newark new jersey to peshawar pakistan where they hoped to join the taliban
in peshawar the trio met with ahmad an al qaeda operative who put them in touch with two al qaeda leaders
those leaders asked the three from queens to participate in attacks against the united states
zazi refused
he wanted to fight the u.s. military in the fields and mountains of his homeland not to kill american civilians in the streets of his adopted country
so according to american prosecutors al qaeda's leaders brought in someone more persuasive someone who could speak to zazi in his own language someone who had also grown up on the streets of new york city in the one thousand nine hundred and ninety s a man who had had a meteoric rise in the ranks of al qaeda over the past decade from camp dishwasher to the leader of the group's operations in the west
his name was adnan shukrijumah
eventually shukrijumah would be added to the fbi's most wanted terrorists list and a five million dollar reward would be put on his head
and on saturday shukrijumah was killed in pakistan by the pakistani military
shukrijumah was born in saudi arabia in one thousand nine hundred and seventy five but his family moved to trinidad in the eighties and then to brooklyn in the early nineties
in one thousand nine hundred and ninety five shukrijumah's family left new york for the fort lauderdale area in florida where he did odd jobs like selling used cars earning money that he used to pay for his studies in chemistry and computer science at broward community college
some muslim men in florida gave shukrijumah books and videos about the holy wars in kashmir and afghanistan and he was so moved by these stories of holy war that in late one thousand nine hundred and ninety nine he traveled to afghanistan to attend an al qaeda training camp
around this time shukrijumah told his mother that he was opposed to what he considered the excesses of the west such as alcohol and drug abuse as well as the skimpy clothes that women wore in florida
in may two thousand and one he left florida again and by june he was back in afghanistan
shortly after the nine eleven attacks shukrijumah called his mother in florida saying did you hear what happened 
they are putting it on the muslims
his mother advised him not to come back to the states and she said in two thousand and ten he did not contact her again
it was shukrijumah who in late two thousand and eight made the pitch to zazi and his buddies from queens zarein ahmedzay another afghan american and adis medujanin a cab driver of bosnian descent that they could help the cause of holy war best if instead of fighting alongside the taliban's tens of thousands of fighters they went back to the states after their training by al qaeda's bomb makers and launched attacks there
at the time that shukrijumah was making his pitch to the trio from queens the cia drone war in the tribal regions of pakistan was heating up
it was the last six months of president george w. bush's second term and the bush administration had significantly amped up the drone program
angered by the cia drone program zazi agreed to return to the states to launch an attack
he also volunteered to be a suicide bomber as did his two friends
they discussed with shukrijumah potential targets such as the new york stock exchange and times square as well as a walmart store
zazi returned to new york in mid january two thousand and nine
he had been living on the afghan pakistan border for five months during which time he had been in almost continuous contact with members of al qaeda
he was now ready to launch what al qaeda's leadership hoped would be the most lethal terrorist attack in the states since nine eleven
luckily zazi's plan to blow up bombs in the manhattan subway around the time of the eighth anniversary of the nine eleven attacks was detected by u.s. intelligence agencies that were monitoring the email account of a known al qaeda operative in pakistan who was in touch with zazi
zazi and his two friends were arrested before they could carry out the plot
it was shukrijumah who oversaw this plot
after all who better to oversee al qaeda plots to attack the states than someone who had grown up in brooklyn and florida 
a pakistani army spokesman said on twitter on saturday that shukrijumah was killed in south waziristan along pakistan's border with afghanistan
the fact that shukrijumah is now dead makes the united states a little bit safer from al qaeda's plotting
and the fact that shukrijumah was killed in a pakistani military operation is a sign that pakistan continues to expand its operations against militants based on its border with afghanistan in a meaningful way which has long been a demand of the united states
finally shukrijumah's death is indicative of how al qaeda's core organization that launched the nine eleven attacks continues to dwindle in size and capacity because almost all of its leaders are now dead or captured
the elimination of almost all of al qaeda's leaders in pakistan suggests that the once global organization may become just another pakistani based jihadi group with limited or no ability to operate outside of south asia

key al qaeda figure umar farooq was killed in a suspected u.s. drone strike in north waziristan on sunday pakistani intelligence officials told cnn
but the pakistani military denied those reports
there was no drone strike inside pakistan territory today the military said in a statement
farooq who also went by the alias ustad farooq was believed to be in charge of al qaeda's operations in pakistan and afghanistan
he also served as a spokesman for al qaeda
the purported drone strike sunday took place when two missiles struck a compound in datta khel killing farooq and four suspected militants intelligence officials said

police on sunday arrested an uber driver accused of raping a woman in the indian capital authorities said
shiv kumar yadav is in custody in mathura about one hundred and fifty kilometers southeast of new delhi said madhur verma deputy commissioner of police for north delhi
investigators seized the vehicle but weren't immediately able to arrest the suspect who verma said was running here and there
when yadav registered as an uber driver he used his real name but an incorrect address verma said
his address and background unverified
he was not having security badge which is given after police verification verma said
yadhav was acquitted in a previous rape case in two thousand and twelve he said
uber said in a statement that it exclusively partners with registered drivers who have been through the commercial licensing process and who have government identification and state issued permits
police are requesting more information from uber as they try to determine what due diligence was taken before using this driver verma said
yadav was due to appear in court monday as police seek to keep him in custody for further questioning
the alleged victim is a twenty six year old employee of a finance company in gurgaon a new delhi suburb he said
after work friday she had dinner at a friend's apartment before ordering an uber car to take her home verma said
she dozed off in the automobile she told police according to verma
when she woke up the driver had parked the car on a deserted stretch where he assaulted her verma said citing her complaint
the driver then dropped her off near her home threatening her with violence if she told anyone what had happened indian home minister rajnath singh told parliament on monday
the victim called police at one thirty a.m. saturday less than an hour after the attack
uber chief executive travis kalanick said his company would work with the local government to establish clear background checks currently absent in their commercial transportation licensing programs
but verma disputed that assertion saying that background checks are already part of our established practice
in its statement uber called the alleged assault an abhorrent crime and said it had given police the driver's name photo address and vehicle registration along with details of the trip during which the assault allegedly occurred
our thoughts remain with the victim who has shown tremendous courage under the circumstances the company said
we will continue to cooperate fully with law enforcement officials in their investigation to bring this crime to justice
the december two thousand and twelve gang rape and killing of a twenty three year old physiotherapy student in new delhi put the spotlight on sexual assaults in the country of one point two five billion people
four of the six men involved in the attack were sentenced to death and their cases are navigating the appeals process
the crime ignited campaigns to call attention to violent crime targeting women and since then rapes have made headlines all over the country from the districts of moradabad badaun bahraich kushinagar and mumbai
in june three brothers confessed to raping two teenage girls in uttar pradesh state
police said at first that the suspects hanged their victims from a mango tree but an investigation of their deaths concluded late last month that the girls committed suicide
one of the victim's brothers has said he is skeptical of the investigation's findings
last week video emerged of sisters aarti and pooja kumar punching and thrashing three men with a belt while riding a bus in the northern state of haryana
the sisters accused the men of harassing them and told cnn affiliate ibn they hope the video of them fighting back deters other attacks
parents must teach their sons how to behave with women aarti kumar twenty two told the station

the element of surprise was lost in a failed u.s. military raid to rescue two hostages being held by al qaeda militants in yemen a senior defense department official said saturday
american photojournalist luke somers and south african pierre korkie a respected teacher who was to be released on sunday were fatally shot in the compound by a terrorist as the secret mission unfolded a u.s. official said
the relief group gift of the givers which was helping secure korkie's release had recently informed his wife that the waiting is almost over
three days ago we told her pierre will be home for christmas said the group which identified the south african hostage as korkie
we certainly did not mean it in the manner it has unfolded
he was an innocent man a respected teacher korkie's wife yolande said in a video made before his death
u.s. president barack obama ordered friday's mission because there were compelling reasons to believe mr. somers life was in imminent danger defense secretary chuck hagel said
a video of somers pleading for his life was released earlier this week by al qaeda in the arabian peninsula
aqap gave the u.s. three days to comply with unspecified demands
time was running out
arrangements for korkie's release may have been missed by the white house
the obama administration assessed that there were two individuals at the location but did not know one was south african or that negotiations were under way for his release a senior state department official told cnn
korkie and his wife were abducted in may of last year but aqap subsequently let his wife go
on friday a team of local leaders was finalizing arrangements to reunite korkie with his wife and children the relief group said in a statement
the president condemned aqap's killing of the two hostages and explained his decision to authorize the rescue attempt
earlier this week a video released by his terrorist captors announced that luke would be killed within seventy two hours obama said in a statement
i also authorized the rescue of any other hostages held in the same location as luke
secretary of state john kerry said in a statement that the president had received a recommendation to authorize the operation
i also offer my thoughts and prayers to the family of a non u.s. citizen hostage who was also murdered by these terrorists during the rescue operation the statement read
their despair and sorrow at this time are beyond words
south africa's department of international relations and cooperation expressed its deepest condolences to the family and friends of mr korkie for their loss
condolences are also conveyed to the family and loved ones of the deceased american hostage
they lost the element of surprise 
the operation took place friday at five p.m
et a u.s. official told cnn
on thursday the defense department became aware of enough new intelligence about the location of the hostages to stage a rescue mission the official said
a senior defense department official traveling with hagel in afghanistan said that the operation was accelerated because there was intelligence that somers would be killed on saturday morning eastern time
obama and hagel were briefed the next day
two osprey aircraft transported a team of about three dozen u.s. navy seals mainly from seal team six and a combat medical team near the captives location
there were no yemeni forces with the u.s. commandos
the official traveling with hagel said that once the ospreys landed the team had to trek about ten kilometers to the compound
they were discovered about one hundred meters from the location where korkie and somers were being held according to that official
the main part of the assault lasted five to ten minutes
they lost the element of surprise at the last minute as they approached the compound the official said
it was not clear where the kidnappers were when the firefight started but the official said that the u.s. is certain that someone ran back inside the compound and shot korkie and somers after the battle broke out
the official would not specify how it could be certain of that detail
u.s. forces were on the ground for about thirty minutes an official told cnn
they stayed for that length of time because the combat medical team was trying to stabilize the two wounded hostages
according to another official the hostages were loaded onto a plane and flown to a nearby u.s. ship
one of the hostages died before reaching the ship
the other died afterward
drones and fighter jets patrolled overhead during the mission
the u.s. forces that carried out the mission are safe a u.s. defense official said
both the president and kerry praised their valor
the hostages were being kept at a location close to one where u.s. and yemeni forces had carried out a previous raid
this rescue mission was particularly difficult due in part to yemen's sparse population retired lt. col. james reese global affairs analyst for cnn said saturday
reese noted that it would have been difficult for the military to travel a significant distance by air and still maintain the element of surprise in a rescue operation
it has to take precision he said
this is like brain surgery
it was the second such attempt by u.s. forces in two weeks
in the first attempt in november u.s. and yemeni special forces outfitted with night visors embarked on the mission about a few miles from a cave where aqap was holding hostages
a gunbattle ensued and the special forces killed all seven abductors and freed eight hostages
but the militants had separated somers and four more hostages from the group and moved them to another location two days before the raid
this week aqap released a video threatening to kill somers and showing the american photojournalist pleading for his life
a spokesman read a statement saying somers would be killed if washington did not meet the terror group's demands
the spokesman did not name the demands but said the u.s. government knew what they were
somers brother and mother posted a response video to youtube in which they pleaded with the militants to spare him
he is not responsible for any actions that the u.s. government has taken
please understand that we had no prior knowledge of the rescue attempt for luke and we mean no harm to anyone jordan somers said
paula somers thanked his captors for taking good care of him but also asked her son be returned to her alive
please show mercy and give us an opportunity to see our luke again
he is all that we have she said
tik root a former freelance journalist met luke somers when they were both in yemen
of all the people i met in yemen luke is certainly not the person that should have happened to root told cnn
he was passionate about the country its people and he was just a very thoughtful quirky guy
root is now a desk assistant for pbs newshour and he wrote about somers on saturday morning on newshour's website
i didn't know him particularly well but we did cross paths about a dozen times root said
he was really dedicated to yemen

affected by the storm 
send your photos to cnn ireport but please stay safe
a massive typhoon crept across central philippines on sunday sending thousands of people into shelters and pouring heavy rain that heightened the risk of flooding and landslides
typhoon hagupit its name means lash in filipino moved west northwest and targeted the city of legazpi just north of where the storm made landfall on saturday
cnn's saima mohsin reporting from legazpi on sunday said shelters were full as high winds and driving rain battered the city
one of the city's major fears is a storm surge that could reach two four meters
with memories of last year's devastating super typhoon fresh in their minds more than six hundred thousand people had evacuated by saturday morning according to the national disaster risk reduction and management council
about forty million people are in the path of the storm's winds
gen. gregorio catapang chief of staff of armed forces said at a sunday press conference that soldiers were working to clear roads and airports so that emergency services could be delivered
eleven nations had offered assistance including the australia the united states china japan and the united kingdom
cnn meteorologist derek van dam said that the storm is actually breaking up over the land mass of the philippines but will continue to pour heavy rain
he said three hundred and ninety five mm of rain were reported in bororgan in twenty four hours
hagupit is moving slowly on its west northwest track at fifteen kph
at that rate it will take about three days for the storm to travel past the capital manila dumping extreme amounts of rainfall more than a foot in some places as it goes
expected to lose some punch by manila
hagupit should be significantly weaker by the time it reaches manila but winds will still be higher than one hundred kph
the biggest threat in the capital will come from the heavy rainfall
that will lead to flash flooding and mudslides even in places far away from the storm's center
despite the threats of danger a cnn crew in legazpi saw many residents who were ignoring evacuation orders and vowing to stay in their makeshift beachside homes
i think we can handle the situation
if or when it gets worse we'll go to the evacuation center one man said
we've been here twenty five years and seen many typhoons said a woman at the coast
this one already feels stronger than typhoon haiyan but we won't leave yet
the typhoon came ashore on eastern samar island just before ten p.m. with winds of two hundred and five kph the equivalent of a category three hurricane
one city farther south breathed a sigh of relief on sunday
in tacloban the streets were empty because residents had already evacuated
last year super typhoon haiyan devastated tacloban killing more than six thousand people and making around two hundred thousand people homeless
mayor alfred romualdez told cnn the city is without power but he's seen only minor damage with broken windows and trees down
many roads were flooded but not impassable
about forty eight thousand people have moved to evacuation centers he said
there have been no casualties
cnn's asia pacific editor andrew stephens reporting from tacloban said there was no storm surge
the main emotion here is one of relief he said
there was a lot of preparation orla fagan spokeswoman for the united nations humanitarian agency ocha told cnn
i think that the lessons learned were very hard ones in tacloban
because there were so many lives lost and i think they've really taken cognizance this time and really made an all out effort everywhere to bring people to safety
philippines gets more than its share of disasters
cnn's madison park and cnn meteorologist brandon miller contributed to this report

last december five just after seven p.m. south african time i got a text message from one member of nelson mandela's family
it's imminent
and so that's how i knew a great man was taking his final breaths
it's done said the next message from those who were with him at the end
it was nine p.m. and nelson mandela was gone
by that stage we were all in the cnn bureau and ready to go live to tell the world mandela was gone
however i had made a promise to my sources that i would not go to air with any information they gave me about his condition until there were an official announcement by president jacob zuma
the televised address to the nation came just before midnight
it was a long wait but i was so grateful to his family for trusting me with the information those three hours of preparation allowed me the time and space to clear my head
i am a south african a white south african whose country was changed for the better by his visionary leadership
i had my own personal thanks to give for mandela's life
then i had the responsibility of delivering this news to cnn's global audience
that task continued for the next eleven days until he was buried in the rural hills around his boyhood home in qunu eastern cape
the immediate days after mandela's passing created a wonderful celebratory mood in the country strange as it might have seemed to others
for south africans it was the most natural reaction
sadness and mourning had been done already in the months before when he was critically ill. now south africans gave thanks paused in gratefulness and came together in ways that reflected the debt they owed to this one man
white black old young gathered outside his house in johannesburg laying flowers and saying a personal prayer of thanks
it was astounding to watch
the manicured pavement lawns of suburban houghton became like an altar of reflection for a time of hope and reconciliation that seemed like an age away
it was called mandela magic and now that he was gone it felt like the magic that had sustained a battered racist nation would go with him
it was always an ephemeral false even suggestion that mandela saved south africa
south africans did it together he just led them on the right path
still older south africans brought their children some just babies wrapped in blankets to his home in the days after he died
often they dressed the kids up in their best clothes like they were going to church and solemnly walked to the piles of flowers on the sidewalk or loitered by the exterior walls
it was as if a whole generation of south africans wanted their kids to feel and breathe in that last little bit of mandela magic 
there was an important sense of occasion a primal need to be there 
at times i watched families appear quietly outside mandela's home and silently soak up the atmosphere
other times i felt like i was watching worshipers presenting gifts to a deity pushing forward toddlers and young kids to the front of crowds just so their children could be closer to the place where he died
in years to come a new generation of children will be able to say i was there
i said goodbye
mandela's funeral was a measure of the man
i watched from inside the funeral tent and thought how apt it was that his goodbye was both about pageantry and plain speaking
i stood by his casket as it made the final journey and softly said goodbye and thank you as that great man was laid to rest on a simple grass mat as he had wished

china's former top domestic security official zhou yongkang has been arrested as part of a corruption probe the country's state run xinhua news agency reports
zhou who had been one of nine members of china's top decision making body the politburo standing committee before stepping down in late two thousand and twelve was also expelled from the communist party according to xinhua citing a decision made friday at a meeting of the party central committee's political bureau
the decision comes amid a much touted anti corruption campaign launched by president xi jinping one that has already ensnared several men who had once been prominent figures in government and the ruling communist party
corruption is a lightning rod for public discontent across the asian nation which for decades has been run by the communist party
after taking power in late two thousand and twelve xi banned official extravagance from banquets to year end gifts and vowed to target flies and tigers alike in his fight against corruption when describing his resolve to spare no one regardless of position
one of them was gen. xu caihou a former vice chairman of the central military commission which runs the world's largest standing army
xu was expelled from the party and handed over to prosecutors after being found to have accepted bribes xinhua reported in june
like zhou xu was in the politburo before retiring in two thousand and twelve
also this summer xinhua reported on the downfall of su rong a former vice chairman of china's top political advisory body
state media reported that su and his wife profited tremendously through bribes and illegal land deals when he ran the southeastern province of jiangxi
zhou officially got caught up in this campaign in july when the communist party announced it was opening a probe into the retired senior leader for a suspected if then unspecified serious disciplinary violation
according to a statement released saturday by the supreme people's procuratorate or china's prosecutor's office an investigation determined that zhou took advantage of his positions to garner profits for others and accepted huge bribes personally and through his family xinhua reported
he did so to help relatives mistresses and friends leaking party and country secrets while hurting state owned assets according to xinhua
the same report noted that investigators found that zhou had affairs with a number of women trading his power for sex and money
what zhou did completely deviated from the party's nature and mission and seriously violated party discipline xinhua said citing the statement from the procuratorate
his behavior badly undermined the reputation of the party significantly damaged the cause of the party and the people and have yielded serious consequences

the pacific island nation of kiribati may be the first country to disappear under the rising sea levels of climate change

president of kiribati on climate change
it's too late for us
we are drifting over the foundations of the surrendered neighborhoods of tebunginako
the village was once home to more than two hundred households but today it lies beneath several meters of turquoise water
we used to swim out there to see the ships when we were boys
they'd tie them up to the coconut trees just over here explains the mayor pointing enthusiastically as we coast over the remains of his town
locals say tebunginako was once the island's main harbor before the rising sea swallowed its coast
now stumps of dead coconut trees line the lagoon their tips peaking out from the water like little grave stones of a civilization lost

u.n..
invest now or face irreversible effects of climate change
the extreme coastal erosion of tebunginako is becoming increasingly common in kiribati a south pacific nation of thirty three islands strung along the equator
the intergovernmental panel on climate change has identified kiribati as one of the six pacific island countries most threatened by rising sea levels
the report claims that due to coastal erosion and freshwater contamination kiribati could become uninhabitable as early as two thousand and fifty
right now we're experiencing total inundation of areas that previously were not vulnerable to normal tides says andrew teem kiribati's senior adviser on climate change
we're getting something called king tides extremely high tides
these were non existent when i was a boy
a large number of kiribati's citizens are already internally displaced from climate related disasters and many have fled to the capitol island south tarawa
today half of kiribati's population crowds onto south tarawa's tiny crescent of land making it one of the most densely populated areas on earth mirroring the population density of tokyo or london
unless birthrates or internal displacement are curbed the population of south tarawa is expected to double by two thousand and thirty

like any developing island state our population is quite young and developing at a very high rate which already strains our fresh water supply teem explains
climate change and the rising sea exacerbate a problem we already have with regards to our water resources
this week representatives from one hundred and ninety countries will gather in lima peru for the twentieth session of the u.n
climate change conference
the lima conference will lay the groundwork for a climate treaty at the end of two thousand and fifteen for implementation by two thousand and twenty
but for low lying island nations like kiribati these commitments may not materialize soon enough
for communities like tebunginako these treaties are already long overdue
climate change has major implications for our people today not in the future like some other countries explains teem
kiribati's government has pursued various adaptation initiatives over the last decade
these efforts range from employment related migration programs with australia and new zealand to the exploration of man made floating islands
this year kiribati finalized a purchase of a plot of land in fiji that it hopes to use in the future
but the people of kiribati are unwilling to abandon their homes without a fight
in addition to their local efforts they are challenging the root of the problem global carbon emissions at the international level
the government of kiribati along with a coalition of other small island states has been lobbying for binding carbon emissions treaties
they have also supported the concept of climate change reparations or compensation to non industrialized developing countries for the climate related damages caused by the industrialized powers
in the past month breakthroughs were made on both fronts
the united states and china the world's largest emitters of carbon announced plans to cut emissions over the next two decades
at the recent g twenty conference several nations joined president obama in committing billions of dollars to the united nation's green climate fund which will support developing nations in combating the effects of climate change
read
u.s. and china reach historic climate change deal vow to cut emissions
while the government of kiribati welcomed this news the measures are only a first step towards addressing their national needs
environmental groups have criticized the developments calling the measures a drop in the ocean
climate change is something we were not responsible for
if we were responsible for this fate that would be a different story all together responds teem on the issues of climate change reparations and carbon emission cuts
we are very simple people with very simple needs but we do not want to be faced with something that is not entirely of our own doing

as the sun sets in tebunginako the mayor guides us to the shore of the town's two remaining structures a church and a traditional community center known as a maneaba
the tall structures jet out defiantly from the middle of the lagoon fortified only by leaking sandbags and battered seawalls
we struggle to maintain them as a remembrance of tebunginako explains the mayor
these places are important to our people because of their religion and because it was the last place they were all together
when asked about his people's future he clings to their past
we are very scared and we need help he shrugs
we believe in our government and their strong voice to the world but we are still waiting for the world to reply

the downfall of ceausescu the romanian dictator who ran his country for the benefit of himself and his family like a feudal master
today the country is still trying to cope with a legacy that defiled the face of bucharest bankrupted the state and traumatized generations of romanians

irene thirty a chic parliamentary aide gives us the figures and numbers
the building she says is the world's third largest by volume after the aztec pyramid of teotihuacan and the cape canaveral rocket assembly hangar
it uses two hundred and twenty thousand square meters of carpet three thousand five hundred tons of crystal and one million cubic meters of marble
the carpet in the main union hall alone weighs one point five tons
how did this monster come to be 
irene tells us how ceausescu took advantage of a one thousand nine hundred and seventy seven earthquake to raze most of the lower city center of bucharest flattening a hill and changing the course of the dambovita river
everything within an area of four square miles was rebuilt from scratch to match the style of the people's palace
a stadium several hospitals and two dozen churches or synagogues were demolished says irene
only three historic orthodox churches were saved by moving them foundations and all behind large apartment blocks so that they would remain invisible and not spoil his view

on the trail of the blood countess in slovakia
construction involved seven hundred architects and twenty thousand building workers doing three shifts a day plus five thousand army personnel one point five million factory workers and an army of so called volunteers
the palace's union hall features two large spiral staircases that descend to the main entrance to allow ceausescu and his wife elena to make grand synchronized entrances
he was short and touchy about his height says irene so he had the staircases rebuilt twice in order to match his step
every chamber has a perfect echo because when ceausescu wanted something he clapped
and he wanted everyone to know he'd clapped
ceausescu never got to see the building finished
by the time of the revolution in december one thousand nine hundred and eighty nine the building was only two thirds complete
the incoming administration didn't know what to do with it but the romanian economy was so entangled with the palace that it had to be finished
the building was completed in one thousand nine hundred and ninety four and since one thousand nine hundred and ninety six it has housed the romanian senate and chamber of deputies
the ground floor is home to a modern art museum
nevertheless the building which costs a dizzying six million dollar a year to run is still seventy percents empty
after one hour of walking up and down its corridors i had still only seen less than ten percents of it

as the united kingdom continues to enforce sanctions on russia over its actions in ukraine the british museum has announced it is lending one of the controversial elgin marbles to a st. petersburg museum describing it as a marble ambassador of a european ideal
a statue originally from the parthenon in greece will go on display at the hermitage museum on saturday british museum director neil macgregor said in a statement
it is the first time the british museum has loaned one of the elgin marbles to a foreign museum
the british government and other european union and nato nations have imposed sanctions on moscow over russia's annexation of crimea and allegations of continued interference in eastern ukraine
britain's sanctions are not cultural instead targeting russia's financial defense and energy sectors as well as imposing asset bans and travel restrictions on specific individuals
however macgregor's statement did touch upon the issue
the trustees have always believed that such loans must continue between museums in spite of political disagreements between governments macgregor said
it is a position energetically shared by our counterparts in russia
western countries and the ukrainian government in kiev accuse moscow of sending troops and military equipment into eastern ukraine to help pro russian separatists fighting against government forces
russian officials have persistently denied their military is involved
at the g twenty summit in australia last month british prime minister david cameron warned russia to change course over ukraine
otherwise cameron said the relationship that britain has with russia that the european union has with russia the relationship that i hope australia has with russia will be very different
greece has for decades been demanding the return of the sculptures which were acquired by lord elgin between one thousand eight hundred and one and one thousand eight hundred and five bought from him by the british parliament in one thousand eight hundred and sixteen and later presented to the british museum
greek prime minister antonis samaras described the decision to loan the sculpture as a provocation to the greek people
the parthenon and its sculptures have been looted
the value of the sculptures is priceless he said
we greeks identify with our history and culture which can not be fragmented loaned or bestowed
the elgin marbles are a series of sculptures in a frieze that once adorned the upper sections of the parthenon in the greek capital of athens
the sculpture being loaned to russia of the river god ilissos is one of the finest of those to survive from the parthenon the british museum said
describing itself as the most generous lending museum in the world the museum said the loan was part of ongoing exchanges with the hermitage which had requested it to mark the two hundred and fifty th anniversary of its foundation
the british museum is a museum of the world for the world and nothing demonstrates this more than the loan of a parthenon sculpture to the state hermitage museum in st. petersburg to celebrate its two hundred and fifty th anniversary macgregor said
mikhaile piotrovsky director of the state hermitage museum said
i am delighted that this important beautiful and significant sculpture has been lent in celebration of our two museums shared values and will be seen alongside the permanent classical sculptures of the hermitage
the british museum says the statues are part of the world's shared heritage and transcend political boundaries
greece's prime minister said the decision to send the ilissos statue to russia disproved what he said was the british museum's rationale for retaining the marbles
the last until now british doctrine that the parthenon marbles could not be moved is no longer valid as their other argument for the lack of an appropriate space to house them collapsed with the opening of the museum of acropolis samaras said
the parthenon was a temple in ancient athens acropolis citadel built in the five th century b.c
the acropolis museum says the area is believed to have been largely intact until the seventeen th century but after damage in warfare foreign visitors began taking parts of the structure as souvenirs
it was in the nineteen th century that lord elgin removed intact architectural sculptures from the frieze the metopes and the pediments of the building the museum says
the latest acropolis museum building was completed in two thousand and seven and is the place where eventually the parthenon sculptures will be reunited the museum says
it says the parthenon frieze was originally one hundred and sixty meters long
from the entire frieze that survives today fifty meters are in the acropolis museum eighty meters in the british museum one block in the louvre the museum said adding that other fragments are scattered among museums in sicily the vatican germany austria and denmark
earlier this year unesco said it had received a request from greece to mediate in the dispute between greece and britain over the elgin marbles
in october the u.n. agency said it had not yet received a response to an official letter sent to the british government and the british museum

still scarred by last year's devastating super typhoon haiyan residents of the philippines rushed friday to stock up supplies and take cover ahead of another potentially catastrophic storm
super typhoon hagupit known locally as ruby is expected to make landfall saturday evening according to pagasa the philippine atmospheric geophysical and astronomical services administration
it is approaching the philippines from the western pacific ocean and is projected to make landfall on the eastern samar or northern samar province
the storm is expected to skirt north of the city of tacloban which was devastated by haiyan last year
officials in the coastal city of legazpi expect to evacuate an estimated seventy five thousand people ahead of typhoon hagupit mayor noel rosal told cnn on friday
there's a danger that there will be heavy rains for about four hours and i am very very worried at this moment rosal said

the storm lost then regained super typhoon status friday
by friday night it was packing potentially devastating sustained winds of two hundred and forty kilometers per hour with even stronger gusts
most forecasters predict the storm will move northwest through the island nation after landfall passing south of the capital city of manila
pagasa projects that the storm will exit the country on wednesday
hagupit the name used by world meteorological organization means lash in filipino
fears over effects of the storm
with the storm fast approaching authorities are not only worried about the typhoon itself but the effects of the fierce winds possible flooding and storm surge
pagasa warned of intense rainfall warning of rainfall between seven point five and twenty millimeters per hour and rough seas
it also warned of storm surge that could reach up to five meters high
last year haiyan's massive storm surge caught many people off guard as it roared in off the gulf of leyte splintering buildings and tossing large ships onto dry land
tacloban mayor alfred romualdez said they're better prepared this year having learned the lessons of haiyan a year ago
residents are taking the storm warnings very seriously and most people have fled the city he told cnn
the ferocious storm obliterated homes smashed entire neighborhoods into tangled heaps of debris
more than six thousand people were killed last year
multiple domestic flights on local carrier cebu air involving destinations like butuan surigao and tandag on the east coast have been canceled due to weather
many filipinos took to social media to spread warnings urge each other to prepare and pray for the country

his wife graca machel was among attendees at one of the first events of the day
a wreath laying ceremony at his statue in pretoria
during the ceremony she spoke of her husband's legacy and the need to carry it forward
madiba's legacy covers everyone in the country in africa and in the world she said
i was not able to think i was numb 
she called on everyone to tap into his legacy of forgiveness and ensure everything he stood for lives on long after he is gone
machel also mentioned her sorrow at her husband's death and the feeling of emptiness that washed over her
when he left he said i leave you in peace and i want you to live in peace she said
on the day of his passing i was not able to think i was numb
however she said she got solace from knowing her husband is at peace and is with friends who died before him
she mentioned some of his closest friends including oliver tambo with whom mandela operated the nation's first black law firm
looking back i imagine him tall and proud walking and all of them rising to welcome him machel said
the revered statesman emerged from prison in one thousand nine hundred and ninety after twenty seven years in detention to lead south africa out of decades of apartheid
mandela's defiance of white minority rule and incarceration for fighting against segregation focused the world's attention on apartheid the legalized racial segregation enforced by the south african government
in the years leading up to his death he battled various ailments forcing him to retreat to a quiet life and fade from the limelight
despite rare public appearances he held a special place in the nation
in his lifetime he went from a militant freedom fighter to a prisoner to a president to an elder statesman
mandela became the nation's first black president in one thousand nine hundred and ninety four
he retired from the presidency five years later and for many south africans he was simply madiba his traditional clan name
others affectionately called him tata the xhosa word for father
other events marking his memorial include a cricket match between the proteas and the springboks and an interfaith prayer
his foundation will also have a three minute seven second blaring of vuvuzelas and traditional horns followed by three minutes of silence
the six minutes and seven seconds are a symbol of the sixty seven years he spent in public service

blood sweat and tears on the football pitch used to mean a very different thing in sierra leone
in a country where ebola is spreading faster than anywhere else on the planet with around seven thousand reported cases so far each droplet of bodily fluid evokes suspicion
here even a post match handshake is an uneasy encounter
in this fearful new climate football has been banned
and to sports obsessed sierra leoneans the embargo is tantamount to forbidding god
football is like a second religion in sierra leone explained the country's football association president isha johansen
bearing in mind this is a poor country you would have situations where people would rather go without food just so they could buy tickets to a big football match
on sundays the long stretch of sand at lumley beach outside the capital of freetown would usually be filled with thousands of people playing the national sport
that was before the outbreak which has had over one thousand four hundred new cases in the last three weeks alone making sierra leone set to eclipse liberia as the worst affected country on the globe according to the world health organisation
now the national premier league has been suspended
casual kick abouts in the community have dried up
even watching the game in halls and cinemas has come to a standstill
this virus is about sweat blood and interaction said fifty year old johansen when i meet her in an inner city london caf a world away from the devastation back home
and that's football
there's a lot of interaction there's a lot of sweat and blood
beyond the deadly virus itself are the psychological effects on a naturally touchy feely people who love to hug and hold hands said johansen
it's a very strained and difficult place to be in mentally
you have to reprogram yourself
so you find that when people reach out to you it's kind of like argh she says screwing up her elegant face and holding up her hands
i think one of the vital things we've failed to adhere to as a people is not to touch a sick person she says of a disease in which twenty percents of transmissions happen during burials
and that is such basic humanity isn't it 
when someone you love is sick you want to hold that person you want to carry them says the mother of one
but you can't
just over a decade after the civil war which left more than fifty thousand people dead the country is now facing a new invisible enemy
it's not like the war that we've been through whereby you saw the rebels coming said johansen who as a little girl never owned a doll instead playing football with her brothers and their friends
but with ebola you wake up one morning and it's hit a town it's hit another town
for a long time we didn't know the signs we didn't know the symptoms to look out for
indeed what initially appears to be a common cold can quickly escalate into vomiting diarrhea and bleeding both internally and externally
transmission through bodily fluids makes football a ripe setting for infection and last month morocco reneged on hosting the two thousand and fifteen african nations cup due to fears over the spread of the disease
let's just say i wasn't surprised said johansen who is also owner of a premier league club called fc johansen
i think if i was in morocco's position i would be focusing on saving lives and wanting to contain the ebola virus she says with a resigned sigh
coming from sierra leone johansen knows full well what it's like having to beg to play in other countries
her country's players have reportedly suffered humiliating prejudice at away games with opponents refusing to their shake hands and crowds chanting ebola at matches
personally johansen also suffered the most humiliating attacks i have ever endured though rather than ebola she says they related to her gender
as one of only two women to head a national football association in the world johansen says she came under fire in a country where women are still perceived to know their place
in sierra leone football is their all
and you don't see women playing it you don't see women telling them how to do it and you certainly don't see women organizing it says the daughter of one of the founding members of the country's east end lions football club who as a child grew up with footballers constantly walking in and out of her family home
yes horrible things were said about me that i wouldn't want to repeat
very very degrading things and cartoons
bearing in mind that i am a mother and i am somebody's wife and i am somebody's daughter she says about slurs during her campaign for the top job in two thousand and twelve
her coping method has been to switch off from local media and social networks
i don't see it i don't read it she says
i kind of disconnect from that and just stay focused
she believes part of the vitriol has come from her hardline stance on corruption
the fa was in total tatters before i came in she says
we had a bad reputation internally and externally
we had no structures
integrity was at an all time low
there was no discipline
and in a country where football and gambling go hand in hand johansen's zero tolerance was a hard pill to swallow
if people choose to gamble as a recreational pastime well that's up to them she says hands clasped around a mug of mint tea
but you can not have people in high administrative offices participating in gambling or betting
it's a no no
when it comes to corruption allegations at the highest levels of football's international governing body fifa johansen is less willing to talk tough
all these things that are swimming around these controversies is something that i really wouldn't like to get involved in she says
it's really unfortunate and i'm really hoping that fifa can rise above it much sooner than later she says of the organization which this year gave sierra leone's football association seven hundred and fifty thousand dollar plus another fifty thousand dollar towards social projects used for tackling ebola
does that mean johansen will be voting for fifa president sepp blatter in next year's election 
sepp blatter has been very supportive of african nations and trying to build up our football development she says choosing her words carefully
and in that respect i think not just myself but i most african countries will recognize that
for now her main focus is on the virus which has so far claimed over one thousand four hundred lives across the country and silenced its beloved football fields
we're just waiting for that day when they tell us boom
the vaccine is out go and take your jabs she says
every morning we wake up waiting to hear that message
investigation
why women weren't good enough for fifa report



i would never
there's an old saying that our parents give us everything from our bodies to our hair and we have to show obedience to our family
china said on thursday it would end the harvesting of organs from executed prisoners on january one and while the move has been welcomed by human rights groups it's hard to see how china can wean itself from the controversial practice if the views of people like zhou are anything to go by
traditional beliefs regard the body as sacred and it should remain intact after death
what's more even if people are prepared to donate there are fears that their body parts may be traded for profit and end up on the black market
thus making a quick switch from organs supplied by death row inmates to a system based on altruism will be tough without a major shift in attitudes something the head of china's transplant system acknowledges
people have concerns about whether the organs will be allocated in a fair open and just way huang jiefu director of the china organ donation and transplant committee said according to state media
china has one of the world's lowest rates of organ transplants with ten thousand procedures each year
the country launched a voluntary donation scheme in two thousand and ten but between that year and two thousand and thirteen only one thousand four hundred and forty eight people donated organs a drop in the ocean compared with around three hundred thousand people in need of organ transplants each year
and just zero point six people out of every million citizens have signed up to donate their organs when they die
to plug the shortfall china has relied overwhelmingly on organs from death row prisoners
technically their organs can only be used under certain conditions such as if no one collects the body the inmate gives consent or their family agrees to the medical use of the body
however observers both in and outside china have questioned whether prisoners have the free will to give their consent and say it's become an unwritten policy that prisoners organs can be used to ease the shortage
even with the new rules it's likely that death row inmates will still supply organs for transplants
huang said that prisoners will still be qualified to donate but their organs will be registered in a computerized donation system instead of being traded privately according to official english language newspaper china daily
phelim kine deputy director asia division human rights watch in new york says he's extremely skeptical about whether china can really end its reliance on prisoners organs in the foreseeable future
the opacity of china's prison and death penalty system the massive profits in organ peddling and corruption make it near impossible he says
many chinese citizens would be unconvinced about voluntarily signing away their organs even for altruistic
such fears are not unfounded given the flourishing underground trade in organs and even corpses
last month local officials in southern china were found to have bought and sold dead bodies to fulfill cremation quotas in a body snatching scandal across two provinces
and earlier this year authorities jailed a twelve member gang that recruited donors online and smuggled their kidneys by disguising them as seafood shipments
there are tentative signs that attitudes are beginning to change
since the beginning of the year one thousand five hundred people have donated organs more than the total between two thousand and ten and two thousand and thirteen
the government has set up a website to make it easier to become a donor but it's still something that few young people are willing to discuss with their families
surveys have suggested that financial incentives including payment of funeral and medical bills might help
liu teng a twenty four year old audio engineer from beijing says it's something he might consider
i want to help those in need and i feel like it would be a continuation of my life he says

at least ten patients have been left permanently blind following botched cataract surgeries at an illegal medical camp in punjab state india health officials say
the operations were carried out at a free unofficial eye camp at guru nanak charitable hospital ghuman organized by a non government organization amritsar's deputy commissioner ravi bhagat told cnn
sixty two people mostly of them aged over sixty had undergone cataract surgery at the camp held on november four five anil joshi punjab's minister for local bodies medical education and research told cnn
seventeen later complained of severe pain in their eyes he said and had subsequently been treated at an eye clinic at amritsar's government medical college
dr karamjit singh an ent specialist at government medical college who is now working to help the affected patients said that of the seventeen who approached the deputy commissioner with complaints on december three ten were now permanently blind
three patients were receiving treatment one of whom regained their sight while four had left the hospital for personal reasons despite their eyes being in very poor condition
singh said the infections could have been caused unsterilized instruments or eyedrops and it would be very hard to restore sight to those affected
officials have launched an inquiry into the camp and were trying to trace everyone who was operated on so they could be assessed by singh said joshi
medical camps often run by non government organizations are commonplace in india helping to bring healthcare to many poor people in rural areas who would otherwise be deprived of their services
they are usually approved by the department of health and welfare
but bhagat said that no such permissions had been granted to the eye camp and its operations were illegal
he said a police report had been filed against the ngo and the doctors involved on the grounds of negligence and other medical camps in the city had been told to halt operations while their permissions were reviewed
india's health sector has come in for harsh scrutiny in the wake of a rash of recent incidents in surgery camps
earlier this week officials in odisha state announced an investigation after bicycle pumps were used to inflate the abdomens of fifty six women undergoing sterilization surgery at a government run community health center
and last month a surgeon was arrested on charges of negligence and attempted culpable homicide in the deaths of a dozen women who had undergone sterilization operations at a mobile clinic in chhattisgarh

civil police in brazil say one of their helicopters made a startling discovery a huge swastika in the bottom of a swimming pool
one of their helicopters was assisting in a kidnapping investigation this week when officers spotted the symbol on a property in pomerode brazil in the southern state of santa catarina
local authorities say no charges would be filed since the swastika is on private land and they say that the homeowner who was not identified is not promoting nazism
police say the pool has had the swastika for thirteen years
though the swastika is an ancient and sacred symbol for some cultures its recent history has been associated with adolf hitler and the nazi party who adopted it in one thousand nine hundred and twenty
the santa catarina region has a history of european immigration including germans and austrians and hosts a popular oktoberfest in the city of blumenau every year that preserves the customs of their ancestors from germany to form colonies in the south
after world war two nazi hunters tracked down franz stangl in sao paulo brazil
he was the commandant of the sobibor and treblinka extermination camps in poland
he was arrested by brazilian police in in one thousand nine hundred and sixty seven and died in a german prison in one thousand nine hundred and seventy one

with one four hour flight friday the new spacecraft series that nasa hopes will take astronauts to mars passed its first test above earth
nasa's orion capsule part of america's bid to take crews beyond low earth orbit for the first time since the apollo missions splashed down in the pacific ocean on friday morning after lapping the planet twice on an uncrewed test flight
the cone shaped craft slowed by a series of parachutes settled onto the water at eight twenty nine a.m. pt about six hundred miles southwest of san diego
america has driven a golden spike as it crosses a bridge into the future a nasa announcer said as the capsule bobbed on the ocean's surface during the agency's tv broadcast of the event
the flight took orion farther from earth than any craft designed for human flight since the apollo seventeen mission to the moon in one thousand nine hundred and seventy two a confidence builder for a program that nasa hopes will take its first human crew into space in two thousand and twenty one
it appears that orion and the delta iv heavy were nearly flawless program manager mark geyer told reporters
orion a crew module designed to carry up to six astronauts soared into the florida sky at seven five a.m
et from cape canaveral atop a delta iv heavy rocket
the assembly shed its boosters before the rocket's second stage lifted orion into low earth orbit in minutes
two hours later a milestone
the second stage lifted orion higher for its second orbit about three thousand six hundred miles above earth or fifteen times higher than the international space station
a human rated system hasn't gone that far since one thousand nine hundred and seventy two.
that reminded us that here we are again now the united states leading exploration out into the solar system geyer said
after the splashdown crews from two navy recovery ships were working to collect the craft
it was a crucial test for the capsule
nasa wants to prove flight and re entry abilities before it carries astronauts
the orion crew module which looks like a throwback to the apollo era but roomier could take astronauts back to the moon but also far beyond
one of orion's tasks might be to send astronauts to an asteroid perhaps one that nasa would first robotically redirect to orbit around the moon
nasa says it hopes that orion pushed by a more powerful rocket system under development will send astronauts to an asteroid in the two thousand and twenty s
nasa hopes orion later will send astronauts to mars moons and eventually to the red planet itself
while nasa focuses on deeper space private space companies such as spacex are expected to take over the space shuttles old job of ferrying astronauts and supplies to the international space station in low earth orbit
when it becomes fully operational orion's crew module will be able to carry four people on a twenty one day mission into deep space or six astronauts for shorter missions
by comparison the apollo crew modules held three astronauts and were in space for six to twelve days
orion's crew module is sixteen point five feet in diameter and apollo was twelve point eight feet in diameter nasa said
friday's launch came a day after nasa scrubbed its first attempt because of a failure of some valves in the boosters to close
those valves which allow fuel to flow into the boosters before launch are supposed to close just before liftoff
engineers and scientists will examine all sorts of data including those collected by on board recorders to determine how well the capsule performed friday
this includes how well the heat shield which keeps the capsule from burning up on re entry held up
we know it worked geyer said but the specifics of how well
will take time to investigate
though orion's first flight didn't have people on it it didn't go up empty
it carried the names of more than a million people packed on a dime sized microchip
sesame street sent up some mementos to inspire students about spaceflight including cookie monster's cookie and ernie's rubber ducky
also aboard
an oxygen hose from an apollo eleven lunar spacesuit and a small sample of lunar soil
a tyrannosaurus rex fossil from the denver science museum made the trip and lockers were filled with flags coins patches poetry and music




one salient fact stands out
they have given up on hospitals inside the city
yes the lightly wounded are treated by the handful of doctors who remain but since a huge car bomb near the official border crossing with turkey obliterated their main hospital they send the injured straight to the border
another hospital would just be another possible target for isis
in the past the kurds battling the militant islamists for control of the border city have claimed as many as ten thousand civilians remain inside
during our two days there we saw little to justify that large a figure
there are civilians here but they eke out a life in the rubble seeking food and fuel as winter looms and likely number in the low thousands
there are civilians here who refuse to flee or can not
turkey has closed the western crossing point through which many refugees left indeed many stand there now trying to get out looking at the turkish soldiers to help
those inside however are besieged increasingly by isis from all fronts
nothing can protect them from the indiscriminate constant shelling
isis forces routinely use homemade mortars
gas canisters packed with shreds of scrap metal
they rain down on the kurdish civilian areas where fighters also mix
u.s. options in syria shrivel as assad islamist forces make gains
yousuf who is twelve lists the friends who have left kobani
he also shows us what they do to protect themselves when the blasts begin
there is no shelter just a room in their house where their uncle told them to run
they show us the cushions they use to hide
some line the walls others they put on top of them
were this a game it would not have any rules
ali is sixty years old and a week earlier lost one of his six daughters
she was seven years old
he walks us to the spot where the mortar hit her
three to four mortars fell near us
the first mortar we escaped from
the second mortar we escaped from
the third fell on us
he is interrupted by the thud of another mortar landing some streets away
my daughter was seven years old
seven years old and she died
god bless help us
they could not flee
the one hundred and fifty sheep he tends are their livelihood as is the family car they did not want to abandon
the animals stand helpless too near the spot where ali's daughter died
ali and his family moved here when isis attacked their village fifteen kilometers from kobani
ali must live with these decisions
the day before he sat at his daughter's grave for a half hour
he kisses her photograph
she was seven years old
she was so beautiful
small
people who saw her felt the need to lift her up and down in play
the graveyard on the city's outskirts also is a somber scene
it too is makeshift
rubble bits of cinder block are used as headstones
next to the fresh graves lies a long trench ready for the next wave of dead
it too is the scene of children playing clambering around the trench
the conflict's brutality may be beyond their reach but the fight for kobani will decide what kind of life they could be left with if they survive

conditions in indian sterilization clinics are under renewed scrutiny after a doctor was removed from his job for using a bicycle pump to inflate women's abdomens during the procedure
health officials in odisha state have launched an investigation after reports that bicycle pumps were used on fifty six women undergoing sterilization surgery at a government run community health center in banarpal angul district friday
the physician was identified as dr. mahesh chandra rout a retired surgeon who carried out work when required for the clinic said odisha health secretary arti ahuja
she said he would no longer be called on to work for the clinic and could face charges as a result of the inquiry
when contacted by cnn rout refused to comment
ahuja said the medical equipment that should have been used in the procedure a carbon dioxode insufflator had been provided to the clinic and investigators would try to determine why it was not used
but sachin ramachandra a health official in the district where the procedures took place said inquiries revealed the insufflator was missing which is why the bicycle pump had been used instead
a health official who did not wish to be named told cnn that the use of bicycle pumps in sterilization surgery was widespread
in the wake of the incident state health officials issued a directive that all sterilizations must be carried out according to correct protocols
in sterilization surgery the patient's abdomen needs to be inflated to allow room to move surgical instruments
dr. naresh trehan the chief medical officer at the medanta medical institute in new delhi told cnn that using a carbon dioxide insufflator allows a doctor to measure and calibrate the amount of pressure placed on the abdomen
using a bicycle pump a method trehan said he was alarmed to hear about is highly dangerous
if you use a bicycle pump you don't know how much air you're pumping in and you might burst the abdomen he said
dr. vidhyadhar sahu the chief medical officer for angul district said none of the fifty six women who underwent surgery on friday reported any problems
for decades in a bid to curb population growth the indian government has run a nationwide sterilization program
particularly in poorer rural areas where access to other forms of contraception is limited sterilization is a popular option
women are paid to have the operations and doctors are given incentives to perform them
but health advocates claim that conditions at the mobile clinics where the procedures are often performed known as sterilization camps are sometimes unsanitary and dangerous
last month a surgeon was arrested on charges of negligence and attempted culpable homicide in the deaths of a dozen women who had undergone sterilization operations at a mobile clinic in chhattisgarh one of india's most impoverished states which borders odisha
dr. r. k. gupta assisted by a team of fellow medical professionals operated on eighty three women in a span of six hours including twelve who subsequently died
government guidelines stipulate doctors should conduct no more than thirty sterilization surgeries a day
gupta blamed the deaths on drugs given to the women after the surgeries
kerry mcbroom a new delhi based advocate with the human rights law network told cnn at the time of the deaths that they were almost inevitable
given the unsafe unethical and unhygienic conditions that persist throughout india in these camps
you might find that there is no electricity there is no running water there is not enough staff in these facilities she said

more than a week after a raid on an al qaeda stronghold in yemen to free hostages an american captive who was not rescued appears in a video begging into the camera for his life
in the recording recently posted by al qaeda in the arabian peninsula also known as aqap the terror group threatens to kill luke somers if washington does not meet its demands
aqap member nasser bin ali al ansi who reads a statement does not say what the demands are but claims that the u.s. government knows them
somers also gives a short statement asking for help and identifying himself
my name is luke somers
i'm thirty three years old
i was born in england but i carry american citizenship and have lived in america for most of my life he says
somers a photojournalist fell into the hands of kidnappers in september last year
he missed being saved in a raid last week by u.s. and yemini special forces that freed eight hostages
the raid was planned after al qaeda militants were spotted transferring the hostages into pickups chained and covered in blankets according to a website associated with yemen's defense ministry
militants drove them to a cave over sixty five miles away from the town of hajir al saiyer
u.s. and yemeni special forces outfitted with night visors embarked on the mission about four miles from the cave
they encountered the kidnappers nearby
a gun battle ensued and the forces killed all seven abductors
they also freed eight chained up hostages who told them that militants had moved five more hostages including somers to another location
the yemeni account did not mention the u.s. special forces but a u.s. official confirmed their participation
cnn at the request of the government delayed reporting the information about the raid so as not to endanger the search for somers and the other hostages at that time

an emirati woman arrested on suspicion of fatally stabbing a u.s. teacher in a bathroom at a united arab emirates mall also is accused of placing a handmade bomb in front of an american doctor's house the country's interior minister said thursday
police arrested the woman identified only as in her thirty s and a uae national interior minister sheikh saif bin zayed al nahyan said
more details about the arrest weren't immediately available
according to a diplomatic source the woman arrested was of yemeni origin and had traveled back and forth to yemen multiple times
the woman was arrested about forty eight hours after the attack
she is being interrogated by emirati authorities and the investigation into the incident is ongoing the source said
police said a veiled woman stabbed american schoolteacher ibolya ryan forty seven during a fight in a restroom at the high end boutik mall on reem island on monday
the alleged attacker was fully covered donning an abaya a black full length gown traditionally worn by emirati women black gloves a face cover and a hijab or head scarf police said
she fled the mall after the attack
police believe ryan who was the mother of three children did not know the attacker al nahyan said
the u.s. embassy in abu dhabi issued a statement back in october warning u.s. citizens of an anonymous internet post that encouraged attacks against teachers at american and other international schools
the embassy was unaware of any specific credible threat at that time but called on citizens to be vigilant about their personal security
just a few months after her arrival in abu dhabi ryan offered enthusiastic advice to other teachers considering working abroad
i would say be positive open minded flexible and take every challenge as a learning experience she wrote on the website of footprints recruiting which placed her in abu dhabi
also be thankful that you are able to have the experience of working abroad
i think at the end it makes you not just learn about others but also about yourself
ryan was born in romania held hungarian and american citizenship and had been a dedicated teacher for seventeen years according to a footprints recruiting profile of her
in september two thousand and thirteen she began teaching in abu dhabi where she lived with her eleven year old twin boys
before that she taught special education students in colorado footprints recruiting ceo ben glickman said
ryan known as iby to her friends was very enthusiastic about the uae and her work at an emirati public school glickman said
she was getting immersed in the culture and talking about learning arabic he said
she thought this was a good experience for her children and she was having a good experience as well
glickman who described her as a compassionate and warm person said employees in the uae were shaken over ryan's death but waiting for the results of the investigation
people obviously want answers but are withholding judgment until we get further information he said
surveillance video released by police shows the moments before and after the mall stabbing
a veiled figure that police identified as the attacker walks calmly in through a parking lot entrance speaking to security guards picking up a paper and disappearing around the corner out of sight
the video later shows the suspect running to an elevator and then leaving the mall through the same parking lot doors
reem island is a newly developed area of abu dhabi where many western expatriates live
later monday the suspect placed a primitive bomb in front of a house where an american muslim doctor lives said al nahyan adding that authorities had video of the event
the doctor's son saw the object and called police al nahyan said
police defused the device
investigators believe that the attacker wanted to create chaos and spread fear al nahyan said
he didn't discuss possible motives beyond that or say what led police to the suspect

nasa will have to wait at least one more day to see how its new orion spacecraft flies
the space agency scrubbed thursday morning's test launch in florida after a series of delays the last of which happened because some liquid oxygen fuel and drain valves failed to open during the countdown nasa said
the launch tentatively has been rescheduled for seven five a.m
et friday
the launch of orion a craft designed to eventually explore deep space is to be one of nasa's biggest moments since the shuttle era ended in two thousand and eleven
nasa spent most of thursday morning's nearly two hour launch window trying to work out various obstacles and kinks before scrubbing the launch around nine forty a.m
et
the first delay involved a boat that came too close to the launch area
more delays came because of wind gusts
when the countdown resumed valves failed to open in the boosters eventually leading to the scrubbing
nasa hopes orion will usher in a new era
eventual human exploration of deep space
we haven't had this feeling in awhile since the end of the shuttle program mike sarafin orion flight director at johnson space center said in a preflight briefing on wednesday
orion looks like a throwback to the apollo era but it is roomier and designed to go far beyond the moon
to an asteroid and eventually to mars
it is i think consistent with those the beginning of shuttle and beginning of apollo said mark geyer nasa orion program manager
i think it's in the same category
when it becomes fully operational orion's crew module will be able to carry four people on a twenty one day mission into deep space or six astronauts for shorter missions
by comparison the apollo crew modules held three astronauts and were in space for six to twelve days
orion's crew module is sixteen point five feet in diameter and apollo was twelve point eight feet in diameter nasa said
orion is expected to take up its first crew in two thousand and twenty one
during this test flight orion will climb to an altitude of three thousand six hundred miles and will orbit earth twice
four and half hours later it will splash down in the pacific ocean about six hundred miles off the coast of baja california
two u.s. navy ships the amphibious transport dock ship uss anchorage and the military sealift command rescue and salvage ship usns salvor will help nasa recover the capsule
once in orbit orion should send back some amazing pictures of earth nasa said
if the weather cooperates nasa said a drone will provide a live video feed of the splashdown
though orion's first flight won't have people on it it won't go up empty
it will carry the names of more than a million people packed on a dime sized microchip

in the aftermath of super typhoon haiyan last year roge agujero's family went back to the plot of land near the sea where their house once stood
we did not see anything not even a single post he said
interactive
see the latest satellite and path of the storm
the ferocious storm had obliterated the building where more than a dozen of agujero's family members lived one of thousands of homes destroyed in the area around the philippine city of tacloban
entire neighborhoods were smashed into tangled heaps of debris
more than six thousand people were killed
agujero's family has spent much of the past year rebuilding their house taking pains to make it sturdier than its wooden predecessor by using concrete
the work isn't finished but a new threat is already on the horizon
another powerful storm typhoon hagupit is approaching the philippines from the same part of the western pacific ocean as haiyan did thirteen months ago
on friday morning local time the storm was downgraded from a super typhoon to a typhoon but is still packing potentially devastating winds
for residents of tacloban and the surrounding region the parallels between the two storms are deeply unsettling
i'm more than nervous because i have experienced what yolanda brought twenty three year old agujero said using the filipino name for haiyan
i don't know what will happen next after another super typhoon
life in tacloban's danger zones one year on from typhoon haiyan
it's not yet clear exactly what path hagupit will take
some forecasts have it on a similar path to haiyan crashing into the central region around tacloban over the weekend
national authorities warn that about forty four provinces may be in hagupit's potential path home to about thirty five million people reported cnn affiliate nine news
typhoon hagupit also know nationally in the philippines as ruby had sustained winds of up to one hundred and forty three miles per hour as of friday morning according to the joint typhoon warning center
the philippines national disaster risk reduction and management council anticipates heavy rainfall from seven point five to twenty millimeters per hour
many local residents around tacloban aren't taking any chances
long lines were reported thursday at supermarkets atms and gas stations as people stocked up on supplies
the local government and relief organizations have begun putting emergency preparation plans into action
unlike last year there are a lot of un agencies and ingo partners on the ground in tacloban and other cities
ready to provide support and assistance said maulid warfa chief of unicef's office in tacloban referring to international non governmental organizations
local people also appear to be more attuned to the potential risks
as haiyan bore down on tacloban last year a lot of residents didn't hear or heed government warnings to relocate from coastal areas
some of them pointed to the blazing sun in the sky the day before the storm hit as proof that there was no need to be concerned agujero said
haiyan's massive storm surge caught many of them in their homes as it roared in off the gulf of leyte splintering buildings and tossing large ships onto dry land
one year after typhoon haiyan
resilience rebuilds the philippines
the sun was high in the sky once more thursday but agujero said nobody trusts it now
he's working for the humanitarian group catholic relief services and has already warned his family whose youngest member is only a month old to evacuate from their half built house near the water in the town of palo to a school building safely inland
his relatives all survived haiyan by taking shelter in a chapel including his octogenarian grandmother who can't walk anymore because of a stroke and had to be carried
but some of them including his brothers and father left it late to get out of the house before it was swept away he said
and agujero himself was hit on the head by falling debris and had to be rescued from the flooded ground floor of a convent where he'd gone to volunteer his help
the lines of communication to carry warnings to residents appear better established than last year
are you there 
share photos video if you can safely
the local government has identified twenty one evacuation centers around the city and has started the evacuation of people already unicef's warfa said adding that the number of evacuation centers is expected to increase
tacloban mayor alfred romualdez whose waterfront house was destroyed by haiyan wasn't available for comment thursday
tens of thousands of people in tacloban are still living in coastal areas designated as danger zones by authorities
officials say a shortage of temporary housing and other problems over the past year have prevented them from permanently relocating most residents of the communities at risk
those areas look set to be vulnerable once again as hagupit known locally as ruby draws near
even in the best case scenario we're going to have very heavy winds and rain that bring the risk of flooding said renee lambert the head of the catholic relief services office in tacloban
the sense of unease among residents was palpable she said with some stores closing and roads appearing quieter
i certainly see the city hunkering down lambert said
the storm is the equivalent of a strong category five hurricane according to the u.s. military's joint typhoon warning center
with hagupit's precise path still uncertain philippine authorities issued storm warnings for fifty six of the country's eighty one provinces covering around seventy percents of the country's population of one hundred million cnn affiliate nine news reported
agujero said he hoped that the tacloban region would be spared this time around
his biggest concern he said was for his family
he was less concerned about their unfinished home
if the house gets destroyed again we can still rebuild it he said

protesters are flooding the streets of new york and elsewhere chanting blocking traffic and demanding change after the decision not to indict in the chokehold death of eric garner
demonstrators staged a die in in brooklyn new york late thursday
they lay in the middle of atlantic avenue
an eerie silence descended as the protesters who had cardboard coffins stopped chanting
the march was being led by three mothers all of whom had lost a son to police
protesters stopped other marchers from getting ahead of the women
they wanted them to walk in front
i'm so happy that people of all cultures all ethnicities came out to show their love and support and basically we have to make a change because they're killing us off a protester told cnn
a part of the brooklyn bridge was closed
protesters marched up broadway and police used pepper spray on the west side highway near houston street
the vast majority of the demonstrations were peaceful
what do we want 
justice
when do we want it 
now
protesters shouted in new york's foley square
garner a black man died in july after a white officer put him in a chokehold on staten island
the case cracked open a wider discussion around policing practices in communities of color
i'm out here because the system has failed us too many times courtney wicker a protester told cnn affiliate ny one
it makes me feel like there's no justice
demonstrations also erupted in boston washington d.c. and chicago where they shut down one of the major roads downtown
robert spriggs twenty two a young protester in washington told cnn
it feels like we're moving backwards so if we have to march like it's the sixties we will
earlier in pittsburgh protesters marched and lay down in the middle of a street
it's happening in every city every town
it's happening here in pittsburgh julia johnson told cnn affiliate wpxi
police are racially profiling people
they are harassing people she said
there is just no accountability and no justice for the victims
the demonstrations raise the question
if the way we police in america is wrong as many suggest then what's right 
that's the problem police and communities now face in the wake of three high profile investigations that collectively have sparked a national conversation around changing the status quo
in ferguson missouri violence and chaos erupted after a different grand jury elected not to indict a white officer for killing a black teenager
a nearly two year investigation by the justice department revealed a pattern of excessive force by police in cleveland
and in new york officials are still in the midst of grappling with what to do in the wake of garner's death
his encounter with officer daniel pantaleo was captured on video
another video shows the dying man lying on the street for more than six minutes as officers calmly wait for an ambulance showing no sign of urgency
fundamental questions are being asked and rightfully so about how we respect peoples rights how we reduce the use of force in the relationship between police and community in each encounter between police and community how we get it right new york mayor bill de blasio said
the mayor said
this tragedy is raising a lot of tough questions
there's tremendous resolve here in this city to answer those questions to get it right
pantaleo may not stand trial in garner's death but he's not off the hook
attorney general eric holder said that the u.s. justice department will conduct an exhaustive and fair civil rights probe into the incident
the new york police department is taking a fresh look at the case as well escalating its internal investigation of garner's death by interviewing more officers
even if it's not illegal the city's police department patrol guide states its officers will not use chokeholds which it defines as any action pressuring the throat or windpipe
whenever it becomes necessary to take a violent or resisting subject into custody responding officers should utilize appropriate tactics in a coordinated effort to overcome resistance the patrol guide says
once this investigation is finished it's possible that a negotiated settlement will be reached or that there will be a department trial
if there's a finding of guilt a decision will be made as to an appropriate penalty or discipline for that said police commissioner william bratton who would decide on the punishment
so who was eric garner 
before his death at the age of forty three he was a father of six as well as a grandfather
he was also someone with a history of run ins with the law including thirty arrests
when police confronted him in july they suspected that he was illegally selling untaxed cigarettes something for which he had previously been arrested
but his family and its supporters can't understand how anyone could think officers actions that day were justified
garner's mother gwen carr wondered how the grand jury which was of mixed race and heard from dozens of police and civilian witnesses between september twenty nine and december three could decide there wasn't probable cause for an indictment after seeing the widely distributed video
and his widow esaw garner was angry that somebody that gets paid to do right did wrong and was not held accountable for it
but my husband's death will not be in vain
as long as i have a breath in my body i will fight the fight til the end she added
battalions of police watching the protesters wore no riot gear wednesday night in new york and refrained from the show of armored vehicles and assault rifles that appeared in the st. louis suburb of ferguson
officers on the lookout for people trying to block traffic for long periods of time ended up arresting eighty three people
bratton pointed out there was no violence no vandalism no looting
this was no accident
garner's family wanted it that way with father ben carr telling a crowd outside the store where his son gasped in the chokehold we ain't tearing up nothing
we ain't burning up nothing
the police is our problem
no violence
that is all i ask
police union says officer just tried to tackle garner
pantaleo offered his condolences to garner's family in a statement
i became a police officer to help people and to protect those who can't protect themselves he said
it is never my intention to harm anyone and i feel very bad about the death of mr. garner
in addition to the internal investigation pantaleo has been the subject of two other lawsuits
in both the plaintiffs allege false arrest unlawful imprisonment civil rights violations and other charges
one suit from two thousand and thirteen was dismissed in january two thousand and fourteen while the second from february two thousand and fourteen remains open
speaking specifically about the garner case bratton said he understood people's anger over the scenes on the video but that he also trusted the legal process and the grand jury's judgment in spite of the images
as much as we think video is the final determinant it is not he said
the grand jury saw much more evidence and argument than the public or he have seen he said
a judge ruled thursday against releasing some of the testimony and evidence presented to jurors one day after the staten island district attorney filed a motion asking for such a release given the public interest in the case
certain facts about the jury however were released
it sat for nine weeks and heard from a fifty witnesses including civilians officers and medical personnel
sixty exhibits were admitted into evidence including four videos
pantaleo's police union defended his tackle with patrolmen's benevolent association president patrick lynch saying it is clear that the officer's intention was to do nothing more than take mr. garner into custody as instructed and that he used the takedown technique that he learned in the academy when mr. garner refused
no police officer starts a shift intending to take another human being's life lynch said

this year is on track to be one of the hottest if not the hottest year on record a u.n. agency reported wednesday citing preliminary estimates
the estimates were released by the world meteorological organization to coincide with annual climate change negotiations taking place in lima peru
what we saw in two thousand and fourteen is consistent with what we expect from a changing climate
record breaking heat combined with torrential rainfall and floods destroyed livelihoods and ruined lives
what is particularly unusual and alarming this year are the high temperatures of vast areas of the ocean surface including in the northern hemisphere said world meteorological organization secretary general michel jarraud
noaa
two thousand and fourteen is shaping up as hottest year on record
according to the organization estimates for this year show the average air temperature over land and sea for january october was about one point zero three degrees fahrenheit above the average of fifty seven point two degrees f for the one thousand nine hundred and sixty one one thousand nine hundred and ninety reference period and zero point one six degree f above the average for the past ten years
if the rest of two thousand and fourteen plays out as expected this year will be the hottest on record ahead of two thousand and ten two thousand and five and one thousand nine hundred and ninety eight
the provisional information for two thousand and fourteen means that fourteen of the fifteen warmest years on record have all occurred in the twenty one st century jarraud said
there is no standstill in global warming

london property and gold the two safest places to put your money or so the saying goes in recent years
for the past several years owners of london property have watched with delight as the values of their homes have spiked annually well into double digits
with gold as has been the case for thousands of years it has provided a tradable commodity which investors have turned to in uncertain times
it's a safe haven the asset of last resort
but with quality gold ore becoming increasingly hard to find a canadian company has ventured one hundred and twenty five kilometers into the arctic circle to build europe's largest gold mine
otherwise known as a place for tourism and skiing the town of kittila in the lapland region of northern finland is an unforgiving environment to run a mining operation
average temperatures in winter usually only reach twenty three degrees fahrenheit
but that hasn't stopped the mining or the growth of the area
that growth is possible because global demand for gold is high said sean boyd president and ceo of toronto based agnico eagle mines which runs kittila's gold mine
read
how you'll manage your money in two thousand and twenty
demand is continuing to grow in a part of the world that's growing population wise and is growing from a wealth perspective said boyd
recent reports from the gold industry development group world gold council show that consumer demand in china has skyrocketed and india and the united states have a big appetite for gold too
while it may be culturally important to own gold in parts of the world boyd also said central banks still feel the need to own it
that's not going to go away
central banks are still buying it
it trades like a currency on most days added boyd
or as a recent wgc report put it
with many economic and geopolitical wounds still open central banks once again sought the protection and diversification of gold
shanghai has built a gold exchange over the last dozen or so years and having just opened it up to international players its goal is to make that the largest physical bullion market in the world
boyd says that's a sign that the market continues to move to the east
read
bitcoin one year on from peak price
logistically however boyd says it's necessary to go further afield to find quality ore deposits
the easy stuff's been found now
you look at the industry average gold grade is a little over one gram per ton and so the gold reports in minute particles and as a result of that you're having to move much more rock than you used to to get the same amount of gold said boyd
it's a laborious process that uses chemicals to extract tiny particles of gold
the kittila mine is expected to remain open until at least two thousand and thirty six as agnico eagle has already discovered the gold reserve is in excess of five million ounces much higher than its original estimate of one point five million ounces
in order to achieve this the company will have to take the mine down at least nine hundred meters below the surface
but one thing is for certain
gold's popularity has not waned
i don't think gold's going to go away i think it still has an important role to play said boyd

first light creeps over chobe national park as i climb groggily into a land rover and head out for an early morning game drive
on any other african safari you would expect to hear the roar of a diesel engine as the hulking vehicle shudders into gear breaking the stillness of dawn
but on this morning our guide lebo starts the landy unnoticed and we glide silently away from the lodge off to see elephants and lions in an almost zen like quietness
i've been to wildlife reserves all over africa but this for me is a first
not only is it kinder to the environment but as i discovered during my stay at chobe game lodge a far better way to see wild animals
in the lodge's converted electric land rover silent and smooth we hear every bird every rustle of the bush
lebo stops so we can take photos of the brilliant orange sunrise
we then continue quietly along listening to the alarm calls of baboons and the chatter of guinea fowl descending from their roost
such an experience is a rare thing indeed
chobe game lodge located inside the national park on botswana's northern border with namibia zambia and zimbabwe launched what it describes as the world's first electric safari fleet in late november
the lodge is rolling out both electric game drive vehicles retrofitted land rovers and electric boats for game viewing cruises along the chobe river
more
animal spotting on world's most luxurious train
the power supply comes from the hydroelectric grid supplied by southern africa's mighty victoria falls
chobe's fleet is being converted to electricity by a south africa based firm called freedom won
the lodge's general manager hit on the idea after reading an article about the company's work
antony english a freedom won co owner says electric vehicles are well suited to game viewing and just so kind to our environment
the converted land rovers are rugged and perform well on chobe's sandy trails
the first vehicle put into operation our ride for the day has been dubbed freedom three
most of you will have been on a game drive and you would have had to put up with the diesel motor and the noise and the vibration and smoke english says
just think about that when you drive freedom three and think about the contrast
chobe is special because of the concentration of game along the riverfront giving visitors the option of both game drives on land and cruises on the water
the national park is also known for its large elephant population with upwards of one hundred and twenty thousand elephants in the chobe area
the best time to visit is during the may to october dry season when animals gather near the river
when the rains come the herds disperse into the bush
the upside is that there are few tourists the downside is scant wild animals to be seen
in front of the chobe game lodge running above the river is a long boardwalk punctuated by seating and viewing areas from which visitors can spot grazing hippos plus warthogs impalas and all sorts of bird life

going wild in denmark's food paradise
it's easy to see why the actress elizabeth taylor fell in love with this place visiting chobe game lodge repeatedly and even marrying richard burton for the second time on the river's edge
the five star lodge's decor has been updated since the one thousand nine hundred and seventy five wedding so perhaps mercifully none of the taylor era feel is preserved
now there's an airy zanzibar inspired design complete with oversized cushions wooden frames and vintage lanterns
most international visitors to chobe will arrive at the small kasane international airport fifteen kilometers from the lodge connecting from either johannesburg in neighboring south africa or from botswana's capital gaborone
both are about a two hour flight away
kasane is probably the only airport in africa to have its own parking bay for electric vehicles a new addition with the lodge intending to use electric land rovers for ferrying guests
day trips are possible from chobe to victoria falls on the zambian zimbabwean border only ninety minutes away
jonathan gibson ceo of the company that owns chobe game lodge and a board member for the national park worries about the growing number of big polluting boats on the chobe river and general crowding in the riverfront area
he and the chobe board want river traffic restricted to electric boats with the exception of fishing boats and local ferries within three years
this is the way to go gibson says
it's going to revolutionize what happens on the river here
on land there are safari vehicle traffic jams mostly polite though some tourists lose the plot
i watched as a khaki clad german visitor screamed at another group of tourists for momentarily blocking his distant view of sleeping lions
as in most other national parks vehicles aren't allowed off the tracks at chobe in order to protect the natural environment

retro safari does dubai's deserts in style
as the only lodge within the national park's boundaries chobe game lodge is well positioned
morning drives and afternoon cruises generally start a half hour early to get a head start on the other tourists
all of the guides are women highly unusual at game lodges across africa
the lodge also offers a more unusual tour
albert ndereki sixty two a longtime employee leads an eco tour that takes guests behind the scenes into the kitchen laundry room and other places a tourist would never normally visit
ndereki proudly explains the process of recycling glass bottles into cement bricks used for building reusing gray water for the garden and shows off the interesting bio gas plant in which food waste is converted into methane gas used for cooking
this is our park ndereki tells us
we have to look after it
on a late afternoon river cruise we experience the sounds of silence again
as our electric boat turns a bend we spot a herd of elephants tentatively coming down to the river for a drink of water
an african fish eagle sits motionless as we glide by
a crocodile basking on the shore's edge doesn't move either until a grumpy elephant decides to chase it away
we sit watching and listening to the elephants as dusk settles over the chobe river
but the next morning is a rude awakening
back to a bumpy old diesel fueled land rover for our final game drive through the park
the lodge's fleet is still being converted to electric and it is a slow process though the plan is to have a total of thirteen game drive vehicles and six boats
our guide catches sight of a jacobin cuckoo and we pull up to get a better look our diesel motor roaring
my seatmate puts down his camera grumbling
it would still be there if we were in the electric vehicle

the first thing you notice is the smell
rich deep and mysterious
and somehow both fresh and musty at the same time
it's a scent that immediately piques your curiosity
cnn's on the road japan team visited japan's oldest whisky distillery just outside kyoto to learn more about a spirit that's just been named the best in the world
just a few weeks ago the yamazaki single malt sherry cask two thousand and thirteen made by beverage giant suntory took home top honors in jim murray's whisky bible
the whisky guru referred to it as near indescribable genius
scotch didn't even make the top three
while japanese whisky has been taking home awards for over a decade this was a first
and standing in the cellar piled high with oak casks some american some spanish and some japanese you get the sense that its rise around the globe has only just begun
suntory's chief blender shinji fukuyo is responsible for every bottle of whisky don't call it scotch he says that leaves the ninety year old distillery
while the scotland trained fukuyo is modest about taking home the top title he is clearly proud of what japanese whisky has achieved
the secret he says is not boldness but balance
perhaps it's the purity of the water which fukuyo says makes a gentle spirit
or maybe it's because the whisky is exposed to japan's dry cold winters and hot humid summers as it matures inside those casks
or maybe it's about the blending
the scotch industry has more than one hundred distilleries there so blenders can choose from each distillery fukuyo points out
but we have only two malt distilleries one grain distillery
that's why we have to make different types of whisky even in one distillery
it's our challenge
suntory's blender won't show us the secret behind his craft but when we ask him how he maintains the quality he gives us a glimpse into the science
formulas of the most popular labels can change up to two dozen times a year fukuyo says because no two casks are exactly the same
change one ingredient in the blend and that precious balance is no more
it's a challenge that seems even more daunting when we learn some products use fifteen or twenty different types of whisky
even single malt contains whisky from about ten casks he says although all from a single distillery to qualify for the single malt moniker
from blending we're on to tasting
if you like your whisky neat well here's the first big surprise with japanese whisky
add water
even if it's just a dash
fukuyo says adding water is a must in order to release the aromas and savor the full flavors
that's because most japanese enjoy drinking whisky with a meal sometimes on the rocks sometimes in a highball glass with soda
so once in the glass the whisky has to hold its character and flavor even while the proof begins to drop
fukuyo confesses he drinks it straight but definitely not without a drop or two of water to open it up
as for that best in the world whisky 
you can't get it in japan fukuyo says
only three thousand bottles were released and they were all exported
while japanese whisky is making headlines whisky culture in the country is distinctly low key
many whisky bars are small with only a dozen or so seats and a solitary bartender
takayuki suzuki the cocktail designer at the park hotel tokyo gives us a first hand look at japanese whisky bar tending skills
suzuki's nickname is mr. ice man and we soon learn why when he sets to work transforming a rough softball sized block of ice into a smooth sphere
fragments fly in every direction as suzuki chips away before he spins his handiwork into a lowball glass pours single malt whisky over the top and then carefully lifts the cube twice with a spoon to release the aromas
japanese whisky has a good balance suzuki says
compared with scotch whisky it does not lose the taste and flavor when you mix it with other drinks
it is easy to use as a cocktail base
so we ask for an old fashioned
and he just looks at us
a different bartender might raise an eyebrow but suzuki is far too polite
which japanese whisky would be best for that we ask
the answer it turns out is none
according to suzuki mixing the spirits with anything but ice water or soda would ruin its purity and balance
but he says of course he'll make one if the customer really wants it
we've learned our lesson
another twelve year yamazaki on the rock please
it's time to relax and enjoy

it was a routine call for the norwegian fighter pilot participating in nato's quick reaction alert mission high in the sky off norway's coast
he was tasked with investigating and identifying an aircraft that had entered the mission's patrol area in international airspace northwest of norway
fluffy clouds dotted the piercing blue atmosphere and it looked like it would be a non eventful mission until something gray darted in front of the norwegian pilot's f sixteen a russian mig fighter according to the norwegian defence ministry
what the hell
is a loose relatively polite translation of what he's heard saying on video released by norwegian military
he was surprised and he expressed it norwegian navy cmdr
gens hoilund told cnn wednesday in a telephone interview
the video appears to be recorded from the norwegian jet's own camera and shows the russian fighter in the lower right quadrant of the shot
the norwegian aircraft then banks sharply to the left to maneuver away from the mig
the encounter took place sometime in the past two years hoilund said
the video was released to show just an example of the kind of situations that our pilots flying the nato qra missions can encounter said capt
brynjar stordal information officer for the national joint headquarters norway in a statement wednesday
we do not know if this incident was caused by the russian pilot miscalculating the distance to the norwegian fighter or if it was an intentional maneuver
there have been a few incidents like this over the years but i would like to press that the majority of the made by norwegian fighters take place without incident stordal's statement added
the russian jet didn't appear to be acting in an aggressive manner hoilund said but it's not clear what it was doing
he came too close but he was not aggressive he said
hoilund explained that a pilot he spoke to not the pilot in the video said it was an unusual situation and that pilot couldn't recall any similar behavior in the recent past
when we observe unknown planes we identify them so it was a normal mission for us to go and identify this plane hoilund said
there was no attempt to make radio contact with the russian jet he said
stordal said it's important to note that norway has not experienced the same increase in russian air activity in its area of responsibility as has been seen by partners in the baltic region
last year we had forty one scrambles and identified fifty eight russian aircraft
as of now the numbers are forty three sixty nine for two thousand and fourteen the ministry statement said
the nato quick reaction alert mission tasks partners with patrolling the skies to identify suspicious aircraft
this enables the alliance to detect track and identify to the greatest extent possible all aerial objects approaching or operating within nato airspace so that violations and infringements can be recognized and the appropriate action taken said a statement on nato's website

the internet is a vast and seemingly limitless space but it's no match for psy
gangnam style the south korean pop star's enduring video phenomenon from two thousand and twelve has surpassed two billion one hundred and forty seven million four hundred and eighty three thousand six hundred and forty seven views on youtube maxing out the site's original view counter
we never thought a video would be watched in numbers greater than a thirty two bit integer but that was before we met psy wrote google which owns youtube in a blog post this week
gangnam style has been viewed so many times we have to upgrade
for anyone who doesn't have an advanced degree in computing that basically means youtube's view counter was based on a thirty two bit integer a unit of data in computer programming languages and the number two billion one hundred and forty seven million four hundred and eighty three thousand six hundred and forty seven is its maximum positive value
when programmers built youtube nine years ago they probably never imagined that a video on the young platform back when several million views was considered a smash hit might be watched more than two point one billion times
as of late wednesday morning gangnam style had breached the barrier showing more than two billion one hundred and fifty two million five hundred and twelve thousand views
so how is this possible 
youtube's software engineers saw the problem coming and recently updated to a sixty four bit view counter across the site google spokesman matt mclernon said
the view counter can now go up to nine quintillion views which should hold psy for a while
nothing actually broke mclernon said
there was never anything that actually went wrong
it's just people having fun with the language
still it's an impressive feat for psy's trademark horse riding dance video which is almost two years old
uploaded in july two thousand and twelve gangnam style was the first clip to hit a billion views and is the most watched video of all time
it was even the no
five most played video on youtube this past summer mclernon said
people still play this video an absurd number of times he said
to commemorate the occasion youtube has added a new wrinkle
if you hover your cursor over the gangnam style view counter the numbers spin backwards and forwards
in two thousand and twelve
gangnam is new youtube king

american couple matthew and grace huang fought the qatari legal system for nearly two years over allegations that they starved their adopted daughter to death
now cleared they have begun their journey home to the united states
the huangs left qatar on a plane wednesday afternoon three days after an appellate court cleared them in the january two thousand and thirteen death of their eight year old daughter family spokesman eric volz said on twitter
thank you to all the silent heroes on this one
wheels are up tweeted volz who works with the international crisis resource group david house agency which helped with the huangs court case in qatar
volz tweeting from the plane also posted a picture of the couple aboard the aircraft
an appeals judge in qatar on sunday cleared the huangs of starving their adopted daughter to death in two thousand and thirteen in a case that drew global attention to that country's justice system
despite the ruling the huangs were blocked from leaving qatar at hamad international airport by immigration officials who confiscated their passports according to the doha news agency which cited volz
diplomatic sources said monday the departure was delayed due only to legal procedures that take place once people have been cleared of a crime
on tuesday u.s
ambassador to qatar dana smith said a travel ban against the couple was lifted following a motion that was filed monday and after talks between smith and top qatari officials
the huangs who were living in qatar while matthew huang worked for an international company that was constructing sites for the two thousand and twenty two world cup were arrested in january two thousand and thirteen when their eight year old daughter gloria died
they were charged with starving her to death convicted in march and sentenced to three years in prison
the qatari prosecutor sought to paint the huangs as inhumane alleging they bought their adopted daughter cheaply from her poverty stricken parents in africa and had threatened to seek human trafficking charges
the couple spent nearly a year in prison before being freed in november two thousand and thirteen to await proceedings surrounding an appeal that they filed
appellate judge abdulrahman al sharafi overturned the conviction on sunday citing weaknesses in forensic reports and saying the trial judge failed to properly consider testimony from witnesses who said gloria wasn't deprived
a report by pathologists hired by the defense obtained by cnn stated they found no evidence that tissue samples were taken from gloria's body after her death despite that qatari investigators submitted an autopsy report
advocates for the huangs suggested the lab report was fabricated and said their request with the qatari judiciary for a formal investigation went unanswered
after the couple's arrest their two sons also adopted from africa were temporarily placed in a qatari orphanage

new elections will probably be held on march seventeen the speaker of israel's parliament said wednesday a day after the prime minister sacked two senior members of his coalition cabinet for criticizing government policy
prime minister benjamin netanyahu also called for parliament to be dissolved a step that the knesset is now considering
lawmakers voted unanimously to dissolve parliament in a preliminary vote wednesday according to the official knesset website
a knesset committee will now prepare a bill for further votes by lawmakers early next week
speaker yuli edelstein said the party heads had agreed on march seventeen as the proposed election date
the upheaval was triggered when netanyahu ordered letters of dismissal for finance minister yair lapid and justice minister tzipi livni two members of his cabinet from rival parties according to a statement from his office tuesday
during the last few weeks and in particular the last few days the ministers have intensely attacked the government that i am leading netanyahu said

i will not tolerate ministers attacking the government's policy and its head from inside the government
the call for new elections means israel is effectively in a state of political paralysis until march
israel held its last election just twenty two months ago
a poll for israel's channel two suggested that fifty five percents of those surveyed were against another election being held so soon
netanyahu will hope that the vote enables him to form a government he can work with including right wing and religious parties but there is no guarantee that he will be able to form the coalition he wants
netanyahu has been prime minister since two thousand and nine
but he's had to rely on members of other parties many of them to the left of likud on the political spectrum such as the centrist parties of livni and lapid to govern
netanyahu is also calculating that he can win a fourth term in office
opinion polls give a mixed picture indicating that many people blame him for the current crisis but that at the same time if elections were held today his right wing likud party would increase its share of seats in the one hundred and twenty seat knesset
however people feel there is a range of problems that are not being dealt with such as a faltering economy recent attacks against israelis in jerusalem and this summer's inconclusive war against hamas militants in gaza
netanyahu told reporters tuesday that a divided government was one of israel's problems saying there was a lot of debate contradictions and ultimatums
he called out livni for meeting with palestinian authority president mahmoud abbas against his advice and for criticizing building in jerusalem which some say has exacerbated tensions with arabs there
and netanyahu lambasted lapid for calling israel's boycott of iranian president hassan rouhani's u.n. speech a mistake and challenging his push to label israel a jewish state which some fear will alienate the country's significant arab population
he also accused the ministers of being behind talks to kick out the prime minister
in one word they call this a putsch netanyahu said
you can not have a government like this
it's impossible to govern like this
in a facebook post tuesday livni said the question in the election will not be who was the first to identify the threats and use them for political means but who will deal with the threats in a responsible level headed manner for the good of the country
lapid's centrist yesh atid party also fired back in a statement in which it said lapid told netanyahu by phone that he expected the prime minister to act responsibly and to stop dragging the and our soldiers into an election for your political needs
yesh atid said that unnecessary elections
will harm the economy and israeli society all for narrow political interests and a surrender to the ultra orthodox parties the powerful central committee of the likud and outside lobby groups

a large explosion outside the residence of the iranian ambassador to yemen killed six people and wounded twelve others in sanaa on wednesday
the newly appointed iranian ambassador hasan nam wadi was not in the building at the time but it's not clear if his family was two interior ministry officials said
all iranian diplomatic personnel were safe and accounted for the tasnim news agency in iran reported
the car bomb went off near the entrance of the diplomatic residence officials said
photos provided to cnn from the scene showed at least two large holes blown in the side of the residence with security forces and others walking over piles of concrete rubble outside
among those killed were a guard at the residence and a woman and her child who were walking by
no group immediately claimed responsibility for the attack though it has the hallmarks of al qaeda officials said
we expect al qaeda to claim responsibility for the attack since they vowed to target and kill houthis and their allies a senior interior ministry official told cnn
houthis are followers of a sect of shia islam
iran is predominantly shiite
the newly appointed ambassador arrived in yemen just days ago and has strong links with the houthis
al qaeda the sunni muslim terrorist network has for months threatened to kill houthis after houthi fighters defeated sunni tribes in several provinces
raid frees eight hostages from al qaeda stronghold u.s. and yemen say

an american woman has died after being stabbed by an unknown attacker in the restroom of a high end mall in abu dhabi the capital of the united arab emirates police said
ibolya ryan forty seven was taken to the hospital after the attack monday on reem island but died of her injuries abu dhabi police said
she worked as a schoolteacher and had eleven year old twins who are being cared for by authorities until their father the victim's ex husband arrives from abroad police said
authorities previously said she was thirty seven
ryan was stabbed with a sharp tool later recovered by police after a fight broke out in the women's restroom according to col. dr. rashid mohammad borshid head of the criminal investigation department of abu dhabi police
the cause of the fight remains unknown
the suspect fled the scene immediately after committing the crime he said
police have appealed for help tracking down the killer
investigations are still under way to identify the suspect's identity and gender a police statement tuesday said
witnesses reported that the culprit was fully covered wearing an abaya black gloves and face cover
the abaya is a black full length gown traditionally worn by local emirati women
the suspect was also wearing a hijab or headscarf
the u.s. embassy in abu dhabi said it was working with all the appropriate authorities to seek further information about the killing of a u.s. citizen
we offer our condolences to those affected by this terrible tragedy a spokesman said in a statement
the safety and welfare of u.s. citizens abroad is one of the department of state's highest priorities
we stand ready to provide all possible consular assistance
the attack happened at the boutik mall on reem island a newly developed area of abu dhabi where many western expatriates live
the embassy had issued a statement back in october warning u.s. citizens of an anonymous internet post that encouraged attacks against teachers at american and other international schools
the embassy was unaware of any specific credible threat at that time but called on citizens to be vigilant about their personal security
cctv footage released by police shows the suspect fully covered walking calmly in through the parking lot entrance speaking to security guards picking up a paper and disappearing around the corner out of sight
it then shows the suspect running to the elevator followed by others and getting into the elevator before another clip shows the person leaving the mall through the same parking lot doors
violent crime in the uae is rare and eyewitnesses have expressed shock at the incident
the abu dhabi police will spare no effort in order to unveil this heinous crime and bring the culprit to justice said borshid

syrian president bashar al assad told a french magazine that there haven't been any tangible signs that u.s. led airstrikes in his country have weakened isis despite assertions wednesday by america's top diplomat that significant progress has been made in derailing the islamist extremist group
in an interview with paris match a portion of which was published online wednesday al assad said his government has noticed no change in isis since the air campaign began more than two months ago
it isn't true that the strikes are helpful the syrian president said
they would of course have helped had they been serious and efficient
after first striking isis targets in iraq the u.s. led coalition went after the group inside syria in september
these efforts haven't been coordinated with al assad's government which u.s. and other western leaders have said they want replaced even going as far in some cases as supporting and working with moderate opposition forces fighting to unseat him
yet al assad said in his paris match interview which took place on november twenty eight in damascus and will be published in full thursday that the u.s. led military campaign has limited use because you can't end terrorism with aerial strikes
troops on the ground that know the land and can react are essential
whether or not the strikes have hurt isis there's been little indication that they or anything else has gotten syria closer to an end to a civil war that erupted after mostly peaceful protests in daraa province in march two thousand and eleven
u.s. secretary of state john kerry however offered a very different view of the anti isis fight wednesday
addressing reporters in brussels belgium after a meeting of representatives from the sixty members of the coalition kerry said various efforts from more than one thousand airstrikes to sanctions have significantly hampered isis in the middle east
there was a consensus that the momentum which it had exhibited two months ago has been halted he said
isis has been forced to modify its tactics and some of those modifications are severely hampering their ability to operate in the way that they were
he added that the coalition has taken important steps in defeating on the battlefield restricting its finances enacting laws to restrict the flow of foreign fighters and countering its toxic ideology
the airstrikes are part of that overall strategy and they show no signs of letting up
u.s. central command said that between monday and wednesday of this week there were fourteen coalition airstrikes in syria all of them near kobani the city near the turkish border that in recent weeks has become a key battleground in the ongoing fight in addition to eleven such strikes inside iraq
the united nations has estimated more than one hundred thousand people have died in the syrian civil war
yet the syrian observatory for human rights says the toll is much higher claiming tuesday that it's more than two hundred thousand people among them about sixty three thousand civilians forty five thousand syrian troops and more than fifty thousand rebel fighters
millions more have been displaced inside syria by the violence with the united nations estimating up to one point eight million refugees in neighboring lebanon jordan turkey iraq and egypt
and the situation may only get worse after the u.n.'s world food program earlier this week announced the suspension of food vouchers for syrian refugees because of a lack of funds
asked by paris match if he'd survive this war or if he would have the same fate as once entrenched but later deposed leaders saddam hussein in iraq and moammar gadhafi in libya al assad said the captain doesn't think about death or life he thinks about saving his ship
if he thinks about sinking everyone will die
al assad insisted that his goal has never been to remain president indefinitely adding i am doing my best to save the country
regardless what happens we as syrians will never allow our country to become a toy in western hands he said
it is a fundamental principle for us

who is abu bakr al baghdadi 
who is saja al dulaimi a woman who's been tied to the isis leader 
and what would she be doing in lebanon now purportedly in custody of authorities there 
those are some of the many questions about reports of the arrest of a woman that regional sources describe as al baghdadi's wife al dulaimi but who iraq's interior ministry said wednesday is anything but
what makes the situation even murkier is how little is known about al baghdadi
yes he heads the self declared islamic state leading a group that has used brutal tactics think beheading innocents kidnapping civilians raping women to overtake vast swaths of syria and iraq
yes he fashions himself as a spiritual authority as he spearheads efforts to spread his group's extreme form of sharia law to any territory it touches and to punish nonbelievers along the way
but al baghdadi the man is a mystery
and so is his family his wife or wives included
which brings us back to the woman being held by lebanese authorities
is she not his wife as the iraqi ministry suggests or perhaps an ex wife as american sources in washington say 
or is she a powerful figure heavily involved in isis as a source with knowledge of her arrest told cnn 
and if it's the latter what role did she play in the terrorist group 
and what was she doing in lebanon a country on the fringes of syria's years long civil war 
she's his wife or his ex wife or neither
the reported detention of a wife and child of al baghdadi has made many wonder who exactly the woman is and what she might know about the terrorist group's inner workings
authorities in lebanon where the woman was arrested haven't officially commented on the matter
neither has the cia amid suggestions that western intelligence was involved in her capture
but the iraqi interior ministry citing a source in an intelligence cell under its authority said the woman's identity didn't match up with either of the names it has for al baghdadi's two wives asma fawzi mohammed al dulaimi and israa rajab mahal al qaisi
there is no wife named saja al dulaimi the ministry stated bluntly saying al dulaimi is the sister of a man who is imprisoned in iraq and has been sentenced to death for a series of bombings
it doesn't help that baghdadi's family life is cloaked in mystery
a biography posted on jihadist websites last year gave little away stating simply that he was married
cnn was told that al baghdadi has two wives
the news agency reuters citing tribal sources in iraq said he has three
and isis certainly isn't confirming anything
some of its members took to social media tuesday to deny that any wife of al baghdadi had been arrested
she wielded power but how much 
if the woman is indeed al dulaimi she is very active in the organization a regional source with knowledge of the operation told cnn
she was reported to have previously been held by the syrian regime of president bashar al assad
in march al dulaimi was released from syrian custody as part of a group of one hundred and fifty women who were freed in return for a group of syrian nuns an intelligence source told cnn
but her apparent attempt to cross into lebanon with a child at a time when authorities there are tightening security around the border raises questions about the state of her relationship with al baghdadi
is he estranged from them 
has he fallen out with them 
were they escaping from him 
asked sajjan m. gohel the international security director at the asia pacific foundation
uncertainty also remains about how much influence al dulaimi would have had within isis which is known for its oppressive treatment of women
analysts say women who join isis may find their role limited to that of housewife for jihadi men
but in february isis formed al khansaa a female battalion with about sixty members whose job is to inspect women who pass through checkpoints and to enforce the organization's strict morality code for women
she could reveal vital intelligence or hardly anything
the arrest of al dulaimi if it was her was a coordinated operation involving intelligence agencies from iraq syria and lebanon an intelligence source familiar with the arrest told cnn
the source said the iraqis had help from the u.s. intelligence community an account corroborated by a second source in the region with knowledge of the operation
but in washington the cia had no comment on the matter
rep. adam schiff a california democrat expressed confidence that the united states would be able to gain some intelligence from al dulaimi
we may get insights into al baghdadi's movement who he surrounds himself with whether he was injured and the degree of his injuries he said referring to recent reports that al baghdadi was hurt in airstrikes
not everyone was convinced she would provide a treasure trove of insight into isis though
expressing skepticism a former senior u.s. military official told the new york times that in the iraq war the americans captured a wife of abu musab al zarqawi the leader or al qaeda in iraq isis forerunner
we got little out of her and when we sent her back zarqawi killed her the unidentified official told the newspaper
and since al dulaimi was reportedly seized more than a week ago what intelligence she carried may already have passed its sell by date
in military conflicts information flows are very immediate and they become yesterday's news very quickly said michael stephens a middle east research fellow at the royal united services institute in london
she was with a son or a daughter
the identity of the child with al dulaimi is still the subject of conflicting reports
an intelligence source told cnn that the child was al dulaimi's four year old son
other news organizations including agence france presse and the associated press also reported that it was a young boy
but reuters which originally reported the same thing later revised its reporting to say that she was with a daughter
the new york times also said it was a daughter rather than a son
deepening the intrigue one regional source even told cnn that al baghdadi himself has been calling up asking for his son to be released
the full picture of who exactly lebanese authorities have in their custody is still to be revealed

its streets have been so ground down to the bone that the prize so small but so intensely fought over is now unrecognizable
every time you open your eyes in kobani you see the damage
interactive
explore the devastation of this syrian city
there are people still there but it is hard to gauge how many
food is scarce as is fuel for heat
and day and night indiscriminate homemade mortars rain down on kurdish homes isis borrowing a technique it seems from the syrian regime and using domestic gas canisters and junk metal to kill or maim civilians
you can hear the clank of these metal shards bouncing on the street outside as you try to sleep
airstrikes by the u.s. led coalition against isis often three thuds in rapid succession shake the very ground you are lying on
they have held isis back but not enough for the kurds
from what we saw the front lines appear much more toward the city's center than some kurdish advocates would suggest
to the city's west too isis fighters are nearer than sometimes advertised
this is a fight that is still in the balance
to the city's east is the most hotly contested front line
we are led there by meedya raqqa the pseudonym of a twenty two year old kurdish female fighter
in a testament to the egalitarian way the kurds live she is this unit's commander
she has been fighting isis for two years almost since the sunni extremist group's beginning
isis fighters have been as close as five yards away from her
she has lost friends here but also made them
read
at least forty fighters killed in syrian city of kobani
i lost a lot of friends in this war and i resist to avenge their death she tells me
no matter the destruction in kobani it can be built again the important thing is to destroy this strange enemy that entered our land
the hardest loss to bear is that of her closest friend reeban early this year
the kurds have been fighting a lot longer than coalition airstrikes have been falling
i lost my best friend eight months ago
she killed herself to save her friends and the injured around her raqqa said
these are the difficult moments that we live but i told you we gain strength from these martyrs
they are difficult moments that make you do more to avenge their death to make her dreams come true
the road she began you finish
the death itself was heroic and chilling
reeban was surrounded but also injured
her fellow fighters were too
they had used all their ammunition
reeban pulled back the injured
she advanced while injured and then isis surrounded her
girls are very prized by isis
she blew herself up
she killed a lot of them with her
her last words to me were
we will liberate our land with the last drop of blood in my body 
read
report
children say isis captured beat them on way home from exams
amid all the machismo war usually generates it is jarring to see the defense of this city performed by women in their early twenty s. they are very emotionally in touch with each other often hugging the polar opposite of isis worldview
kurdish women's resistance will show the world a new history of women in which can break all the rules that have no real basis in customs or traditions said raqqa
but first the fight for kobani
she leads us through a series of holes made in the walls of buildings rendered skeletal by the fighting in the east
one official called the city kobanigrad after the city whose people and essence the soviet union's joseph stalin sacrificed to make a point
it is hard to know what will be left to celebrate once the fighting ends but up on the gun position she takes us to the intensity of the battle remains clear
heavy machine guns try to hit isis in the rubble
isis fighters lie dead in the no man's land between the two front lines distant in their decay from the glorious death of which isis propaganda often talks
one navy machine gun jams repeatedly
this is a war the kurds are still fighting with aging scavenged weapons even though pinpoint munitions fall from coalition jets onto their common enemy
their fighters repeated plea is for better weaponry
across no man's land you can hear isis call out alla u akhbar god is the greatest the group's common rallying cry
the kurds also muslims mock it gently
their two views of civilization are almost millennia apart but now separated by a stretch of icy mud increasingly smaller than they would like

finding the most famous chimpanzees in the world is a task that would test the most intrepid of explorers
reaching the picturesque hinterland of gombe stream national park in tanzania is just the start
a two hour boat ride across the vast waters of lake tanganyika follows
finally we disembark and begin to trek through the dense forests of gombe for a further hour before the chimps in question are finally glimpsed
peering through branches towards the canopies we spy a mother and her two young boys feasting on palm nuts
it was close to this spot in one thousand nine hundred and sixty that the jane goodall the british primatologist widely regarded as the world's foremost expert on chimpanzees began her near fifty five year study of one specially selected chimp family
goodall now eighty years old would sit for hours and observe the complex social structures and interactions of her subjects
the research of that one family and the subsequent generations it has spawned continues to this day providing ever more fascinating insights into the behavior of the closest living relatives of human beings
the magic of gombe is two factors said emily boehm a phd candidate at the jane goodall institute research center here to study the chimps
it's the opportunity to be here with a well habituated group of chimpanzees to come into the forest every day with knowledgeable field assistants
it's the long term data because jane goodall started this study in the early sixty s
we have this incredible opportunity to know the chimps here now and also their mothers and fathers and their grandmothers and all this incredible information that we have on them
researchers like emily come from all over the world to study the chimps at gombe
there are an estimated one hundred chimpanzees there today broken up into three different communities
the group goodall studied has the most with around sixty members
even after fifty plus years researchers are still surprised by what they learn
before the program began chimpanzees were thought to be herbivores but goodall saw them hunting monkeys and eating meat
this is a trait we observe as we watch a group of chimps track colobus monkeys swinging in the trees above them
we also see another industrious bunch fashion tools to try dislodge termites from beneath a mound
according to senior researcher at the jane goodall foundation dr anthony collins activities like these display a high level of intelligence
they're so much like humans
there are so many similarities in what they do the relationships they have to each other just all kinds of ways there are subtle communications between them collins said
he points to the example of how chimps will look to reconcile and embrace one another after a fight or confrontation
they have reassurance and forgiveness of things which go wrong he said
despite the behavioral and genetic similarities however the chimps proximity to rural human settlements can often be problematic and detrimental to their own well being
in some places that they live there are lions leopards pythons
but on the whole probably their main enemy is something like me humans collins continued
people hunt chimps for eating some places they get bits of chimps for cures even witchcraft and for a while there was a trade in baby chimps for their medical research and things like circuses and zoos
in the dense forest and woodlands of gombe chimpanzees and other species are protected from the most destructive aspects of human behavior
but that's not always the case in other sectors of the tanzanian bush where large swathes of land have been transformed for agricultural purposes
this has resulted in a huge number of trees being cut down that would otherwise offer shelter for communities of chimpanzees
sadly the best habitats for chimps are often also the best habitat for the likes of nomadic herders
recognizing these problems the jane goodall institute is working to teach the local population about sustainable farming so the forest is preserved
through the gombe masito program they aim to show villagers that sustainable agricultural techniques can bring both more income and a more vibrant habitat for all species
preventing deforestation also has the knock on effect of ensuring sediments from the forest continue to run into lake tanganyika maintaining the finely balanced ecosystem beneath the water and the trade of the fisherman in lakeside communities as a result
these deep environmental connections are enough to convince some that chimpanzees are key to the future of rural tanzania
in my opinion chimps are important for the country's economic growth said aristides aloice kashula a gombe masito program forest officer
they can be used as a national symbol for tourist attraction into this area of tanzania generating income which should later be used for sustainable development of the communities
they are also important in that their habitat if well conserved can act as good vegetation covering for the forest
but also again chimps are a global species so they have to be kept for generations and generation to come
that's a sentiment that jane goodall herself would be sure to endorse

one day after executing dozens of non muslims at a quarry in kenya the islamist militant group al shabaab waged an attack in its home base of somalia killing at least four people according to police in an attack on a united nations convoy
three of those killed in wednesday morning's attack near mogadishu's airport were civilians and another was a security force member police col. mohamed hassan said
i saw at least two dead bodies lying in a pool of blood on the ground and police arrived soon at the area and began shooting in the air to disperse the crowds a witness named sharma'arke said by phone from the scene
a plume of black smoke could be seen rising from the airport which also acts as a staging ground for united nations operations and for the african union troops on a peacekeeping mission in somalia
two united nations vehicles were damaged a u.n. official said but no u.n. staff members were killed or injured
al shabaab claimed responsibility for what spokesman sheikh abdiaziz abu musab called a sacred bomb attack targeting foreign mercenaries and u.n. staff
abu musab said this action had claimed the lives of several somali soldiers and foreigners working with u.n. but he did not specify a number of dead or their nationalities
such violence in somalia and carried out by al shabaab is hardly unprecedented
the group has been active in east africa for years waging an armed campaign that initially aimed to turn somalia into a fundamentalist islamic state according to the council on foreign relations
yet al shabaab which the united states designated as a foreign terrorist organization in march two thousand and eight hasn't confined its targets to somali authorities
its militants have also killed international aid workers journalists civilian leaders and african union peacekeepers
somali and allied au forces have pushed back even forcing al shabaab from its last major stronghold in barawe in early october according to residents and military commanders
yet they haven't stopped the group entirely as evidenced by a deadly car bombing outside a popular mogadishu restaurant one week after that milestone
and it's not as though al shabaab is confining itself to somalia
the terrorist group whose then leader ahmed godane pledged allegiance to al qaeda in two thousand and twelve has been active elsewhere in africa as well
its bombers attacked bars and restaurants in the ugandan capital of kampala on the night of the two thousand and ten world cup final killing more than sixty people
and last fall al shabaab militants casually walked into the upscale westgate mall in nairobi kenya and began gunning down shoppers allegedly torturing some hostages before killing them
the four day long siege ended with as many as sixty seven dead and parts of the mall destroyed
last month authorities said at least twenty eight died after al shabaab ambushed a bus in kenya and sprayed bullets on those who failed to recite quran verses
and on tuesday the group's militants raided a quarry in the kenyan village of kormey near the somali border separating non muslim workers from their muslim counterparts and executing them group spokesman sheikh ali dheere said in a statement read on a pro al shabaab radio station in somalia
at least thirty six bodies were found dumped in the quarry according to the kenyan red cross

three co founders of a pro democracy organization that's been demonstrating for weeks in hong kong reported to police wednesday though other groups hunger strikers among them remain out in force demanding sweeping reforms on the island
the three leaders of occupy central with love and peace all middle aged men announced their intention to surrender to police a day earlier and encouraged student protesters to stand down too
but their younger counterparts aren't budging for the time being despite the recent loss of one key protest site and clashes with police at the demonstrators main encampment earlier this week
for the sake of the occupiers safety for the sake of our original intention of love and peace as we prepare to surrender we three urge the students to retreat benny tai one of the three occupy co founders said at a news conference tuesday
tai a law professor first came up with the idea to occupy downtown hong kong to call for universal suffrage but he has not always been on the same page as student leaders who launched the current protests two months ago
those other groups scholarism and the hong kong federation of students haven't given any indication they will budge in their demands chief among them that citizens be allowed to elect their next leader from an open field of candidates rather than those preselected by a committee loyal to the chinese government
earlier this fall the two groups even penned an open letter urging chinese president xi jinping to closely consider their cause
there will only be more citizens disillusioned with our corrupted institutions marching and protesting as long as no genuine democracy is practiced in this place they wrote
some scholarism members are waging a hunger strike in an effort to secure talks with the hong kong government to demand democracy
yet in a statement wednesday chief executive c.y
leung's office urged them to take good care of their health and said that expressing views on constitutional reform through illegal and confrontational means is bound to be futile
the request by some scholarism members to conduct dialogue with the government on relaunching constitutional reform will not and could not be by the government it is impractical and has contravened the legal procedures leung's office said
tai and the other two co founders chan kin man and chu yiu ming left the police station in central hong kong after about an hour wednesday
tai told reporters outside that they were asked to record their particular offenses committed during the protest movement and then told they were free to go
he said they were not given a date of when they need to return to the police station
police said twenty four people ages thirty three to eighty two surrendered at the police station wednesday for the offense of taking part in an unauthorized assembly 
many of the people taking part in the decentralized protest movement do not consider the occupy founders to be their leaders and they are unlikely to be influenced by tai's call for retreat
who's who in the hong kong protests 

the united states and iran may be bombing a common enemy in iraq one whom they both despise isis
recent media reports from the region claim iran's military conducted air raids in eastern iraq and on tuesday a spokesman for the pentagon said the reports might be true
we have indications that they have flown these missions in recent days these airstrikes in eastern iraq rear admiral john kirby told cnn's wolf blitzer
no coordination u.s. says
is iran coordinating with the u.s. led coalition fighting the sunni islamist extremists 
adamantly no came the answer from both sides
the u.s. is not working with iran's military and it is not even directly communicating with it over operations in the country kirby said
we are not coordinating with nor are we deconflicting with iranian military he said
both sides are leaving it to iraq to manage their movements in iraqi airspace and keep them both out of each other's hair
speaking from brussels belgium u.s. secretary of state john kerry didn't confirm or deny iran's military action saying that's up to the iraqi or iranian government
but he did say that while the united states is coordinating its military action with iraqi authorities nothing has changed as far as its lack of coordination with iran
i think it's self evident that if iran is taking in some particular place and it's confined to taking on and it has an impact it's going to be a net effect that is positive kerry said
but it's not something we're coordinating
a high ranking iranian military official also vehemently rejected the notion that there may have been any coordinated bombing and he attacked the united states in his comments
the islamic republic of iran blames the united states as the root cause of unrests and problems as well as the terrorist actions of isil in iraq gen. massoud jazayeri told the government approved fars news agency adding that iran wants u.s. influence to completely evaporate
in another fars report the head of iran's revolutionary guard characterized the united states as an enemy not an ally
today the americans are in a strategic dead end and have experienced all possible options and strategies against the islamic revolution but couldn't attain their desired goals maj. gen. mohammad ali jafari said
the u.s. capabilities can no more be expanded and their capacities for initiating a change have reached the level of saturation meaning that the u.s. is left with no more option but admitting the islamic republic of iran's real power
yet isis is one of few issues that iran and the united states agree on
both countries want to quash the terror group that has been taking over large swaths of iraq and syria
but with no diplomatic relations with iran and lingering concerns about its nuclear program the united states has had to walk a tightrope over iran's involvement
this was reflected in comments that u.s. president barack obama made to cbs face the nation
there is some deconflicting in the sense that since they have some troops or militias they control in and around baghdad
we let them know don't mess with us
we're not here to mess with you 
we're focused on our common enemy obama said
word of iranian participation in the fight against isis is nothing new
a military official in iran has said the world can thank his country that isis has not been able to assault baghdad
the terrorists sought to surround baghdad but they failed in reaching their ominous goals thanks to iran's supports brig
gen. esmayeel qa'ani told fars
qa'ani is lieutenant commander of the quds force an elite unit of iran's revolutionary guard corps
according to fars senior military officials in baghdad said the quds force helped free the iraqi town of jurf al sakher from isis control
but the common interest is complicated by diverging interests
the united states wants to put an end to all islamist extremism and in the past it has accused tehran of sponsoring terrorism
iran itself is an islamic republic governed by stringent islamic law
but the state religion is shia islam which sunni muslim extremists such as isis consider heresy
in neighboring iraq there is a tense and at times violent schism between shia and sunni factions with the former dominating in government
iran has close ties to the shia faction
that has stirred fears in washington that iran's involvement could not only weaken isis but could also drive the wedge between iraqis deeper
we want nothing to be done that further inflames sectarian tensions in the country kirby said of iranian military actions
iran is also a close ally of syrian dictator bashar al assad who is battling isis as well
beating back isis would take some pressure off of his troops
the united states is calling for al assad's removal



a short circuit has impaired part of a nuclear power plant in southeastern ukraine causing power shortages in parts of the country but putting no one in danger of radiation the country's newly appointed energy minister said wednesday
the incident at the plant in zaporizhya happened last week and emergency repairs should be finished by friday the energy ministry said
there is no threat to the reactor energy minister volodymyr demchyshyn said
this is a technical problem that is currently being solved
the short circuit happened in a power output system he said
information on what caused the problem in the plant's third block wasn't immediately available
low temperatures had recently caused an increase in demand for power the ministry said in a written statement earlier this week
the imbalance of the power supply is due to the emergency repair of the energy unit three in zaporizhya nuclear power plant as well as inadequate supplies of coal in the power plants warehouses the energy ministry said in a statement tuesday
the situation is under control and the unit will be under repair until december five th
a ministry spokeswoman told cnn that the incident happened friday but was announced only on tuesday because people started asking about the power shortages
the media office of energoatom the state nuclear power plant operator said the internal generator safety system cut off the transformer for the plant's third unit
zaporizhya is europe's largest nuclear power plant according to energoatom
it has been operating since one thousand nine hundred and eighty four with the third unit brought online in one thousand nine hundred and eighty six
it has six power units altogether with a total capacity of six thousand megawatts
zaporizhya is in territory controlled by the ukrainian government in kiev
it is about two hundred kilometers west of the city of donetsk which is a stronghold of pro russian rebels that have been battling ukrainian forces for months in southeastern ukraine
the plant is about five hundred and twenty kilometers southeast of chernobyl the ukrainian community where a nuclear power plant reactor exploded when ukraine was part of the soviet union in one thousand nine hundred and eighty six
it is estimated that more than four thousand cleanup workers died and close to seventy thousand were disabled from radiation related causes
according to the united nations the explosion and fire that occurred at chernobyl affected directly or indirectly nine million people because of radioactive materials released into the atmosphere

these are just some of the objects confiscated by polish customs officers and documented by adam lach a photographer and filmmaker at napo images
for lach the illegal wildlife trade symbolizes the devastation that can result from human thoughtlessness which like locusts can destroy all we have around us
lach first learned about the illicit trade when he was a teenager in the one thousand nine hundred and ninety s. he was shocked by the stories he heard
but it was seeing an exhibit of trafficked animal goods items seized by customs officials at an airport in warsaw poland that prompted him to embark on his photographic project human tsunami
i am not an idealist but in our world we have the belief that we are the only valuable existence on planet earth and this is not acceptable lach said
the relation of men towards animals and nature is a reflection of the characteristics of the whole human population as we still allow crimes against animals and nature
we do not understand that respecting the planet translates into respect of the people for themselves
let us keep balance and let us use only what we need to live by
cutting off the leg of an elephant and using it as a trash can is a testament to our hypocrisy
lach's pictures were mostly taken over a two week period although he anticipates taking more in the future
some of the specimens shown were confiscated years ago at the warsaw airport which placed its exhibit in the middle of the departures terminal to raise awareness of the problem
lach's images are not a story about a particular airport he said but they reflect a wider issue
through these photographs i will try to sensitize people and make them aware that they are often part of the problem he said
this project aims to show human arrogance and folly and to build in us humility
in my work i often use the sense of peace and tranquility in the photographs
i avoid screaming images
hence the idea of a black background i wanted to isolate these exhibits to give them the rank of authenticity and pain
i wanted to pass on as well how uncomfortable i felt when i had to touch and set up these exhibits to be photographed or listen to horror stories of the customs officers
one story that stood out in particular for lach was that of a rapid decline in a seahorse species surrounding indonesia
this decline came suddenly out of nowhere he recounted
a short time afterwards the polish customs officers intercepted a cargo of dried seahorses
it turned out that some indonesian company exported them to poland as dietary supplements a total of twenty seven tons of seahorses
how many seahorses had to die to produce twenty seven tons of powder 
millions
that almost threatened the extinction of the entire population perhaps even more than one species
it shows how easy it is to cause irreparable damage to nature and how stupid we are
polish customs officers have done well in combating the trade lach said
they no longer find cardboard boxes filled with hundreds of turtles or parrot cages containing tied up birds or containers of snakes and lizards that are stuffed so full that only half survived the trip he said
now smuggling efforts are more likely to involve someone trying to transport a baby monkey or pass off a serval an african wild cat as a domestic cat he said
at first glance it seems therefore that it is better
but it is not lach said
this illegal trade is running as before even faster only ever more discreetly
before this trade flourished in markets and pet stores while today traders often use the internet
it is not only convenient but also safer
the merchant offers for sale one or two pieces sends them by courier and if there is a setback the loss is small
the criminal responsibility is smaller too because it deals with smuggling a single specimen
illegal transactions favor the internet
a global network does not recognize borders
today lach said anyone with an internet connection can visit the traffickers websites
the only limitation is language he said
one who knows languages can buy everything

judy gross says she doesn't know how much longer her husband can make it
but she's scared it won't be long
alan is resolved that he will not endure another year imprisoned in cuba and i am afraid that we are at the end she said in a statement released wednesday
her comments come on the five year anniversary of the day when cuban authorities arrested her husband alan gross who'd been working as a subcontractor the u.s. agency for international development
alan gross sixty five is serving a fifteen year sentence for bringing satellite communications equipment to cuba as part of his work as a state department subcontractor
he was convicted in march two thousand and eleven
after five years of literally wasting away alan is done judy gross said
it is time for president obama to bring alan back to the united states now
otherwise it will be too late
the cuban government has called for a prisoner swap
gross for three imprisoned cuban intelligence agents serving lengthy federal prison sentences in the united states
but the u.s. state department has nixed that idea saying gross was an aid worker merely trying to help cuba's small jewish community get online despite cuban government restrictions on internet access
frustrated by the diplomatic impasse gross has threatened to kill himself if he isn't freed soon
in july he said goodbye to his wife and daughter and has refused to see them again while he's imprisoned
he's also refused to meet with u.s. diplomats in havana in protest over the slow progress to free him
on wednesday his family warned that his health is deteriorating
he's lost more than one hundred pounds he can barely walk because of chronic pain and he has lost five teeth and much of the sight in his right eye the family's statement said
the state department renewed calls for his release on tuesday decrying his unjustified imprisonment in difficult conditions in cuba
it is gravely disappointing especially in light of its professed goal of providing cubans with internet access that the cuban government has not allowed mr
gross to return to his family where he belongs the state department said
we reiterate our call on the cuban government echoing foreign leaders and even cuba's allies to release alan gross immediately
last month u.s. sens
jeff flake and tom udall traveled to cuba to push for the former state department contractor's release calling his imprisonment an impediment to improving u.s. relations with the island nation
gross was arrested in two thousand and nine accused of smuggling in the banned communications equipment
u.s. officials said gross was merely trying to help cubans bypass the island's stringent restrictions on internet access
but cuban authorities say gross was part of a plot to create a cuban spring and destabilize the island's single party communist government

despite a highly publicized anti corruption drive spearheaded by president xi jinping china's position on an international corruption perceptions index has deteriorated in the past twelve months
transparency international's corruption perceptions index two thousand and fourteen ranks countries based on a one hundred point corruption perception scale where zero equals a highly corrupt perception and one hundred means the country is perceived to be very clean
in the report released wednesday china scored thirty six falling to one hundred th place from eighty th last year putting it on a par with algeria and suriname
north korea and somalia rank equal worst of one hundred and seventy four countries with a score of just eight
denmark and new zealand ranked least corrupt with scores of ninety two and ninety one respectively
the corruption perceptions index highlights the problems that emerging economies have with public sector corruption misappropriation of funds and bribery said jose ugaz the chair of transparency international in a press release
it's based on perceptions of public sector corruption from the perspective of business people and country experts
the transparency international report is inconsistent with china's well known achievements in the anticorruption campaign chinese ministry of foreign affairs spokesperson hua chunying told cnn
the public will judge the achievement that the government has obtained and it will not be affected by the index
corruption is the disease of human society which harms the justice and development of the entire society
it has to be eliminated
xi's much vaunted drive against the tigers high ranking public officials and flies lowly apparatchiks has been touted as a life or death priority for the leader who announced the initiative shortly after taking office in two thousand and twelve
since then chinese state media says seventy five thousand cadres have been found in breach of austerity measures as of the end of august
recently the anti corruption drive was extended to china's military with particular emphasis on projects and medical and weapons procurement china daily reported
in the past xi has said that corruption could lead to the collapse of the party and the downfall of the state
despite his warnings and attempts to address the issue the report finds that perceptions of public sector corruption in china are worsening
rukshana nanayakkara regional outreach manager for the asia pacific region transparency international says that beijing's approach is misguided
china's fight against corruption focuses on prosecution a very top down way of fighting corruption he told cnn
the whole campaign of catching tigers and flies and from this summer the foxhunt they all talk about prosecution punishing people
in many other parts of the world it is a more holistic approach you need to talk about prevention as well
so irrespective of the fact that china is trying to punish corrupt officials it is still thrives
so this is a very strong message to china
china's drop from forty points to thirty six from in the index was one of the biggest falls of two thousand and fourteen transparency said
other countries whose rankings dropped were turkey which dropped five points and angola malawi and rwanda which all dropped four
transparency international says the extent of corruption within countries has an impact on their own economic growth and there's a risk of problems being exported with trade and investment
the two thousand and fourteen corruption perceptions index shows that economic growth is undermined and efforts to stop corruption fade when leaders and high level officials abuse power to appropriate public funds for personal gain ugaz said in a statement
corrupt officials smuggle ill gotten assets into safe havens through offshore companies with absolute impunity
countries at the bottom need to adopt radical anti corruption measures in favor of their people
countries at the top of the index should make sure they don't export corrupt practices to underdeveloped countries ugaz added
top countries and mark out of one hundred
bottom countries and mark out of one hundred



there are sixteen thousand nine hundred and eleven cases of ebola worldwide and despite missing its own target on burials the world health organization is confident it can still catch up with the virus even on such a large scale
only liberia and guinea met a who target set for december one to safely bury seventy percents of the people who die from ebola
in sierra leone that target was not met because the western part of the country is currently dealing with real escalation said bruce aylward who is in charge of the who's ebola response
the good news for the who is that the gap between the number of ebola cases and the response capacity is closing and more people are being isolated and are getting treatment he said
the international national and community willingness is there and the investments are there aylward said
in order to stop ebola we have got to get to one hundred percents safe burials one hundred percents isolation and then one hundred percents of cases being found contacts being traced in order to stop the outbreak he said
since the outbreak began in march five thousand nine hundred and ninety four people have died from the disease according to the who

a film that features a dance routine inspired by karl marx and examines african art has won britain's most prestigious and controversial art prize
the turner prize which is worth twenty five thousand was awarded to the irish film artist duncan campbell in a glittering ceremony last night
his film it for others which was described by the panel as an ambitious and complex film which rewards repeated viewing is a response to a film essay from one thousand nine hundred and fifty three about african art and colonialism
this archive footage is interspersed with new material including a dance routine based on the equations in karl marx's seminal work das kapital created by the choreographer michael clark
all of this is overlaid with a voiceover that imitates the style of a lecture
the critical response has been largely hostile with commentators describing campbell's video as overlong baffling and hectoring
the judging panel however admired the artist's exceptional dedication to making a work which speaks about the construction of value and meaning in ways that are topical and compelling
campbell was the bookmaker's favorite
he topped a four person shortlist that included james richards ciara phillips and tris vonna michell to win the coveted prize
the artist described winning the award as surreal but acknowledged that this money will make a huge difference
even being nominated for the prize has given me great heart he said
some critics have however been vocal in their condemnation of campbell's winning video
digby warde aldam the art critic for the uk's spectator magazine said
surely no arbiter in their right mind could have let such hectoring cultural studies sanctioned guff slip through the net 
if you're serious about the rubbish on show this year you are insulting every artist working in britain today he said
the guardian newspaper based in london acknowledged that campbell has produced the most consistently interesting body of work of all four shortlisted artists but described his winning fifty four minute video as overlong over complicated and more like a lecture than an artwork
and the telegraph newspaper quoted the director of the tate britain penelope curtis as saying that the video was a bit baffling and quite odd
campbell who lives in scotland is a graduate of the glasgow school of art
he is the fourth alumni of the school to have won the prize in the last ten years
the school's director professor tom inns described campbell's success as a great accolade both for duncan and for the glasgow school of art

qatar has lifted a travel ban against a u.s. couple who were cleared in that mideast nation in the death of their adopted daughter meaning they are free to return home the u.s. ambassador to qatar said tuesday
an appeals judge in qatar on sunday cleared matthew and grace huang of starving their adopted daughter to death in two thousand and thirteen in a case that drew global attention to that country's justice system
the huangs were blocked from leaving qatar on sunday at hamad international airport by immigration officials who confiscated their passports according to the doha news agency citing family spokesman eric volz
diplomatic sources said monday the departure was delayed due only to legal procedures that take place once people have been cleared of a crime
on tuesday u.s
ambassador to qatar dana smith said a travel ban against the couple was lifted following a motion that was filed monday and after talks between smith and top qatari officials
the huangs who were living in qatar while matthew huang worked for an international company that was constructing sites for the two thousand and twenty two world cup were arrested in january two thousand and thirteen when their eight year old daughter gloria died
they were charged with starving her to death convicted in march and sentenced to three years in prison
the qatari prosecutor sought to paint grace and matthew huang as inhumane alleging they bought their adopted daughter cheaply from her poverty stricken parents in africa and had threatened to seek human trafficking charges
the couple spent nearly a year in prison before being freed in november two thousand and thirteen to await proceedings surrounding an appeal that they filed
appellate judge abdulrahman al sharafi overturned the conviction on sunday citing weaknesses in forensic reports and saying the trial judge failed to properly consider testimony from witnesses who said gloria wasn't deprived
a report by pathologists hired by the defense obtained by cnn stated they found no evidence that tissue samples were taken from gloria's body after her death despite the fact qatari investigators submitted an autopsy report
advocates for the huangs suggested the lab report was fabricated and said their request with the qatari judiciary for a formal investigation went unanswered
after the couple's arrest their two sons also adopted from africa were temporarily placed in a qatari orphanage
they have since been sent back to the united states to live with grace huang's mother

israel will soon have new elections after its prime minister called for the dismissal of two critical members of his coalition cabinet and announced he'd call for the dissolution of the nation's legislature his office announced tuesday
prime minister benjamin netanyahu ordered letters of dismissal for finance minister yair lapid and justice minister tzipi livni two members of his cabinet from rival parties according to a statement from his office
during the last few weeks and in particular the last few days the ministers have intensely attacked the government that i am leading netanyahu said

i will not tolerate ministers attacking the government's policy and its head from inside the government
the moves come at a tenuous time in israel which has been beset by a number of recent terrorist attacks against citizens in jerusalem
the head of the right wing likud party netanyahu has been israel's prime minister since two thousand and nine
but he's had to rely on members of other parties many of them to the left of likud on the political spectrum to govern
his likud party for instance won more seats than any other party in the january two thousand and thirteen election but still fell well short of the sixty needed to have a majority in the knesset
he ended up bringing on other parties into his government
the first to join was the movement a centrist party led by livni a former opposition leader and foreign minister
yapid a charismatic journalist turned politician became another key player after his centrist yesh atid party finished a surprising second in that national election
netanyahu told reporters tuesday a divided government was one of israel's problems saying there was a lot of debate contradictions and ultimatums
he called out livni for meeting with palestinian authority president mahmoud abbas against his recommendation and for criticizing building in jerusalem which some say has exacerbated tensions with arabs there
and netanyahu lambasted lapid for calling israel's boycott of iranian president hassan rouhani's u.n. speech a mistake and challenging his push to label israel a jewish state which some fear will alienate the country's significant arab population
he also accused the ministers of being behind talks to kick out the prime minister
in one word they call this a putsch netanyahu said
you can not have a government like this
it's impossible to govern like this
in a facebook post tuesday livni said the question in the election will not be who was the first to identify the threats and use them for political means but who will deal with the threats in a responsible level headed manner for the good of the country
yesh atid also fired back in a statement in which it said lapid told netanyahu by phone that he expected the prime minister to act responsibly and to stop dragging the and our soldiers into an election for your political needs
yesh atid claimed that unnecessary elections
will harm the economy and israeli society all for narrow political interests and a surrender to the ultra orthodox parties the powerful central committee of the likud and outside lobby groups
prime minister netanyahu has failed in his management of the country and in dealing with the needs of the israeli public the yesh atid party said
the firing of ministers is an act of cowardice and loss of control

pope francis said on tuesday that modern slavery is a crime against humanity and is unfortunately becoming worse and worse every day
this takes place in hiding behind closed doors in private homes in the streets in the cars in factories in the fields in fishing boats and in so many other places the pope said through an interpreter during a panel discussion tuesday led by cnn's christiane amanpour
this takes place both in cities and in villages in villages of the richest and the poorest nations on earth
a diverse group of faith leaders gathered at the vatican on tuesday to sign a declaration pledging to inspire spiritual and practical action by all global faiths and people of good will everywhere to eradicate slavery by the year two thousand and twenty
leaders and representatives of catholic anglican and orthodox christianity judaism shiite and sunni islam buddhism and hinduism all were present and signed the initiative
cnn has championed the cause of eradicating slavery having launched its freedom project in march two thousand and eleven
an estimated thirty five point eight million people are enslaved according to the global slavery index
as the pope pointed out the problem is far from limited to developing countries
more than sixty thousand people are estimated to be enslaved in the united states more than ten thousand in germany and more than one thousand in sweden
most victims in europe and central asia are forced into sexual exploitation the united nations says
in east asia and the pacific region most are used for forced labor
the victims come from all walks of life but most times they are the poorest and the most vulnerable of our brothers and sisters francis said
the joint declaration calls modern slavery a crime against humanity and says that eradication in less than a decade is achievable
today we have the opportunity awareness wisdom innovation and technology to achieve this human and moral imperative it states

new dna tests reveal britain's long lost king richard iii was blue eyed and likely blond haired but they also raise intriguing questions over whether he and other monarchs before and since should have been on the throne at all
experts researching the case of the king in the car park a set of remains dug up from beneath a parking lot in the central english city of leicester in two thousand and twelve now say they are ninety nine point nine nine nine percents positive that the bones are those of richard iii who died at the battle of bosworth in one thousand four hundred and eighty five
genetic specialist turi king from the university of leicester said analysis of various genetic markers offered tantalizing clues to richard iii's appearance suggesting that he was not the dark haired steely eyed monarch portrayed in well known historical images
there are genes that we know are involved in coding for hair and eye color
the genetic evidence shows he had a ninety six percents probability of having blue eyes and a seventy seven percents probability of having blond hair though this can darken with age
while there are no contemporary portraits of richard all known works post date his death by at least twenty five to thirty years leaving the artists who painted them open to charges that they were influenced by propaganda the dna findings suggest the arch framed portrait of richard owned by the society of antiquaries of london is the closest to his real appearance
king said the latest scientific evidence combined with statistical analysis published in nature communications and funded by the wellcome trust and leverhulme trust provided overwhelming proof of the skeleton's identity
at its most conservative it's ninety nine point nine nine nine percents certain she explained
the likelihood ratio is six point seven million to one that these are richard's remains
but while detailed genetic testing and painstaking genealogical research helped confirm that one living relative on richard's female line michael ibsen was an exact match to his mitochondrial dna and found a second previously unknown but near perfect mitochondrial match in new zealand born londoner wendy duldig scientists weren't able to trace a living relative on the male line using the y chromosome
and that has raised an intriguing possibility
that neither he nor many other monarchs actually had a cast iron claim to the throne
genealogy expert kevin shrer said it had been relatively straightforward to trace potential living relatives of richard iii along the male line since records of the peerage britain's nobility made it simple to follow such families back century after century
but once five potential living relatives from the male line linking richard iii to his predecessor edward iii and back down the generations via john of gaunt and henry somerset the fifth duke of beaufort had been identified things became more complicated
one of the five was quickly eliminated from the puzzle because his y chromosome dna did not match the other four suggesting a relatively recent false paternity event and when king carried out checks on the y chromosome dna of the remaining four she discovered there was no match there either revealing at least one other case of false paternity in the generations of fathers and sons leading back to edward iii
we can't tell you where that break is because we simply don't know it could be at any one of the nineteen links in the chain between those two individuals shrer said adding that while each link in that chain was equally likely to be the one which was broken if the break occurred in the first few generations around richard iii it could bring various monarchs right to rule into question
there are some well known and important people on that chain he said
you have two monarchs richard and edward iii
if the break occurred on the yorkist line
then that might raise questions about the legitimacy of the yorkists claim to the throne
the lancastrian line comes through john of gaunt's side of the family
so if the break were on that side it raises questions about the legitimacy of the lancastrian monarchs and because there was a tudor link to that line as well also the tudors
but he said the tudors also had another argument for their right to rule since they took the throne by force at the battle of bosworth
and he was quick to point out that whatever the implications of the latest discovery current monarch queen elizabeth ii's position was secure
we're certainly not saying the house of windsor has no legitimate claim to the throne far from it shrer explained
royal succession doesn't work like that
there is no linear succession line between edward iii and elizabeth ii
yes they are related but the whole point of monarchy is that over several centuries it takes various twists and turns
monarchy is about opportunity and chance as much as it is about bloodline

more than one point seven million syrian refugees will face a food shortage due to a funding crisis the united nations world food program said monday
the wfp had to suspend its program providing food vouchers which refugees use in jordan lebanon turkey iraq and egypt the agency said
the program needs sixty four million dollar immediately it said adding that the repercussions of suspending the vouchers will be disastrous

lebanese authorities have arrested a wife of isis leader abu bakr al baghdadi the man spearheading the islamist terror group's sweeping rampage across syria and iraq said a source with knowledge of the arrest
the woman is one of al baghdadi's two wives
her arrest came as part of a planned operation according to the source
the source described her as a powerful figure heavily involved in isis
not much is known about the reported wife including what her involvement is with the terrorist group if any
we will gain some intelligence from her
we may get insights into al baghdadi's movement who he surrounds himself with whether he was injured and the degree of his injuries said rep. adam schiff a california democrat
another intelligence source identified the wife as saja al dulaimi
she was detained with her four year old son more than a week ago when they tried to enter lebanon that source said
the arrest was a coordinated operation involving agencies from iraq syria and lebanon said the intelligence source
the source said the iraqis had help from u.s. intelligence
in washington the cia declined to comment
also in washington several american sources suggested the person arrested was al baghdadi's ex wife not a current one
al baghdadi has been calling for the release of his son the intelligence source said adding that al dulaimi was released from syrian custody in march as part of a group of one hundred and fifty women who were freed in exchange for a group of syrian nuns
the greek orthodox nuns had been kidnapped and held captive by the al qaeda linked al nusra front which al baghdadi had helped establish
lebanese authorities didn't immediately respond to requests for comment from cnn
agence france presse citing unidentified lebanese security officials reported one of al baghdadi's sons was detained
but reuters also citing lebanese officials said that a daughter rather than a son was being held
the two agencies similarly differed on when the two were picked up by lebanese forces
reuters said it happened in recent days
afp reported it was ten days ago
regardless the very idea that a government may be holding close relatives of al baghdadi is significant given his pivotal role in isis meteoric rise the extremist group's widely reviled tactics under his leadership and the breadth of the international coalition aimed at defeating isis
it's certainly a new dynamic because we've never seen anybody connected so close to al baghdadi being detained terrorism expert sajjan m. gohel said
at the same time the reports raise a lot of questions such as what the family members might have been doing in lebanon
is he estranged from them 
has he fallen out with them 
were they escaping from him 
asked gohel who is the international security director at the asia pacific foundation
lebanon is one of several countries heavily affected by syria's yearslong conflict and the flood of refugees trying to escape the violence
lebanese authorities have been cracking down very heavily on the border to prevent members of isis seeping into lebanon gohel said
they don't want the problems spilling over from iraq and syria into their territory
another question raised by the reports is whether the wife is affiliated with isis
if she's simply an ex wife the first thing you got to deal with is she's an innocent person potentially who was married to a bad guy with a child said philip mudd a former cia counterterrorism official
the first hurdle
before we deal with what she knows is how closely was she affiliated and how hard can you press her based on that affiliation
that's an ethical question he said
mystery surrounds arrest of woman who may be isis leader's wife
isis rises after al baghdadi took over
the group that in two thousand and six would become isis began in iraq where it targeted the u.s. led coalition as well as shiite muslims in the country
it suffered heavy losses but ascended over the past few years to take advantage of a void wrought by syria's civil war as well as instability in iraq
not coincidentally this all happened after al baghdadi took over isis in two thousand and ten
before that he'd been at a u.s. prison camp for insurgents at bucca in southern iraq where he was taken after being detained in february two thousand and four amid fighting in the flashpoint city of falluja
media reports have claimed u.s. authorities held al baghdadi for four years
but the pentagon has offered a different time line saying he was at camp bucca until early december two thousand and four when officials there recommended his unconditional release
beyond this little is known about al baghdadi
according to the u.s. government he was born in samarra iraq and is in his early forty s. what motivates him how he was trained and who he's close to including his family largely remains a mystery
he has emerged from the shadows in fits and spurts
after the death of al qaeda leader osama bin laden in two thousand and eleven al baghdadi issued a eulogy in which he threatened violent retribution
there were unconfirmed suggestions last month that al baghdadi had been wounded in airstrikes in northern iraq
but days later an audio recording emerged that purportedly contained a message from al baghdadi saying the u.s. led coalition to destroy isis is terrified weak and powerless
isis itself has never been more powerful having taken over vast swaths of territory in iraq and syria in the past few years
and it has used brutal tactics to do so such as mass kidnappings rapes killings and other abuses against civilians and fighting foes alike actions that a u.n. panel characterized as war crimes and crimes against humanity
al baghdadi who has gone by a variety of aliases during his career in terrorism has been at the center of it
the u.s. state department's reward's for justice program which refers to him as abu du'a offers ten million dollar for information leading to his arrest
when his group rebranded itself as the islamic state in june al baghdadi was tapped as spiritual leader of the new caliphate
he's sought to burnish his theological credentials with a biography posted on jihadist websites last year claiming he had earned a doctorate in islamic studies from a university in baghdad
his knowledge in islamic jurisprudence is somewhat dubious but nevertheless he's created this myth and this aura behind him gohel said

save me
a man's voice cries out in the darkness
please save me
i can't see you she replies
i don't know where you are
save me
please save me
the voice pleads again
i want to she says
but i can't move either
when she wakes the voice is gone
in that cramped dark grave under seven hundred tons of concrete and steel she is all alone
the concept of purgatory isn't familiar to most bangladeshis
but the way reshma describes her seventeen harrowing days buried underground in pitch black darkness as the voices around her faded away as sweltering days bled into humid nights as she questioned whether she was in this world or the next it's an apt one
i'd crawl tire and sleep
i would wake up and crawl again reshma recounted her voice barely audible as she spoke to cnn on tuesday
it was one of her first extended one on one interviews since rescuers pulled her out alive last week from the rubble of a collapsed building
i told god take me if that's your will
if not then save me
but don't leave me here like this 
how did she survive 
the youngest in the family is often the most rebellious
and reshma the fifth child of her mother zubaida always had an independent streak
when she was little she preferred rolling a tire down the street with the boys to dressing up dolls with the girls
as a teen she surprised her family by marrying a man several years her elder
she was in love she told them and love has no boundaries
we accepted him zubaida said
but he wasn't good to her
he'd tell her that her family hadn't paid enough in dowry
he'd taunt her that he'd take another wife
and said her mother he tortured her
we gave as much as we could she said
but it wasn't enough
in june two thousand and ten the couple moved from dinjapur to dhaka the go to destination for the destitute looking to change their fortunes
a garment worker himself the husband persuaded reshma to join the trade
the money was good
and he snickered that it'd make up for what her parents weren't paying him zubaida said
unable to afford rent on her own reshma moved to a tiny room in a house next to the savar bazaar bus stop
savar once an undeveloped agricultural patch of land just outside dhaka has grown into a chaotic potholed boomtown home to a disproportionate number of the country's four thousand five hundred garment factories
and reshma quickly found a job at rana plaza a gargantuan nine story city block sized structure that housed shops a bank and five garment workshops
the sixty dollar she earned a month was twice the average for garment workers in bangladesh
still the loss of her husband's additional earnings meant she barely squeaked by
i have to find a way to chop this off reshma thinks
her long dark hair is caught under a slab of concrete
every time she tries to move large chunks of hair are pulled out of her head
she feels around in the darkness to see what she can find
she is now free to explore on her hands and knees this dust choked cocoon
when the first cracks appeared in the exterior walls of rana plaza the news spread among the workers in quick murmurs
the building was built without the right permits on land that used to be a pond officials now say
the weak foundation was threatened even further when the owner added four floors to what was once a five story structure
generators hummed on the fourth floor sometimes so loudly that workers said they could feel the structure vibrate
but all this was revealed after the fact
after rana plaza pancaked on april twenty four
after it claimed more than one thousand one hundred lives
on april twenty three the owner sohel rana called in an engineer to inspect the building and appease worker concerns
the engineer officials later said took one look at support pillars on the third floor and was horrified
the fissures were deep and many
the building is unsound he said
no one should be inside
this building will stand a hundred years he boasted that day
the factory owners were relieved
political unrest in the country has meant frequent general strikes and a backlog of orders for them
they couldn't afford a work stoppage if they intended to keep their foreign clients happy
the industry generates more than twenty billion dollar a year making the country the second largest exporter of clothing after china
so they gave the workers an ultimatum
miss work miss pay
the next morning at work reshma and others checked out the cracks
they looked ominous
the managers said that's just water damage
go back to work she said
she did taking her spot among the long rows of sewing machines at new wave bottoms
an hour later the power failed
then came a loud rumble
pillars crashed
support beams punched through windows
dust and debris clogged the air
the ceiling raced toward reshma
and the floors gave way
then she blacked out
reshma crawls across the rubble with the little strength she can muster
water she tells herself
i have to find water
she'd found a little in a bottle soon after the fall
but how long ago was that 
hours 
days 
weeks 
in this darkness she can't tell
the anguished cries around her stopped a long time ago
the man who'd begged her for help was the last voice
she drags through the detritus her clothing ripping to shreds
she pokes bricks with a rod
one tiny space leads to another
each an air pocket within the sandwiched structure
she scavenges for food
the four crackers she'd found in the ruins and rationed carefully are gone
what she really needs is water
with cupped palms she pours it down her parched throat
i didn't know if it was rainwater or dirty water or what type of water she later says
it didn't matter
she doesn't know it but she's in the flooded basement of rana plaza
it's one hundred and seventy miles from dinajpur to dhaka a trek along congested roads that can take up to ten hours
reshma's mother heard of the collapse on tv
but there was no way for her to reach her daughter
reshma had sold her mobile phone three days earlier to help pay rent
scrounging up what little change she had lying around zubeida boarded a bus to the capital
she checked the morgue and the hospitals
she showed a picture of reshma to every rescuer she met
no one had seen her
for the first few days she steadfastly held on to hope
rescuers had been pulling out survivors from the rubble by the dozens each day
more than two thousand of them in all
but as the days passed the number dwindled
and with it died zubeida's hopes
she wandered aimlessly around the disaster site
strangers brought her rice offered her an umbrella consoled her
i wanted my daughter's body she said
i wanted a leg or an arm or anything that i could take home and bury
three minutes without air
three days without water
three weeks without food
that's the survival rule of thumb
in reshma's case circumstances conspired to keep her alive
the air that seeped into the crevices
the crackers she found
the water she drank
the complete darkness may have helped too doctors say
without knowing day from night she couldn't keep track of time
she didn't know officials had determined there was little chance someone could survive past a week under that mountainous pile
she was unaware that the rescue mission had long given way to an operation to recover the dead
and sometimes the not knowing keeps one going
what was that 
reshma wonders
she strains to hear
there it is again the mellifluous tones of the muslim call to prayer
where's the sound coming from 
where's the sound coming from 
she keeps asking herself
with a new urgency she bangs on the walls of mangled metal and cement around her
then she sees a sliver of light
bachao
bachao
she calls out
save me
save me
but no one hears her
she takes another rod
with all her might she jams it through an opening above her
allah she keeps saying
allah save me
it wasn't lost on lt. col. moazzem hossain that the mood at the disaster site was changing
determination was slowly giving way to dejection
the pungent stench of death permeated the air
rescue workers covered their faces with t shirts to escape the smell of decaying flesh
it seeped into their clothes crawled inside their skin and lungs
each body they pulled out took an emotional toll as well
the number of volunteers had thinned
by friday rescuers had finished scouring the rubble and were drilling their way to the building's basement
the recovery operation was almost over
they hadn't found a survivor in almost a week
then someone noticed a rod jutting out from an opening waving wildly
slackjawed with disbelief elated with wonder they rushed to the spot
someone was down there alive
she kept saying save me save me hossain said
we told her we weren't going anywhere
a roar went through the crowds that had gathered at the sight
television channels immediately switched to live coverage
almighty god you make anything possible said a man on a loudspeaker as he urged others to pray
please help us save her
for forty five minutes workers used hand drills and light hammers to remove concrete blocks
wait wait we're coming for you
minutes from rescue reshma finds herself facing a very ordinary dilemma
how am i going to come out in front of all these people with no clothes 
she thinks
i'm a lady
hers had ripped to shreds from all the crawling
a rescuer tosses her a flashlight and she looks around
piles of clothes are everywhere spilling out of crushed boxes
she picks a purple shalwar kameez and wraps a bright pink scarf around her neck and chest
her face is covered with dirt but she looks fine she thinks
then she waits to emerge from the earth
lt. col. sharif ahmed is the commanding officer of the combined military hospital in savar where reshma is recovering
he marvels at how rapid her readjustment has been
reshma whose age is listed in hospital papers as twenty two is gaining strength every day
when she came here she'd startle to the touch he said
she'd have flashbacks if she tried to sleep
all normal considering what she went through
now she's smiling sitting up
and she's inseparable from her mother
the two hadn't always gotten along
my heart is bursting with joy zubeida said
i begged god and he returned her
sohel rana is in jail nabbed by police as he tried to flee to india
the owners of the factories in rana plaza are also in detention
on tuesday after twenty one days the rescue and recovery efforts formally ended
the disaster has spurred the government and foreign retailers to take a long hard critical look at factory safety standards and their roles in policing it
as for reshma she doesn't know what her future holds
but she knows she's not going back to the garment business
she ended our interview with a simple request
everybody please pray for me
with the joy she brought to a nation in mourning many already are

former british prime minister tony blair's attempt to spread the festive cheer turned into a turkey after social media users mocked his new christmas card
blair issued his annual christmas card on monday
it features a photo of him with a forced grimace on his face standing next to his wife cherie alongside the caption season's greetings
the unnatural looking smile quickly became the source of online derision with twitter users quick to compare the image to a range of gurning icons from count orlock from nosferatu and friends chandler bing
carlmaxim noted that the strange thing about tony blair's christmas card is how the teeth seem to follow you round the room
other users decided to do their own version of the card
some took the opportunity for some admittedly outdated political satire
user generalboles superimposed blair's successor gordon brown's face onto blair's and tweeted come on tony it's my turn a reference to brown waiting for blair to step down as prime minister and repeatedly telling him it's my turn now
others took the culture route with rowland seventy two james superimposing the couple's faces onto louis xvi and marie antoinette while garboy photoshopped their faces onto the notoriously unsmiling grant wood painting american gothic
when asked about the card a spokesperson for blair's office told cnn
we do not officially release the card cards are sent to their friends and colleagues which doesn't seem to me to be that unusual a process let alone one which merits such interest

francesco schettino captain of the wrecked costa concordia cruise ship took the stand for the first time tuesday combative and contradicting the testimony of not just his first captain but also what he has said in the past about the deadly shipwreck
schettino who is charged with manslaughter causing a maritime disaster and abandoning ship with passengers still on board denies wrongdoing
he faces up to twenty three years in prison if convicted
he remained defiant even while painting a picture of confusion on board the ship as the disaster unfolded pointing the finger at others for the chaotic evacuation of the ship's passengers
five of the captain's co workers have already entered guilty pleas in the case including officers who were on the ship
these pleas may work against schettino as he answers questions with regard to the co workers testimony before the court in grosseto
when shown the deposition given by his first captain ciro ambrosio who pleaded guilty to manslaughter in exchange for a lighter sentence schettino was argumentative and gesticulated wildly
what ambrosio told the court in his testimony is similar to the version of events schettino has given in past tv interviews but the captain contradicted that version in his testimony tuesday
schettino's attorneys argued that what the captain has previously said on italian tv can not be used as evidence in court
the disputed testimony deals with such details as radar readings who was on the bridge at the time of the accident and where those people were positioned
speaking to cnn during a court break schettino said he was confident about how his trial was progressing
it is exhausting but i think it is going well schettino said of tuesday's hearing
it is important because this is the only chance i have to tell my version of events
asked if he thought the court was sympathetic to him he said this is the first time i have had a chance to officially address the court personally so this should be the first time they should be judging me
i am confident
his testimony is expected to continue wednesday and probably one day next week
the cruise liner capsized after it struck rocks off italy's giglio island in the tyrrhenian sea on january twelve two thousand and twelve
no one died on impact but thirty two lives were lost during the subsequent chaotic evacuation of some four thousand two hundred people on board the ship
schettino was sworn in under a giant sign reading the law is equal for everyone in a makeshift courtroom in grosetto's red velvet teatro moderno
as assistant prosecutor alessandro leopizzi questioned schettino the captain described a scene of utter chaos on the bridge both before and after the accident
at one point he explained how it was common to invite passengers and guests on the bridge and said they often tipped him
i said there couldn't be more than twelve people at a time he said
and they would bring twenty thirty seventy euro a tour
he acknowledged frequently conducting flyby activities deviating from the planned route to go closer to certain places with his cruise ship
it was favorable from a commercial aspect he said
when the prosecutor asked if he had ever done a flyby past giglio before he said he couldn't remember but might have passed close by
not trying to blame anyone 
schettino also explained why he chose giglio on this occasion telling the court that he thought retired costa capt
mario palombo was on the island
when the prosecutor asked schettino why he called palombo and then why he asked palombo how deep the coastal waters were he said he was just making conversation
schettino recounted how he gave the orders to the helmsman jacob rusli bin of indonesia to go off course after using his binoculars to look ahead
when asked if his helmsman caused the accident he said
i'm not trying to blame anyone
i'm just trying to explain the circumstances
the captain has suggested rusli bin did not speak english or italian well enough to understand his orders although audiotape played in court tuesday appeared to contradict that
pushed as to why he used his binoculars instead of relying on the radar schettino said it was my habit to take my binoculars and look first
not that i didn't trust the radar but it was how i did it
he was confident that the ship had enough room for the maneuver he said
in an audiotape played over the radar from the bridge extracted from the ship's data recorder schettino told his helmsman to turn otherwise we go on the rocks
asked why he made that comment he said he was being ironic
a few minutes later i was told the danger we were in
schettino appeared visibly shaken putting his head in his hands shortly after radar and audio recordings of the moment of impact were played in court
bells and alarms rang and then the recording went offline
the prosecutor asked schettino about his last words captured on tape
but where did we touch 
the captain asked to which someone said oh my dear god
schettino also will be cross examined by a number of civil parties at the court
they include the attorney for a moldovan dancer who dined with the captain and was with him on the command bridge at the time of the shipwreck
before the hearing began schettino's attorney domenico pepe told cnn his client was ready to tell the truth
we have waited a long time to set the record straight he said
he is ready to defend his honor
schettino has repeatedly presented a defiant face over the shipwreck
he has pointed the finger at the costa cruise company for not providing maps with the rocks he hit appropriately marked
schettino has also blamed the ship saying generators did not work so the elevators did not function which hindered some people's escape



al shabaab militants raided a quarry in kenya separating non muslim workers from their muslim counterparts and executing them a spokesman for the group said tuesday
at least thirty six bodies were found tuesday dumped in the quarry in the village of kormey near the somali border the kenyan red cross said
al shabaab said the attack was retaliation for mosque raids that kenyan security forces carried out last month to weed out extremists
kormey is about fifteen kilometers from the border city of mandera in an area where the somalia based al shabaab militants are known to operate
last month the islamist militants ambushed a bus in kenya and sprayed bullets on those who failed to recite quran verses killing at least twenty eight people authorities said
the bus which had sixty people aboard was heading from mandera to the capital of nairobi
the group says the latest attacks are a response to the police raid on multiple mosques in the port city of mombasa after explosives were found in one
our mujhahideen forces are always ready to launch frequent deadly cross border attacks against kenya as a revenge group spokesman sheikh ali dheere said in a statement read on a pro al shabaab radio station in somalia
after news of the quarry attack surfaced kenyan president uhuru kenyatta said he accepted the resignation of the country's national police chief david kimaiyo
kenyatta said the recent attacks constituted a war and a war we must win
tuesday's attack was swiftly condemned with nairobi's jamia mosque the largest in the country calling it a beastly tactic
this unfortunate and ugly incident should not be used to divide peace loving kenyans who have lived harmoniously for centuries along religious or ethnic lines the mosque said in a statement but rather it should be taken to reflect on improving the security situation of the country
al shabaab which has ties to al qaeda has launched a series of attacks in kenya since kenyan forces went into neighboring somalia in two thousand and eleven to battle the extremists
kenyan soldiers have targeted militants hideouts across somalia prompting retaliatory attacks from the terror group
last year al shabaab raided a nairobi mall in a brazen attack that left sixty eight people dead and kept shoppers under siege for days
in addition to kenya and somalia the terror group has struck in uganda where it killed more than seventy people gathered to watch a broadcast of the world cup final soccer match in kampala in two thousand and ten
as the attacks get more daring the international community has rallied to battle the militants
in september a u.s. airstrike killed al shabaab leader ahmed godane
the terror group later replaced him and vowed to avenge his death

hong kong's teenage protest leader joshua wong has begun a hunger strike with two members of his youth activist group scholarism in his latest attempt to secure talks with the government to demand democracy
i know it is really harmful to my body however it is the only way to give pressure to the government to get a meeting with us wong told cnn
if the government can have a proper meeting with scholarism to discuss whether political reform will be launched immediately we will stop the hunger strike
the eighteen year old activist wants open elections for hong kong's next leader but beijing has said hong kong may only hold elections if candidates are nominated by a small committee
read more
who is joshua wong 
wong's hunger strike is an attempt to rally a movement which has shown growing signs of fracture
protesters have camped more than two months on an eight lane highway in hong kong's admiralty district but the government has shown no willingness to make concessions
the movement's momentum has sputtered and leaders of different protest groups are split over what action to take
hong kong's chief executive c.y
leung responded to news of the hunger strike by telling students to take care of their health especially in this cold weather
the city's temperature has dipped to a crisp fifteen degrees celsius after months of heat and humidity
wong says he will only consume water
we are all tired 
reactions were mixed to wong's announcement of the hunger strike
kid you're too young
you think will give you real universal suffrage because of a hunger strike 
said one commenter
other democracy supporters accused wong of staging the hunger strike as a way of achieving a glorious retreat without accomplishing anything
an online statement issued by scholarism acknowledged the hunger strike was a desperate measure
we are all tired our hearts are weary
as we face this high wall of a government we are like a weak frail egg it said
but we are not afraid of people laughing at our dreams
we are afraid of hearing the sounds of our broken dreams in the future afraid of having no more dreams at all
scholarism is not new to hunger strikes
in two thousand and twelve members of the group staged a hunger strike outside hong kong's government headquarters to oppose a proposed pro communist high school curriculum
after vocal protests from thousands of supporters officials eventually withdrew the plan
not long after wong's hunger strike began the three middle aged founders of the occupy central movement announced they would not escalate their actions but would instead surrender to police
for the sake of the occupiers safety for the sake of our original intention of love and peace as we prepare to surrender we three urge the students to retreat law professor benny tai announced at a press conference
tai first came up with the idea to occupy downtown hong kong to call for universal suffrage but he has not always seen eye to eye with students leaders who kicked off the current protests two months ago
many of hong kong's committed protesters do not consider the occupy founders to be their leaders and are unlikely to be influenced by tai's call for retreat
wong told cnn if the occupy founders want students to retreat then should urge the government to get a discussion with the students
student leaders have grown increasingly desperate for a breakthrough
on sunday night student leaders called on supporters to surround hong kong's government headquarters sunday night leading to a violent nighttime standoff with police in which protesters were bloodied and ultimately beaten back
the next morning police briefly moved on the main protest site removing some tents banners and barricades before withdrawing
student leader alex chow twenty four of the hong kong federation of students bowed his head in an apology to supporters monday
we aimed to disrupt the operation of the government
but the plan had room to improve and in a sense it failed
before dawn monday at least forty arrests had been made in admiralty according to the hong kong police
a further twelve people were also arrested in mong kok
the central government office was closed on monday morning but later re opened
the government said it condemned violent radicals saying they had provoked and verbally abused police officers and encouraged others to charge police lines
protesters
we do not have any plan 
wong was briefly arrested last week as police forcefully cleared hong kong's second largest protest site in the working class neighborhood of mong kok
now as the main protest site comes under threat protesters have been at a loss for how to best respond
arguments broke out monday between student leaders and demonstrators after police made an incursion into the tent city
winnie ng a demonstrator told cnn we do not have any plan
grassroots demonstrators have argued the movement should escalate its physical confrontations with the government
but the orginators of the occupy movement among them benny tai and professor chan kin man have repeatedly called on students to withdraw and think of a new strategy citing opinion polls that show low support for the street occupations
in a poll in november just thirteen percents of hong kongers surveyed said the occupations should continue

lionel messi and cristiano ronaldo find themselves fighting it out for fifa's ballon d'or award once again but the contest between the world's two highest profile footballers isn't only being played out on the pitch
bayern munich's german international goalkeeper manuel neuer was the other player on the three man shortlist revealed monday with ronaldo the overwhelming favorite to take the award
which means there is no sign of barcelona's messi and real madrid poster boy ronaldo's domination of the back pages ending any time soon
both are so globally known that that their every facebook posting is worth thousands of dollars for brands associated with the two players while the allure of their names helps shift any and every product with which they are associated
but who is the most marketable 
is it messi the newly crowned all time la liga top scorer 
or is it ronaldo the current ballon d'or holder and a man seemingly able to score goals at will no matter what the competition 
sports marketing research company repucom examined fifteen different markets ranging from spain to the u.s. and found that portugal skipper ronaldo is the better known of the two
ninety two percents know of him while eighty seven percents have heard of messi
the figures also show that the same number of men know about messi as women know about ronaldo ninety one percents
they reveal that ronaldo sells more effectively with eighty six percents of those questioned regarding the ex manchester united man as an influential brand spokesman
cristiano ronaldo dominates in terms of his overall marketability largely because of the consistently high levels of awareness people have of him around the world whilst messi has a greater proportion of people that do know of him saying they like him said repucom's global head of research mike wragg
that repucom says makes the real star the most marketable footballer in the world
one leading academic believes ronaldo's increasingly growing brand off the pitch is testament to the way his management team have packaged him as a formal business proposition in contrast to messi
there is a clear and deliberate strategic intent on the part of the ronaldo and his business representatives simon chadwick professor of sport business strategy and marketing at england's coventry university told cnn
the intention has been to create and position a brand that provides consumers with a differential advantage over its rivals
we've seen the development of the cr seven brand which ronaldo has used as the basis for the development of his commercial activities
whereas messi was always viewed by many as the ultimate team player there has also been a shift in the way ronaldo is now presented to his audience says chadwick
from a man who has historically been perceived as being self centered and arrogant recently ronaldo's image has softened as the result of him paying for the medical treatment of a sick fan a young child
remember too that ronaldo had his hair cut in a particular way to mark his relationship with the boy
those actions have helped in shaping and fashioning the latest incarnation of the ronaldo brand
the data also shows that ronaldo's online clout is higher than messi's 
the real forward boasts more than one hundred and two million facebook followers with repucom calculating his average facebook post value in two thousand and fourteen to be worth one hundred and forty three thousand seven hundred and fifty dollar
messi on the other hand has seventy five million facebook fans and average post value of sixty two thousand five hundred dollar
are we likely to see messi being marketed in a different way in the coming years 
i'm not convinced that messi or his advisors want this said chadwick
i think he's simply happy to play football and pick up some additional commercial income along the way
the academic argues there are complications in trying to come up with a compelling brand proposition for the argentine star
five years years ago his brand was something akin to childlike innocence someone who plays football for the joy of it
but now he has a child he is therefore not a child any more
and his tax case means that the brand may be perceived as not being innocent any more
one way for him to position the messi brand might be as a family man 
but given that he is not married this may not play out well among some market segments
meanwhile back in the footballing arena the statistics are more reassuring for messi even more so given he is two years younger than the twenty nine year old ronaldo
the camp nou talisman is la liga's goals record holder with two hundred and fifty three strikes to his name while ronaldo has one hundred and ninety seven
he is also the leading scorer in the champions league with seventy four goals a record held jointly with raul and only one ahead of ronaldo's tally of seventy one
and messi also has the greatest number of ballon d'or awards four with his real madrid rival having taken the accolade twice
ronaldo is portugal's leading all time goalscorer with fifty two while messi and gabriel batistuta share the record of most goals scored in a year for argentina each striking twelve times
messi has hit forty four goals in ninety five games for his country overall
so these stars will fight it out for the ballon d'or award unless manuel neuer spoils the party

a u.s. air force pilot was killed when the f sixteen fighting falcon he was flying crashed in an noncombat incident in jordan officials said

a u.s. official told cnn the crash happened in jordan
pentagon spokesman col. steve warren said the plane suffered maintenance problems after takeoff and then crashed as it attempted to return
although it was a noncombat incident the jet was headed to a combat mission warren said
per military policy the pilot's name was not immediately released
air force pilot's remains found in gulf of mexico after f sixteen crash


even in street landscapes i like pictures where the building is looking back at you admits the spanish photographer
it was this fascination that inspired him to photograph the women of goree island off the coast of senegal
the powerful eyes of those girls
they are very dark and very deep
that's what attracted me to them he recalls
the women and the landscape reminded him of a powerful portraitist who defined much of his childhood
spanish painter julio romero de torres
la chiquita piconera is most famous painting and one of the most famous paintings in the spanish tradition he says
in the history of art when women are portrayed most of the time they're being looked at
i like portraits of women that look back at you and the woman in la chiquita piconera is looking back with a lot of dignity and a lot of strength
another defining feature of de torre's paintings says hirschfeld is the melancholy housed in their expressions
he found a similar sentiment in the goree's architecture
you can see that same melancholy in the crumbling buildings on the island he says
though the influence is spanish the props the fabrics the models and the setting are all local to senegal
rather than recreate the andalusian fashions donned by the women in de torres portraits hirschfeld picked fabrics from the senegalese markets and had dresses made by tailors on the island
in senegal they have an amazing tradition of tailors and they work really fast
in one day they can create these beautiful dresses which you can see in the pictures he says
hirschfeld's subjects also hold objects that reflect their culture
in de torres painting the fortune telling for instance one woman uses playing cards to give a psychic reading to her friend
in hirschfeld's version his models use cowrie shells a traditional senegalese fortune telling tool
i wanted to show that some emotions are universal and create a more universal portrait but i also wanted to create a more senegalese scene he says

flying above kruger national park veterinarian peter buss steps out onto the helicopter's skid and aims his rifle
below him a white rhino lumbers across the south african bush
as the helicopter swoops in low herding the animal closer to the road buss looks through the scope and fires a single shot
a flash of pink on the rump is all it takes to bring the two ton animal staggering to the ground where fellow veterinarians are ready and waiting armed with a blindfold
the wildlife veterinary team works quickly
an oxygen tube is inserted into the subdued rhino's nostril
blood hair and skin samples are taken for dna
then after another injection to partially reverse the effects of the tranquilizer the rhino is pulled to its feet and led into a trailer for the journey to safer ground away from this poaching hotspot along the mozambique border to a recently established intensive protection zone deeper into the park
the team's members are no ordinary veterinarians but daily captures like this one are quickly becoming the norm for a team tasked with the care of kruger's most threatened species
they've already conducted more than thirty relocations since last month and will conduct hundreds more
they are a key part of a protection plan which has taken on even greater urgency since the country's environmental minister announced that a record one thousand and twenty of south africa's rhinos have been poached this year
the illegal trade in rhino horn is fueled by an insatiable demand in asia where it is prized as a sign of wealth and believed to have medicinal value though there's no scientific evidence to support claims that it has healing properties
rhino horn is made of keratin the same protein found in human fingernails but it can still fetch as much as five thousand five hundred and fifty dollar an ounce on the black market that's more than the price of gold more than the price of platinum and roughly equivalent to the price of cocaine
kruger national park which is home to roughly ten thousand rhinos a quarter of the world's population shares a three hundred and fifty kilometer border with impoverished mozambique making it a massive target for poachers
we were rangers now we're at war the park's head of anti poaching major general johan jooste told cnn
but while new equipment and new technology has helped lead to a record number of poaching arrests this year it has done little to slow the slaughter
the general says his enemy has a nearly limitless supply of foot soldiers ready to cross the border and risk it all for small slice of the profit
last month alone six hundred poachers infiltrated the park from mozambique
once a poacher is in the park it's like a burglar in your home said jooste who admitted that in a park the size of israel military style patrols alone will never be enough to save kruger's rhinos and that much more needs to be done outside the park's boundaries

we made the decision that we are here for the living rhino not the dead jooste explained
there was a time when this park famous and now targeted for its prized rhinos had none
several relocations including one from one thousand nine hundred and sixty to one thousand nine hundred and seventy two that introduced three hundred rhinos helped grow kruger's population which reached its peak of twelve thousand two hundred rhinos in two thousand and ten

christianity is a religion frayed over the centuries into many denominations
on sunday pope francis and the head of a major one vowed to heal one of the church's oldest splits
the great schism of one thousand and fifty four separated the catholic and eastern orthodox churches
both profess similar doctrine and worship in similar ways but a millennium ago eastern orthodoxy rejected the ultimate authority of the pope
francis and patriarch bartholomew i the spiritual leader of some three hundred million orthodox christians worldwide signed a declaration on sunday committing to unity between the two churches
together they celebrated a divine liturgy at the patriarchal church of st. george in istanbul on francis last day in the predominantly muslim nation his first trip there
somber intonations and hymns reverberated through the church as the two spiritual leaders prayed and offered reflections and francis tried to allay worries
neither church will submit to nor assimilate the other the pope said in his homily but they will work towards the restoration of full communion
i want to assure each one of you here that to reach the desired goal of full unity the catholic church does not intend to impose any conditions except that of the shared profession of faith francis said
he was at st. george's at the patriarch's invitation which he extended shortly after francis inauguration
sunday's celebrations marked the feast of st. andrew the founder of the eastern church
he was also the older brother of st. peter the founding father of the catholic church
in his part of the call for unity the orthodox leader alluded to attacks by radical islamists on christians
we no longer have the luxury of isolated action bartholomew said
the modern persecutors of christians do not ask which church their victims belong to
the unity that concerns us is regrettably already occurring in certain regions of the world through the blood of martyrdom
over the past decade first al qaeda and then isis have forced christians to flee iraq and syria
far fewer christians remain in areas under isis control
some rely on their faith in god
others pay terrorists a protection tax
growing numbers especially from syria have ended up in turkey.the nation is reeling from the influx of around one point five million syrian refugees the vast majority muslim
religion is also splitting turkey
opponents fear its conservative government will weaken the secular identity of the post ottoman empire
instability rages at its border with isis and its leader abu bakr al baghdadi announcing their intention to take over large swaths of territory for their self proclaimed islamic state
francis is the fourth pope to travel to turkey following in the footsteps of paul vi john paul ii and benedict xvi
the pope was also expected to meet with young people from the salesian community from turkey the middle east and africa before heading to the airport later sunday
salesians the second largest catholic order help orphans and at risk children according to their website
on friday the first day of his visit francis called for religious tolerance and dialogue to counter extremism in the middle east as he met with turkey's leaders
fanaticism and fundamentalism as well as irrational fears which foster misunderstanding and discrimination need to be countered by the solidarity of all believers he said
the world is morally obligated to help turkey care for the great number of refugees it has taken in francis said
in an address given in francis presence turkish president recep tayyip erdogan highlighted what he said was a disturbing trend of increased racism and islamophobia in the west while islamist extremism wracks parts of the middle east
the world must come together if it wants to combat terrorism he said
the turkish leader also suggested the west should not turn a blind eye to abuses committed by syrian president bashar al assad while it pursues isis
the timing of the pope's visit in this period of unrest is extremely significant erdogan added voicing hope that it would lead to an auspicious era of improved relations in the world

in the seething period of the effort for building a thriving country last year we took the resolute measure of removing the factionalists the north korean leader said in a new year's address shortly after the execution
days after the execution jang's wife suffered her third stroke according to kang myung do a defector who was son in law to north korea's ex prime minister kang sun san
she was on the phone with the north korean leader when she suffered the stroke kang said
she was hospitalized and later died

as the troop sergeant i was there to motivate the guys and get them fired up again to go out and do the job

but no one was doing that for me farthing said earlier this year
my time with this dog was a way of de stressing collecting my thoughts and popping my head back in the game

the group's shelter and clinic in kabul are staffed by fourteen afghan nationals four of whom are trained veterinarians

to date nowzad dogs has reunited nearly seven hundred soldiers with the animals they adopted in afghanistan
i know that the dog i looked after was my saving grace from the stress of conflict farthing said
and because of that initial bond the work goes on
reuniting soldiers with their companions tackling rabies and training veterinarians in kabul
i would like to thank everybody for their support
we're making a difference for the afghan people the soldiers and one dog and cat at a time

prince harry co founded the sentebale charity with lesotho's prince seeiso in two thousand and six after being struck by the impact of aids hiv on children and young people in the southern african nation
throughout the day celebrities including singer joss stone actor charley boorman race car driver daniel ricciardo and former rugby player and sport commentator will greenwood will be revealing secrets about themselves as part of feelnoshame
television presenter luke franks has already revealed that he sometimes wears ladies jeans for a better fit while footballer christian eriksen admitted eating all his advent calendar chocolates early
wearing the red ribbon of the aids awareness campaign prince harry revealed his secret in a video message released at one p.m. gmt
my secret is believe it or not i get incredibly nervous before public speaking no matter how big the crowd or the audience and um despite the fact that i laugh and joke all the time i get incredibly nervous if not anxious actually before going into rooms full of people when i'm wearing a suit he said
and now that i've confessed that i'll probably be even more worried that people are looking at me
world aids day has been held every december one since one thousand nine hundred and eighty eight and is aimed at increasing awareness of the virus and raising funds to combat its effects
prince harry earlier posted a message on youtube on behalf of sentebale to mark world aids day in which he said the virus was the no
one cause of death across africa and second highest cause of death globally for those aged ten to nineteen
one tragic issue in particular is the shame and stigma linked to hiv he said
this causes thousands of children to needlessly die each year because they're keeping their illness a secret and not getting the medical attention that they need
he said sentebale encouraged children to talk openly about their health concerns
to show our support to the children of lesotho and help reduce the stigma for all those affected by hiv we are turning this world aids day into a day in which no one should feel any shame about their secrets prince harry said
myself and many others will be sharing secrets of our own throughout the day and we ask everyone else to do the same
please use the hashtag feelnoshame to share your secret on social media and show the children of lesotho that they are not alone
together we can tackle the stigma surrounding hiv and give the young people carrying it the treatment that they deserve the childhood so many of us take for granted

expensive works of art offered as inducements are at the center of the latest series of damaging allegations around the bidding process for the two thousand and eighteen and two thousand and twenty two world cups a published report claimed
a painting believed to be a picasso was allegedly gifted to union of european football associations president and fifa executive member michel platini in return for his support for the eventually successful russian bid for the two thousand and eighteen global showpiece
another fifa voting member michel d'hooghe from belgium was also the recipient of a landscape painting given to him in a package wrapped in brown paper by viacheslav koloskov a former russian executive committee member working for his nation's attempt to host the two thousand and eighteen tournament it is alleged in a report in the sunday times
allegations in the sunday times relating to my actions in the two thousand and eighteen and two thousand and twenty two bidding processes are total fabrications said former french international star platini
the matter has now been passed to my legal advisers
read
whistleblower who took on fifa power brokers
d'hooghe told the sunday times that he believed the painting given to him was absolutely ugly and he believed it had no value
he said he had not voted for the russian bid
the newspaper's latest revelations are based on evidence it supplied to a uk parliamentary committee which itself has been investigating the circumstances around the award of the world cup host countries particularly in the light of england's failed bid for the two thousand and eighteen competition
the house of commons culture media and sport committee has now published details of the investigations by the sunday times which claim the england bid commissioned high level intelligence gathering and and surveillance on the other countries bidding to host the two thousand and eighteen and two thousand and twenty two world cups
it also claims england's bid used private security companies and a former member of the uk government's intelligence service mi six to gather information on its rivals
the previously unreported material contains a series of claims around the role allegedly played by russian president vladimir putin in making sure his country would host football's premier competition hard on the heels of winning the rights to stage the sochi winter olympics earlier this year
it claims that putin was initially skeptical about russia's bid but had later thrown his full weight behind the process
he took a personal interest in the running of the bid in mid two thousand and ten the committee report reveals
under the heading intelligence relating to russia two thousand and eighteen a series of allegations are revealed about putin's role in brokering a major bilateral trade deal for gas with qatar the winners of the two thousand and twenty two bid in exchange for each others votes and the votes of others of their supporters
the allegations also detail the plundering of russia's national art collection either from the vaults of the state hermitage museum in st.petersburg or the kremlin archives as alleged kickbacks to platini and d'hooghe
in a statement given to cnn officials behind the russian bid have also strongly denied any wrongdoing
russia two thousand and eighteen categorically rejects all of the allegations made in the sunday times today as entirely unfounded speculation it said
these allegations are not new but the evidence has only ever indicated that russia two thousand and eighteen behaved professionally and fairly throughout the bidding process
the russia two thousand and eighteen bid committee operated in full compliance with the spirit and letter of fifa's code of ethics and sought to abide by the fifa bidding guidelines at all times
this kind of speculation will not affect russia two thousand and eighteen's focus on doing what we have been doing for nearly four years already
making great progress towards our objective of hosting the best ever fifa world cup in two thousand and eighteen
the alleged pivotal role of fifa president sepp blatter in the bidding process is also highlighted in the published reports of the dcms and the sunday times
the claim is made that blatter and putin jointly hit the phones to drum up votes for russia on the eve of the secret ballot in zurich on december two two thousand and ten
blatter was absolutely committed to the russian bid it was said
earlier this month football's world governing body published a report that cleared russia and qatar of any wrongdoing in their winning of the hosting rights for the two thousand and eighteen and two thousand and twenty two world cups
but within hours of the announcement michael garcia the u.s. attorney who had led the investigation went public with his disappointment at the findings labeling them incomplete and erroneous and claiming that his work had been misrepresented
the saga took a further twist when fifa later announced it had lodged a criminal complaint in the swiss courts into the possible misconduct of individual persons in connection with the awarding of the hosting rights of the two thousand and eighteen and two thousand and twenty two world cup
fifa told cnn sunday that it was unable to comment on the specific allegations in the dcms and sunday times reports
matters related to the two thousand and eighteen two thousand and twenty two inquiry are solely handled by the investigatory chamber of the independent fifa ethics committee it said
therefore we are not in a position to comment on on going proceedings nor on names and other information circulated in the media particularly as we do not know against which individuals and for what reasons investigations are in process nor do we know the details of what is actually in the investigation reports
it added
the independent chairman of the audit and compliance committee domenico scala is currently evaluating the matter to decide on the next steps including the compiling of relevant information from the investigation which needs to be provided to the fifa executive committee
in parallel the entire reports have been provided to the swiss general attorney
as such fifa has no further comment for the time being
meanwhile the english football association also responded sunday to the reports claiming that the two thousand and eighteen bid chairman andy anson and his team had fully co operated with the original fifa investigation
the fifa ethics committee made specific requests and responding to these requests involved searching in excess of five hundred thousand documents the guardian newspaper reported
the search parameters were established with mr garcia's office
the documents searched included intelligence gathered by the bid team
all documents within the search parameters were disclosed
it added that anson had only shared with garcia information that could be substantiated
everything else was hearsay gossip and rumor it added
the uk parliament is set to debate the findings of the dcms report monday

it's the picture we needed to see after the past week's turmoil
a twelve year old black boy tears streaming down his face and a white police officer embrace in the middle of a ferguson related demonstration in portland oregon
the story behind the image is just as touching
the boy devonte hart was holding a sign offering free hugs during a tuesday protest over a grand jury's decision not to indict ferguson police officer darren wilson
portland police sgt
bret barnum approached devonte and extended his hand
barnum said he approached devonte not as a police officer but just a human being when he saw him crying
devonte seemed hesitant to talk at first but barnum said he broke the ice by talking about life travel and summer vacations before asking for a hug
the situation itself is something police officers do every day when they go out on the street and make citizen contacts barnum said
the oregonian newspaper was the first media outlet to publish the photo by twenty year old freelance photographer johnny nguyen
within hours of its posting on facebook the photo had been shared more than one hundred and fifty thousand times leading the oregonian to call it the hug shared around the world
i really believe in my heart that this is what most people want to find the common good in all people and find things we can agree on not fight about one facebook commenter said
i love this picture and wish that little boy the best life has to offer
barnum said he was surprised by the overwhelming response but really happy to be part of something that imparted a sense of peace in troubled times
it solidified what all of us do this work for this job for to create good will he said
nguyen said he attended the rally to take pictures for himself
when i came across devonte who was holding a free hugs sign and tears running down his face i knew right there and then there was something special about him he said
my gut told me to stay at the scene despite other photo opportunities in the crowd
nguyen captured a few snaps of devonte and then turned around to get some shots of other people
when he turned back he saw devonte speaking to barnum
i thought what a great scene
a powerful scene
a scene with a message that needed to be communicated
a scene of coming together he said
they hugged it out and i got as close as i could and snapped away
the photo spread like wildfire in a day
nguyen said he has received hundreds of emails and messages saying how the photograph made people feel more hopeful that it restored faith in humanity or brought them to tears
i knew it had something special something powerful
it had a message i think everyone wanted to see he said
i think it goes to show everybody was clamoring for hope in the midst of the violence and conflict going on today
i'm glad my photo has done that
yes i'm a photographer but in the end i'm a human being who wants better for other human beings and i'm glad i can play my part by sharing the incredible photo
i wish to see everyone continue to be positive and spread love always
cnn's facebook audience appeared to agree
as one commenter said this is a powerful message
i applaud you young man
sending you a cyber hug
what did you think of this picture

motilal kushwaha had promised the hindu goddess gadhimai that he would offer her a male goat if one of his children found a job
last year his son was successful and on saturday he was one of tens of thousands of people killing the animals at the temple of gadhimai in southern nepal as part of the biggest religious mass slaughter in the world
from my village everyone has made a vow to offer animals says kushwaha from bariyarpur a community in bara district about sixty miles south of kathmandu
some he explains are glad they have got a son or a daughter others that a different form of good fortune has befallen them
the ritual sacrifice of goats buffaloes and roosters in temples and at home is widespread in nepal where eighty percent of the population are hindu
some five million people from adjoining districts and also from the bordering indian states of bihar and uttar pradesh will attend the festival according to local authorities although only two days are dedicated to the sacrificial ritual itself
the slaughter follows a set pattern
on friday male water buffalo calves are killed while on saturday attentions switches to goats
officials estimate that up to ten thousand buffalo calves and one hundred and fifty thousand goats will be offered to gadhimai the goddess of power during the ritual
watch a cnni report on the ritual
but these numbers will be much lower than those of two thousand and nine the last time the five yearly gadhimai festival took place thanks to advocacy efforts by animal rights activists
in that year nearly twenty thousand buffalo calves were killed according to temple officials and more than two hundred thousand goats were slaughtered
we object to the cruelty with which animals are treated says pramada shah of animal welfare network nepal
there is random hacking of animals in open space
not all animals have their heads chopped off
some take up to forty minutes to die
the participants who hack the animals in an enclosed arena with large knives are licensed by the gadhimai festival management and development committee
this year about four hundred people will kill animals according to kushwaha who is also the committee's secretary
the animals not only suffer while they are being killed
they are also transported over long distances on foot
by the time they get to the festival venue they are half dead says shah
they are kept two or three days without food after they are brought here
activists have gone to the courts in nepal and india to halt the sacrifices
last month nepal's supreme court did not stop the animal sacrifices but ruled that existing laws have to be followed
if the existing laws are implemented there would be no ritual sacrifices says shambhu thapa the lawyer who filed the case explaining that only animals killed in a slaughterhouse are fit to be eaten
courts in india also directed the indian government not to control the unnecessary export of animals to nepal
the indian authorities for their part had directed security agencies and state governments to check the flow of livestock to the neighboring country
in a letter to the uttar pradesh government seen by cnn india's home ministry estimated in september as many as ninety thousand buffaloes would be illegally transported to nepal for the festival
but animals continue to flow into nepal through the porous and open border
the border can not be controlled and corruption is endemic says shah
nepalese authorities are also reluctant to stop the ritual sacrifice
we can not do this explains chief district officer dulal
we can not speak against it
this is something to do with culture
kushwaha adds
if we tell the people to stop the sacrifices they will come to kill us
this is something related to people's religion and faith
hindu religion does not support the ritual sacrifice of animals says shah
we consulted religious priests on the matter she says
activists in gadhimai meanwhile are confident that there will be changes in people's attitudes
uttimlal chaurasiya from bariyarpur claims that some forty percent of the women in the village have said that they will not sacrifice animals
three years ago he started a campaign showing videos of cruelty to animals at the festival to villagers
while awareness is being raised at a local level he believes binding laws are still needed to stop the sacrifices
all living creatures are equal in the eyes of god he says
instead of animals we can offer gourds pumpkins coconuts and sweets to the goddess
the festival management committee can not stop the animal sacrifices but if the government asks the committee can discuss the issue says kushwaha
shah and other activists had been working with the government since the last festival in two thousand and nine to stop the sacrifices but although there was some progress a government decision was not reached
meanwhile on friday morning tens of thousands of people gathered around the temple in bara district southern nepal waiting for the sacrificial ritual to begin
people seem to be in a merry mood and look like they have been waiting for this moment for ages says niraj gautam an animal welfare activist from bariyarpur
but it is a sad day for us
he estimates six thousand to eight thousand water buffaloes will be randomly hacked not necessarily by having their heads chopped off
any part of the body can be cut he says
last time round we saw buffalo walking with their head hanging

the village of asola fatehpur beri is the strongest in india
for generations men have held two hour workouts every morning and evening in this countryside community on the southern rim of delhi
from pre teens to men nearing fifty bodybuilders sweat it out at one of the most popular training spots akhada which is a hindi word that means wrestling arena
this is where brawny men wrestle in mud climb ropes and perform a few hundred sit ups and push ups balancing their hands on bricks
they carry each other on their shoulders all part of the traditional indian way of working out
one lifts a three hundred and fifty kilogram motorcycle up to his chest
the group of about forty males exercises outside each wearing a simple loincloth
they eat healthy and on time they practice here everyday and that's why they are so strong says vijay tanwar the head trainer at akhada
the musclemen of asola fatehpur beri are capitalizing on their brawn by working as bouncers in new delhi's clubs and bars
as more nightspots open in india's capital there's a greater need for men to guard the doors and the musclemen from this rural village are filling most of that demand
tanwar is credited with starting this new trend
fifteen years ago he missed out on a place in india's wrestling team for the olympics
he says he was looking for an opportunity where he could use his muscle and power and so took a job as a bouncer
i was the first bouncer from this village he claims
then everyone followed my path
more than three hundred musclemen work as bouncers in new delhi's clubs and bars now
they've learned that pumping iron is a way to stay fit and earn a living
as they say health is wealth
we are healthy but we're also earning good money able to send kids to good schools eat well what else does one need in life 
he says
building muscle isn't only about becoming a bouncer in delhi
disciplined training is very important for these men and part of a tradition in the village
there are few modern gyms in the village but most men prefer the traditional style of working out tanwar says
it makes your body flexible and the risk of injury is less as well
the musclemen don't drink or smoke
and the majority of them are vegetarians with diets that consist mostly of fruit nuts yogurts and lots of milk
we do not consume any muscle enhancing supplements tanwar says
urged by his parents sonu tanwar nineteen gets up at five a.m. to go running and then to the akhada
tanwar who represents the younger generation of bodybuilders says
i want to be a great wrestler and make my parents proud
i play in the sixty six kilogram category and have won several championships
instilling a habit of working out in young males is important says guru lekhraj a seventy five year old native of the asola fatehpur village
children are prone to bad behavior between the age of seventeen and twenty seven but if we get the child interested in physical exercise and good health bad behavior will not be an influence
this is what our ancestors have taught us as well
who will teach if not the elders 
lekhraj comes to the akhada often to observe the men working out
he's a respected figure among the musclemen and is considered the bodybuilding guru of the village
due to lekhraj's age he can not participate in training anymore but says he is very happy the young generation is continuing the legacy
what mother doesn't want her son to be strong well built handsome and smart 
lekhraj says
in the case of asola fatehpur beri bodybuilding also means building a legacy

egyptian prosecutors say they will appeal after former ruler hosni mubarak was cleared of charges linking him to the deaths of hundreds of protesters during the country's two thousand and eleven uprising
the ruling was a stunning reversal for the ex president who had been convicted of ordering the killings of peaceful protesters and was sentenced to life in prison for the same charges two years ago
on saturday a cairo judge dismissed charges linking mubarak to the deaths of protesters during the two thousand and eleven revolt that led to the end of his twenty nine year rule
the judge also found him not guilty of corruption
the eighty six year old was stoic as his supporters in the courtroom cheered the decision that capped a months long retrial
reclining on a hospital gurney in a defendants cage he nodded while fellow defendants kissed him on the head
later he told the country's sada elbalad tv station in a brief phone interview that he didn't commit anything
i laughed when i heard the first verdict he said of the first trial which he appealed
when it came to the second verdict i said i was waiting
it would go either way
it wouldn't have made a difference to me either way
also acquitted saturday were mubarak's former interior minister habib el adly and six of el adly's aides who'd been accused of being connected to the deaths of two hundred and thirty nine protesters as security forces cracked down on them in two thousand and eleven
mubarak's two sons also were acquitted saturday of corruption
mubarak is still serving a three year sentence for a previous conviction for embezzlement handed down in may but it's not clear when he will be released because he is expected to be credited for time already served
both sides have alleged that mubarak's trials have been politicized with supporters arguing he was unfairly vilified and opponents fearing that he'd be acquitted as memories of the revolution faded
his legal fortunes did seem to parallel the political climate just last year mohamed morsy the islamist who became egypt's first democratically elected president supported a retrial with the backing of his supporters who argued mubarak should have received a death sentence rather than life in captivity
but morsy himself was deposed by the military in july two thousand and thirteen as opponents accused him of pursuing an islamist agenda at the exclusion of other factions
and now the arab spring revolt that ousted mubarak has come nearly full circle mubarak appears close to freedom
morsy is jailed his muslim brotherhood banned
and morsy supporters allege the current government has returned to mubarak's authoritarian practices
mubarak cleared but drama isn't over yet
judge mahmoud el rashidy said he dropped charges against mubarak because cairo criminal court didn't have the jurisdiction to try him for the protesters deaths
the judge said the case that prosecutors initially referred to the court listed only el adly and his aides as defendants not mubarak himself
but after mass protests pressured the prosecutor general to question mubarak a second referral was made to the court and the two cases were merged into one
lawyer hoda nasralla who represents the families of sixty five slain and injured protesters said the inclusion of mubarak in a second referral should have trumped his exclusion in the first
the judge shied away from directly acquitting mubarak even though he was accused of conspiring with adly and adly was acquitted she said
the judge resorted to formalities instead
salway el sayed mother of one of the slain two thousand and eleven protesters sat down on a sidewalk outside the court after she heard saturday's verdicts praying to god to deliver justice
she broke down in tears her hands shaking as she recalled her son tamer hanafy who was killed in january two thousand and eleven at cairo's tahrir square the epicenter of the uprising
i'm worried my son's blood would go in vain she said
our children's blood isn't cheap
their blood is precious like any other blood
i don't want execution she continued
this won't bring back my son
i want only god's retribution
nothing more
tahrir square was closed to traffic following saturday's verdicts
one man was killed and nine people were injured as several hundred demonstrators clashed nearby with egyptian security forces egyptian ministry of health spokesman hossam abdel ghaffar told cnn
police fired tear gas and bird shot at the protesters
the ministry of interior said police were pelted by rocks before the incident escalated
the human rights group egyptian initiative for personal rights whose lawyers represented more than sixty civil plaintiffs in the case said that saturday's verdict solidified the impunity that it says security forces and their leaders enjoy
justice was dealt another severe blow the group said in a news release
in january two thousand and eleven throngs of egyptians filled the streets of cairo to decry the country's poverty unemployment and repression
protesters called for mubarak to step down but were met by a fierce and often violent government crackdown
mubarak eventually stepped down in february two thousand and eleven
that freed up long supressed islamist movements including the muslim brotherhood to run for office
morsy backed by the brotherhood's freedom and justice party became president in june two thousand and twelve
but morsy was ousted in a coup about a year later amid widespread protests against his rule
since then cairo's military installed government has banned the brotherhood calling it a terrorist group an allegation it denies and accusing it of being behind a wave of deadly attacks on police and the military
many islamist and secular activists have been arrested and given lengthy sentences
a restrictive protest law and repeated deadly crackdowns on demonstrations followed
abdel fattah el sisi the general who led morsy's ouster was elected president in may after leaving the military to run for the office
since mubarak stepped down in february two thousand and eleven the ailing former ruler has appeared in court numerous times on a variety of charges often wheeled in on a gurney
his lawyers say he suffered health problems after his two thousand and eleven arrest including a stroke and he has served much of his prison time at a military medical facility
in may when a cairo court sentenced mubarak to three years in prison for embezzlement his sons gamal and alaa were sentenced to four years each on the same charge
all three were convicted of embezzling eighteen million dollar that was allocated for the renovation of presidential palaces
the mubaraks have insisted they are not guilty

these children hiding in slovyansk ukraine are looking at the camera of andrea rocchelli a young italian who died while photographing their stories
andy was a very sincere person said luca santese who co founded cesura a collaborative photo agency
he wasn't just about conquering the subjects
he was very sincere and dedicated to the stories he was doing
described by his cesura colleagues as young idealistic and very passionate rocchelli lived and breathed photography and storytelling
his last photographs some still stored in his camera project the maturity of a young man who by then had roamed confidently in dangerous war scenarios
let's say he was a real fighter said arianna arcara another cesura founding partner
arcara said rocchelli's bunker photos reflect the person he was and showed off his talent
when we saw those photos of the children in the bunker she said we knew we were dealing with some very potent images

he had reached maturity he was on the cusp of something
rocchelli was barely thirty years old when mortar shells obliterated his convoy in may near slovyansk
authorities are still investigating the circumstances surrounding his death
his untimely death came as his work took on a more compositional aspect one of an artist santese said
he had found a language an aesthetic that was very efficient not only to document but to project emotions he said
many of rocchelli's photos had the imprint of a documentarian testaments on the injustice criminality and despair in the ukrainian conflict
other shots especially of children as they inhabit the war landscape are enveloped with softness and protection
photographing these children in dark bunkers and hiding spaces rocchelli creates a womb like image that highlights the purity of childhood versus the ugliness of war
rocchelli was also by now a young father with an unordinary and somewhat risky profession
when news of his death arrived in italy some described him as a herald for a new era in journalism
the self assigned freelance journalists now roaming the world in dangerous zones driven by idealism
to people who knew him well there was more to rocchelli than meets the eye
he valued independence in journalism and that is what we at cesura want to maintain arcara said
you can be a photographer to win prizes or sell pictures and move on

but when you focus on what you really want to do what you believe in you can grow
andy rocchelli was an italian photojournalist who co founded the cesura collective
he was killed while covering the conflict in ukraine on may twenty four

colombian rebels released a top military general and two other hostages sunday in a move that could allow stalled peace talks to resume
brig
gen. rubn daro alzate who commands a two thousand five hundred soldier counterinsurgency group and previously headed the colombian army's anti kidnapping unit was among the hostages handed over to mediators in a rural area in western colombia the international committee of the red cross said
the released hostages are in perfect condition colombian president juan manuel santos said in a twitter post sunday
colombia's defense ministry said they were being transported to the country's capital sunday evening to reunite with their families and undergo medical checkups after fourteen days in captivity
local media reported that alzate was the highest ranking officer to be taken prisoner by guerrillas from the revolutionary armed forces of colombia during the country's bloody five decades old civil war
the high profile capture two weeks ago sent the peace talks in havana between the government and the rebels who are known as the farc screeching to a halt
colombian president juan manuel santos suspended the peace talks demanded alzate's release and called on the country's military to investigate why the general had apparently broken protocol by venturing into rebel territory
alzate was traveling by a boat along a river in an area known to be a hub for drug smugglers and rebels when he an army lawyer and a corporal were captured colombian government officials said
a second soldier traveling with the group managed to escape and told officials that alzate and his companions had been in the area to inspect an energy project
but farc leaders told reporters in havana earlier this month that no such project exists in that area and that they were baffled by alzate's presence there
rebels released alzate the corporal and the army lawyer sunday to representatives of the cuban and norwegian governments and the red cross
they were transported via helicopter to medellin where they were handed over to the colombian army the red cross said
on twitter colombia's defense ministry posted a photo of the three freed hostages meeting with the defense minister and other military leaders
the u.s. government has provided colombia's military with billions of dollars in training and aid to battle farc guerrillas who authorities accuse of massive scale drug trafficking to finance their insurgency
at the beginning of the peace talks in two thousand and twelve farc leaders said they had released all their prisoners and hostages as a sign of good faith
but president santos has resisted their offers of a ceasefire saying a previous armistice allowed rebels to seize large swathes of territory
santos said in a statement that he would be meeting with his government's negotiators to discuss the terms of their return to havana
the release of the hostages sunday he said contributed to restoring a climate conducive to continuing the talks demonstrates the maturity of the process and permits us to unite our voice to those of millions of colombians who express their solidarity with those freed
the rebels renewed their calls for a ceasefire in a written statement released sunday saying the guerrilla group must now redesign the rules of the game
it is time for a bilateral ceasefire an armistice so that no bellicose event on the battlefield can be used to justify the interruption of such beautiful and historic work as it is to agree on peace for a nation that longs for this destiny the farc said
after the hostages release a red cross official said he hoped the peace talks would start up again
we hope that the peace talks between the colombian government and the farc ep will resume soon christoph harnisch who heads the red cross delegation in colombia said in a statement
we continue to support this process with a view to alleviating the suffering of all the victims of this long conflict
cnn's edwin mesa and nelson quiones contributed to this report

time has effectively stood still in the ukrainian city of pripyat which was evacuated in the aftermath of the one thousand nine hundred and eighty six chernobyl nuclear explosion
at the time of the disaster during the soviet era about forty nine thousand people lived in pripyat located less than two miles from the chernobyl nuclear power plant
they left behind schools homes factories parks and gyms that have remained largely undisturbed for the past thirty years
armed with a camera and a dosimeter geiger counter cinematographer danny cooke explored the remains of pripyat and chernobyl
he pieced the footage together in a three minute video that boasts drone footage of sweeping shots of abandoned buildings and parks
he also photographed building interiors on foot capturing haunting scenes of empty schools and homes
cooke visited pripyat and chernobyl in june while working for cbs news on a sixty minutes episode
he created the video to showcase his camerawork from the shoot for his portfolio
it was his first time there though he has memories of chernobyl's effect on his family living in italy at the time
the nuclear dust clouds swept westward towards us
the italian police went round and threw away all the local produce and my mother rushed out to purchase as much tinned milk as possible to feed me her infant son he said
it caused so much distress hundreds of miles away so i can't imagine how terrifying it would have been for the hundreds of thousands of ukrainian citizens who were forced to evacuate
the visit was a life changing experience he said
it's very hard to explain however i feel different from when i set foot into the zone to when i left
my perspective of life changed slightly he said in an email to cnn
on approaching the zone i was aware that radiation is an invisible sensation but regardless my body reacted in a psychological way
my brain was telling me that perhaps i'd made the wrong choice and this wasn't such a good idea he said
it was too late to go back now but i'll never regret ever entering the zone
the sight of the school canteen floor in pripyat will be something i will never forget in my lifetime
what the evacuees must have gone through is unthinkable

the country's electoral court announced that tabar vazquez of the left wing broad front coalition won the presidential runoff with about fifty three percents of the votes
candidate luis lacalle pou of the conservative national party told supporters sunday evening that he had conceded to vazquez and wished him well as exit polls predicted defeat
he garnered about forty percents of the vote
vazquez's victory gives uruguay a third consecutive five year term with a leftist leader at the helm
president jose pepe mujica a former marxist guerrilla who donates the majority of his salary drives a one thousand nine hundred and eighty seven volkswagen beetle and sells flowers with his wife at their home leaves office next year
vazquez a seventy four year old oncologist was uruguay's president from two thousand and five to two thousand and ten
uruguayans again have said yes yes to more freedoms and more rights better democracy and better citizenship he said in a televised speech sunday
under mujica's leadership the broad front has pushed through reforms legalizing abortion same sex marriage and marijuana major policy shifts in a region once defined by conservative policies influenced by the roman catholic church
the changes have given uruguay formerly a military dictatorship a reputation in latin america as a leading nation for liberal social policies
and that approach isn't likely to change if vazquez's uruguay doesn't stop campaign slogan is any indication
this year the south american nation became the first in the world to have a system regulating the legal production sale and consumption of marijuana
lacalle had vowed to repeal some parts of the new law if he were elected
vazquez a doctor who crusaded against tobacco during his first term as president has expressed some concerns about the new marijuana law but said he plans to enforce it
still uruguay's el pais newspaper recently reported that he hasn't ruled out the possibility of modifying it
there will be a strict and very close evaluation about the impact that this law has on society
we are going to analyze it very carefully
and if at any moment we see that it does not work we will not hesitate for a moment in making the necessary corrections he said according to el pais

an appeals judge in qatar on sunday cleared american couple matthew and grace huang of starving their adopted daughter to death in two thousand and thirteen in a case that drew global attention to the middle eastern nation's justice system
however the couple were blocked from leaving qatar on sunday by immigration officials at hamad international airport who confiscated their passports according to the doha news agency which cited a family spokesman eric volz
a new warrant had been issued for their arrest on unknown charges the agency cited volz as saying
the couple remained at the airport sunday night with the u.s
ambassador to qatar dana shell smith doha news reported
earlier matthew huang issued a statement thanking the qatari judge for his decision
this has been an emotional trial for me and my family matthew huang said in a statement
grace and i want to go home and be reunited with our sons
we have not been able to grieve our daughter's death but we want to thank the judge for today's decision
the huangs who were living in qatar while matthew huang worked for a international company working on construction projects for the two thousand and twenty two world cup were arrested in january two thousand and thirteen when their eight year old daughter gloria died
they were charged with starving her to death convicted in march and sentenced to three years in prison
the qatari prosecutor sought to paint grace and matthew huang as inhumane alleging they bought their adopted daughter cheaply from her poverty stricken parents in africa and had threatened to seek human trafficking charges
the couple spent nearly a year in prison before being freed in november two thousand and thirteen pending their appeal
in explaining his decision to overturn the conviction judge abdulrahman al sharafi cited weaknesses in forensic reports and said the trial judge failed to properly consider testimony from witnesses who said gloria wasn't deprived
a report by pathologists hired by the defense obtained by cnn stated they found no evidence tissue samples were taken from gloria's body after her death despite the fact qatari investigators submitted an autopsy report
advocates for the huangs suggested the lab report was fabricated and said their request with the qatari judiciary for a formal investigation went unanswered
the case against the huangs shined a light on the qatari justice system and drew complaints from the united states
qatar is a key ally in the u.s. led coalition against the terror group isis and host to many countries forces involved in airstrikes
the qatari government also helped the united states secure the release of sgt
bowe bergdahl from taliban captivity this year
despite the close ties the state department expressed concern
officials requested in october that qatar's government lift the huangs travel ban allowing them to return to the united states
the twenty two long months of court proceedings following their daughter's tragic death have compounded the tragedy for the huang family and it is time now as the appeals court stated to let the huangs return home u.s. secretary of state john kerry said in a statement
we are deeply concerned about new delays that have prevented their departure he said
a united nations special rapporteur investigating the justice system in qatar also called attention to the huangs case and urged the government to release them and send them home
after the couple's arrest their two sons also adopted from africa were temporarily placed in a qatari orphanage
they have since been sent back to the united states to live with grace huang's mother
the entire family chipped in during the prolonged separation
with matthew huang fired from his job the couple are living on donations from family and friends
grace huang's brother daniel chin gave up his job in california to work on the case full time
he was the nerve center of the family raising money for expenses and defense costs and dealing with the huangs lawyers and advocates
their focus on their fate took away from time for them to grieve gloria's loss
everything has revolved around her case and our situation grace huang said
we haven't had a chance to really say goodbye and mourn
we just really want to be able to honor her place in our lives with our friends and family and that hasn't happened yet
