and as i don't think that language deemed by some as foul should be banned while playing games i don't think that it should be banned in uploaded videos of games being played
many online were echoing <unk> initial point
how can a company crack down on profanity while at the same time promoting video games filled with the stuff
xbox live is suspending accounts for language
they don't want kids hearing four letter words as they go on a virtual killing spree said mike <unk> on twitter
if xbox is gon na ban twelve <unk> olds for abusive language they just eliminated their entire fan base added twitter user <unk> morgan
in dead rising three an exclusive title for the xbox one the words f k <unk> t and a <unk> can be heard in the dialogue according to the game's m for mature rating from the entertainment software rating board
players are also able to visit a <unk> supply shop and buy an adult toy that can be turned into the super <unk> a weapon that can be used on zombies
microsoft said players who run <unk> of its rules are being temporarily suspended from using certain apps not banned from xbox live indefinitely
apple has bought a three d sensor company that helped build microsoft's motion control system kinect stirring curiosity about what the tech giant might be up to behind closed doors in cupertino
<unk> is an israel based company that specializes in sensors that let users interact with mobile devices like tablets and smartphones by waving their hands
the company's technology was used to help create kinect rolled out for the xbox three hundred and sixty in two thousand and ten as a way for gamers to put down the controller and use their bodies and voices to play games
it's been incorporated further into the new xbox one console letting users control movies and other media with their voices
apple had reportedly been in talks with <unk> since july
the deal was sealed for a reported three hundred and sixty million dollar
a statement released by apple in response to queries resulted in the same non confirmation confirmation it has released after past acquisitions
apple buys smaller technology companies from time to time and we generally do not discuss our purpose or plans the statement says
<unk> has confirmed the purchase but offered no further details
the purchase of course immediately spurred speculation about what apple might have in mind
apple could be thinking a number of things from gaming on ipads to a way to interact with apple tv or the rumored tv set said carolina milanesi a tech analyst with <unk> research
she said she doubts apple is working on a dedicated gaming device
instead she speculated the company could be looking at a way to connect multiple devices and operate them at the same time
gesture certainly has a place in <unk> touch and voice as a way to interact with different devices she said
gesture could be particularly useful in interacting with different screens in the home
the less exciting possibility is that we'll never see a product or feature as a direct result of the buyout
apple has done a series of acquisitions that we have not seen through as far as a practical implementation of the technology milanesi said
but as the news spread monday it was the possibility of the long rumored apple tv set that many were thinking about
apple centric blog nine to five mac reported in september that apple was testing motion sensor technology for television products
to some the <unk> purchase signals that apple is working on something truly different
the television has supposedly been in the works for years and the company is widely expected to be rolling out a smartwatch in the not too distant future
but incremental upgrades to its popular iphone and ipad lines in recent years have led some observers to say the company has lost its <unk> for groundbreaking innovation
that's a concept milanesi rejects
to think that apple is not innovating just because we do not see a new category of product hitting the market is quite <unk> she said
<unk> gonzalez had been waiting for an xbox one since one p.m. thursday
brian miller in his own way had been waiting since june
both walked away from a best buy in <unk> maryland early friday with one of the newly released next generation gaming consoles from microsoft
the box hit shelves a week after rival sony's playstation four marking the official start of the latest battle in <unk> console wars
miller forty who pre ordered the xbox one in june said he loves everything microsoft does
the sparks maryland resident prepared by playing his xbox three hundred and sixty into the ground with his eight year old daughter <unk>
we play co op all the time whenever there is a chance he said
i'm picking up <unk> for myself
i'm getting just dance for her
i can't wait to try out the new entertainment set up for it
<unk> waited outside the store with his dad jose
the thirteen year old missed out on pre ordering but didn't want to lose his chance for an xbox one after making good grades in school and earning the right to get the console
i've only played xbox three hundred and sixty and didn't have the kinect <unk> said
this will be my first time and i'm really looking forward to using it
xbox one on
the xbox one which sells for four hundred and ninety nine dollar continues microsoft's move toward making the console not just a gaming device but a central entertainment hub too
with the kinect voice and motion controller users can call out favorite television shows or movies split the tv screen between two different applications or even record and share their gameplay with friends
marc <unk> corporate vice president of xbox live said it's only the beginning of how microsoft thinks people will use their consoles as home entertainment centers
one of the things that has been just so amazing for the xbox one is the passion of the fans about play and xbox live <unk> told cnn in a pre midnight interview
everything we do is really about how we build new experiences for them
it's awesome
<unk> said kinect originally promoted as a tool for hands free gaming is increasingly becoming a focal point for the entire xbox system
jason <unk> of <unk> maryland said the device is the biggest draw for him
it is more than just gaming
it is the multimedia experience he said
i'm looking forward to just calling out my movie or pulling up netflix with my voice
it is a giant universal remote control
<unk> also pre ordered his console this summer
he and his friends treated the midnight launch like opening night of a sports season or hollywood blockbuster
we've been talking with each other texting each other since we ordered
it really made the wait harder <unk> said
today was the longest day ever
crowds <unk> those for last week's playstation four rollout lined up for the xbox launch in thirteen countries
in new york's times square a concert featuring hip hop artist <unk> was part of the launch event
early controversies including concerns about the ability to <unk> and share games on the system didn't appear to have hurt the turnout
but miller said he was a bit <unk> about the lack of a selection of games for launch and <unk> agreed
the day one lineup of games is not fantastic <unk> said
i'm confident though
they haven't reached their peak and better games are out there waiting to be made
xbox has always listened to what i wanted
that's why i'm getting the xbox one
commercial air travel is already filled with <unk> like shrinking personal space <unk> meals and frequent delays
for many people there's one bright spot to flying
a forced break from making receiving and hearing phone calls
that could change with the federal communication commissions new proposal to drop the ban on cellular connections and allow phone calls once a plane reaches ten thousand feet
the fcc first pitched the idea in two thousand and four before the rise of the smartphone
the reaction from passengers and flight attendant unions at the time was loud and negative
phone calls on planes would be disruptive annoying and a potential safety issue
the fcc decided against the proposal
now people are more attached to their tablets and smartphones
so much so that they <unk> against the ban on using small electronic devices such as phones tablets and e readers during takeoff and landing
after reviewing safety issues the faa and airlines finally gave in this month and relaxed restrictions
quietly playing games or reading e books on a tablet or phone is one thing but chatting away mid flight doesn't seem to be as in demand
in a survey of one thousand six hundred adults by an advisory group the faa found that sixty one percents of people supported a ban on making calls while in the air
i'm definitely against it said <unk> hilton travel editor at the san francisco chronicle
people would be carrying on loud full voiced conversations right next to someone who doesn't want to hear it
the association of flight attendants the world's largest union of flight attendants came out against the idea on thursday citing safety and security concerns
in far too many operational scenarios passengers making phone calls could extend beyond a mere <unk> creating negative effects on aviation safety and security that are great and far too risky the <unk> said in a statement
brett snyder who blogs about the airline industry on <unk> dot com agrees with lifting the restriction and thinks each airline should be allowed to set its own policy
the public in the u.s. seems to be strongly against cell phones on airplanes but let the airlines make the decision on whether or not they want to move forward and allow it said snyder
cell phones could cause friction between passengers who want to talk and passengers who would prefer peace and quiet
they would introduce yet another behavior flight attendants would have to police
we're trained to de escalate
why would you put something in the environment that can escalate
said <unk> shook the international president of the association of flight attendants
shook has worked as a flight attendant for the past twenty two years
the idea potentially introduces yet another stress factor into an already stressful environment said airline pilot patrick smith of <unk> dot com
the stress is made worse by tight quarters
when taking a phone call in public it's good etiquette to keep ten feet away from other people protocol expert pamela <unk> told reuters
it's not even possible to get ten inches of space on an airplane where economy class seats are typically seventeen to eighteen inches wide and each seat is <unk> up against the one next to it
one option is for the fcc and airlines to allow cell phone use and hope that passengers act responsibly and only make calls when necessary and speak in a quiet voice
unfortunately the firsthand experience of flight attendants frequently fliers and people who take other forms of mass transit cast doubt on that dream scenario
the real problem with travel especially air travel is not baggage fees it's not long lines
the real problem with travel is other travelers said hilton
this is not the first time the issue has come up
terrestrial mass transit systems including <unk> buses and trains have already struggled with the invasion of cell phones and loud <unk>
some trains have addressed the problem of disruptive passengers on cellphones by adding quiet cars during certain hours
the metro north railroad has separate cars during rush hour where noise loud chatting and phone calls are prohibited
some amtrak trains also offer quiet cars which forbid phone calls and any noise technology and feature <unk> <unk> lighting
<unk> bus lines doesn't have an official policy but individual bus drivers have been known to crack down on loud <unk>
unfortunately quiet sections aren't a practical solution for airplanes
on an airplane there's no such thing as a quiet car said shook
in my opinion it's not that different from having a smoking section on a seven hundred and forty seven it's absurd
smoking sections which separated smokers and nonsmokers with a row of seats were banned in the united states along with smoking on airplanes in one thousand nine hundred and eighty eight
before one thousand nine hundred and seventy three smokers could light up in any seat they liked
theoretically you could have a talking section and a <unk> section but you'd have to put up some serious <unk> said hilton
discount malaysian airline airasia introduced a quiet zone in early two thousand and thirteen
<unk> between first class and economy the zone is an adult only section intended to give travelers a <unk> from <unk> children
like smoke from cigarettes and the sound of a crying baby a loud phone conversation would likely ignore any invisible barriers and carry through an entire plane
the fcc will present its proposal in december but even if it passes it will be a while before in flight cell phone calls are a reality
cell phone towers are on the ground and airplanes will need special equipment before passengers can dial out
as it stands cellular phones simply will not work at higher <unk> in an airplane cabin
changing this will require investment in on board technology said smith
individual airlines will have to decide if allowing calls is something they want to allow
a more business oriented airline might jump at the opportunity to lure working travelers
others might side with the majority of passengers and flight attendants and stick with a policy of silence is golden
there's so much <unk> and <unk> out there already said shook
can people just have some peace and quiet for a few hours
it's not that retro of an idea
according to popular wisdom attempting to reinvent the wheel is the ultimate in design <unk>
but this didn't stop object designer duncan <unk> from giving it a go
when he sat down at his desk to begin work on the morph wheel <unk> took on the design challenge and the results might just turn out to be revolutionary
in both senses of the word
the morph is a <unk> wheelchair wheel that can <unk> to around half of its original width
it is designed to provide greater flexibility and mobility to the estimated sixty five million people around the world who need a wheelchair
the folding wheel was originally created as a folding bicycle wheel by <unk> when he was a graduate student at the royal college of arts in london
but calls from the wheelchair community suggested to him that the design would possibly be more useful to wheelchair users
read
the <unk> <unk> and nine other great folding vehicles
when people say is this <unk> the wheel
that's a phrase that everyone knows <unk> says but it's really <unk> the wheel to make it just a little bit better
that's really what you're trying to do when you're designing any product
the main advantage of the morph the designer says is that it can fit into small spaces allowing wheelchair users greater flexibility when traveling by car train or airplane
this project started out by looking at the problems caused by large wheels if you're looking at folding bicycles or the space needed for a folding wheelchair says <unk>
having a small wheel or a large wheel dictates the entire design of the wheelchair and what you can do with it
if you can fold a big wheel up into a smaller space then suddenly for the first time you can get the best of both worlds
you can have a wheelchair that has all the advantages of having a large wheel but can also be stored into a much smaller space
david <unk> co founder of motivation a charity that aims to help people with mobility <unk> says that in his view the morph wheel could be useful in both developed countries and the developing world
i can see all kinds of uses for this says <unk> certainly in the context of the us and more developed countries
car boots airplane lockers any sort of small space you might want to pack a small chair into
not everybody uses a chair every day so if it has got quick release wheels and you fold the chair up and you fold these down flat storage is easy for people who don't use a wheelchair all the time
in the context i work in developing countries if it's low cost enough people often live in one room with the whole families so they often want a folding wheelchair just to keep it out of the way when they're either in bed or sat on the floor cooking and so again something that packs down as small as this would be extremely useful
the morph wheel has received awards around the world including the transport category at the london design museum design of the year awards two thousand and thirteen and the two thousand and thirteen popular science best of what's new award in the health category
morph wheels are available online from <unk>

a self professed apple fanatic jonathan <unk> was looking for a book of photography profiling the company's products through the years
when he didn't find one the atlanta software engineer decided to make one himself
iconic
a photographic tribute to apple innovation is the result
released last month the <unk> coffee table book contains three hundred and fifty pages of photos documenting nearly every product the company has ever made
apple has long been <unk> focused on design and <unk> a native of melbourne australia said he wanted to celebrate that with his images
other companies came up with the guts for a machine and then the engineers would find a way to stuff them into a box said <unk>
steve jobs started with the box and said you need to find a way to get the guts in
the book currently available only through its website sells for seventy five dollar or three hundred dollar for a special edition which along with other <unk> comes with a custom fit book case designed in a retro style inspired by apple products of the one thousand nine hundred and seventies and eighties
it's all an unlikely project for a software engineer with no formal photography training
<unk> bought new equipment and consulted with a professional as he began the project which was four years in the making
all along he focused on shooting artistic images that didn't resemble promotional product shots
i didn't want to take photos that you could find in marketing material he said
instead he said he approached each shot by looking for an image that would create that same emotional connection to that product but maybe doesn't look like something you've seen before
for example when shooting the first version of the iphone released in two thousand and seven he chose an image of the back of the phone
i don't really remember seeing a lot of the photos of the back he said
it's little things like that
<unk> who began sharing his images on the website <unk> of apple said he hasn't had any official communications with apple about the book
i didn't even try to reach out
i knew that it probably wouldn't get anywhere he said
i can tell you there's been an enormous outpouring of support and enthusiasm from employees
people at the company are buying the book they're buying it for themselves they're buying it for their friends
that feedback is obviously very <unk>
no less of an authority than apple co founder steve <unk> wrote a <unk> to the book
within these pages jonathan presents a thoughtful and artistic gift to apple fans and employees alike
photographs of apple products from hardware to packaging the likes of which i've never seen compiled before he writes
jonathan's passion for this project is reflected on every page and each honors the hard work of every employee and collaborator that has passed through apple's doors
sprint tumbled to last place in this year's consumer reports rankings for u.s. wireless service providers based on a survey of users
although it trailed only first place verizon in overall customer satisfaction among major carriers sprint got what consumer reports called dismal marks for value voice text and four g reliability
our latest cell service satisfaction survey revealed a somewhat <unk> decline by sprint that <unk> the rankings of the major standard service providers said glenn <unk> electronics content development team leader for consumer reports
and smaller no <unk> no contract and <unk> service providers continue to do a better job of satisfying customers and provide an increasingly viable alternative to some of the expensive long term contracts that many consumers find themselves locked into
the rankings released thursday were based on a survey of fifty eight thousand three hundred and ninety nine wireless subscribers
sprint said the slip likely is due to improvements the company is making to its network
we've asked customers during the past year to pardon our dust as we build out and upgrade our network sprint said in a statement
we're working to deliver an advanced wireless network that we believe over time will deliver <unk> speed and performance to our customers
the statement said that in markets where the work is complete the company is seeing higher customer satisfaction
it noted an american customer satisfaction index report this year that ranked sprint as the most improved company across forty seven industries during the past five years
the findings in the consumer reports survey indicate we still have work to do and only serve to make us even more committed to providing outstanding wireless service to our customers the statement said
small providers scored well with consumer reports beating out the nation's major players
consumer cellular was the overall leader gaining high scores across the board even though as consumer reports pointed out it uses the same network as atandt which ranked lower
many small carriers offer no contract and <unk> plans that some consumers prefer
atandt which along with t mobile finished in the middle of the field among major carriers was the only company to receive the highest ranking for the reliability of its four g service
according to the consumer reports survey thirty eight percents of respondents who had data plans that set limits on usage used only half or less of their monthly <unk>
that the group said may mean many customers paid for wireless service they didn't need
more detailed survey results are expected to be posted thursday on the consumer reports website
for victims of smartphone theft the ultimate justice is hitting a button that <unk> the device turning it into a <unk> <unk> <unk>
more importantly the ability to disable a stolen smartphone could reduce theft for all consumers since the <unk> value of the devices would <unk>
called a kill switch this type of feature already exists and could be included on smartphones
it would be triggered by the phone's owner with his or her user name and password if the device goes missing or is stolen
major u.s. wireless carriers though have pushed back against the idea of a kill switch
they claim that the feature could be exploited by hackers and that once triggered it would be difficult to undo
proponents argue that the process is completely <unk> and that the real reason carriers don't want the feature is that they would lose money on insurance plans <unk> of <unk> phones and sales of replacement phones
i think that this is motivated by profit said san francisco district attorney george <unk>
along with new york attorney general eric <unk> <unk> heads up the secure our smartphones initiative a coalition of law enforcement officials and other parties from across the u.s
the group is pushing smartphone makers and the wireless industry to take more actions to protect consumers from smartphone theft
smartphone theft has been on the rise across the united states in recent years and in many cases it can turn violent
in san francisco sixty seven percents of <unk> are related to mobile devices according to the police department
ten percent of phone owners have had a phone stolen according to a harris poll and in two thousand and twelve one point six million americans were victims of smartphone theft according to consumer reports
the secure our smartphones initiative has been working with samsung to get a kill switch included on the south korean company's <unk> an effort that recently hit a major obstacle
we have seen e mails that indicate that the carriers refuse to allow samsung to put a third party solution in their phones said <unk> referring to e mails between samsung and a developer
theft in its own way is a <unk> for wireless carriers
for example for seven dollar a month smartphone owners can get an insurance plan with their device purchased through atandt that will cover theft as well as loss and accidental damage
<unk> phones are profitable to carriers when they're <unk> by new owners and consumers who don't have insurance will often pay full price for a new device through the carriers
we are working with the leaders of the secure our smartphones initiative to incorporate the perspective of law enforcement agencies
we will continue to work with them and our wireless carrier partners towards our common goal of stopping smartphone theft said samsung in a statement
the major u.s. carriers declined to comment for this story standing behind a statement from ctia the wireless association an industry group that represents wireless companies
ctia and its member companies worked hard over the last year to help law enforcement with its stolen phone problem said ctia vice president jamie hastings in a statement
the industry with direction from the federal communications commission law enforcement officials from major cities and other policymakers worked <unk> to develop a proactive <unk> approach to dry up the <unk> for stolen phones
the organization outlined the anti theft actions it does support
one of its primary alternatives to a kill <unk> is a global database of smartphones that would make it harder for a stolen device to be <unk>
but unless all the carriers around the world participate thieves can continue to ship stolen devices to other countries and sell them there
the ctia is also pushing the use of remote tracking and wiping apps educating owners on preventing theft and asking for stronger legal penalties for smartphone thieves
one company is powerful enough to add the feature without carrier approval
apple
the company successfully introduced a kill switch like option called activation lock to iphones and ipads with the release of its latest mobile operating system ios seven
apple has been able to show the industry that this can be done said <unk>
unlike makers of android phones apple controls all aspects of its devices including the hardware to the operating system
because iphones are so popular and profitable for carriers apple has been able to dictate what features are included on its devices
apple is also leading the way on theft prevention because its devices are the most popular target for smartphone thieves
manufacturers like samsung are navigating a more complicated system
the added kill switch feature would be added by samsung to the google android operating system already on the device
they need to sell those altered devices to carriers which have the power to say no
while law enforcement in the u.s. <unk> the next steps in the battle against smartphone theft it can look outside the u.s. for inspiration
south korea recently introduced an act that would require all domestic smartphone manufactures including lg and samsung to include a kill switch feature on devices sold in the country
i'd say about ninety five percents of the time amazon suggests a book to me it's one i already have he says
this is not due to a lack of interest on the part of <unk> a professor at case western university who specializes in the history and philosophy of science
he'd still like some interesting perhaps off the wall suggestions
but amazon's <unk> algorithm embodied in the recommendations page of your amazon dot com and the customers who bought this item also bought line on each product page doesn't cast a net wide enough for <unk> consideration
in that he sees a bigger concern
our reliance on computer algorithms he observes may be narrowing our choices
they're taking <unk> the random happy accidents of life out of the mix
we're losing something vital to the production of knowledge he says
it's kind of surprising actually
the internet is a gigantic ball of randomness an entire universe of human understanding whether it's wikipedia entries scholarly articles youtube videos social media memes or everything in between
when we talk about surfing the internet we're often describing a session of jumping from site to site and link to link with little connection besides our own curiosity
jorge luis <unk> would be thrilled
on the other hand in trying to reduce that knowledge to bite sized <unk> we risk lowering the possibility of <unk>
digital tools come equipped with sophisticated algorithms catering to our personalities our <unk> our expectations and we don't necessarily seek out something new and different
enter a musical starting point into pandora for instance and you get songs or artists similar to the one you began with
a search term in google may produce dozens of results but we seldom click past the first page which has the most popular suggestions
siri is helpful even entertaining but not particularly surprising
this is all well and good but is something missing
one of the really unfortunate effects is that people are not forced to think about things that they wouldn't normally think about with everything designed exactly the way you would ideally like it to be he says
it really kind of puts the brain to sleep
the issue gets back to the old divide between <unk> and novelty
on the one hand we like comfort zones and convenience
we stick with certain products and especially in the internet age want our choices quickly and efficiently
long before computers ruled we set up systems to provide the expected
consider top forty radio born out of an observation that people like to hear the same songs over and over and fast food chains known for their strict quality controls
today the wealth of data provided by the internet can make those choices even easier
businesses media organizations and advertisers love big data which lets them target consumers more accurately
jacqueline <unk> the founder and ceo of <unk> a marketing company that creates targeted television advertising believes the internet age has made for more engaging personalized content
people don't want to be talked at and advertised to but what they do respond to is relevant communication that is not <unk> advertising she says
yes the sharing of data raises privacy issues but what you're finding is that people want a personalized experience
if i'm going to be advertised to at least it's stuff i'm actually interested in and i want to know about
however there are times when the unexpected pays huge dividends whether it's taking a chance on a new dish reading a new author or simply getting lost
this divide is something artificial intelligence experts have considered for years says tim <unk> the ceo and founder of expect labs a san francisco based firm specializing in <unk> technology
we're continuing to move toward a world where we can surround ourselves with only the information we care about he observes and the systems that we use will learn what we like and feed it to us twenty four hours a day
there's no escaping that he continues and we'll have to adjust
indeed expect labs cornerstone product due out soon is called <unk> a voice recognition ipad app that monitors conversations to streamline information discovery its website says
but <unk> adds we're not in that world yet and he suspects that inventors will continue to refine systems to add the unexpected
ten years from now fifteen years from now we might look back and we'll realize that there's a downside of only giving people just the information they care about and i suspect we'll learn to make these systems so they can surprise you every now and then the mit and bell labs veteran says
but the field isn't there yet
in the meantime tech thinkers have raised the alarm of living in our own <unk>
eli <unk> in his book the filter bubble worried that the internet was <unk> us by interests
the algorithms that <unk> our ads are starting to <unk> our lives he says in a ted talk
in addition <unk> points out common online results can turn into <unk>
i would say that the biggest problem with this stuff is not the loss of <unk> but the accelerated rate of <unk> of beliefs he says
for example google has made out of copyright books available free online
in one study he says more than seventy percents of a large class cited the same secondary source from the early twenty th century and nothing contemporary
that's because says <unk> they could download this secondary source from google books and didn't have to go to the library to get secondary source material
similarly in another much debated study analysts tested a hypothesis that electronically posted work would broaden science
instead the study showed exactly the opposite <unk> says more <unk>
he compares it to a google feedback loop
the more times something was viewed on google the more likely it was to pop up in a search and the more it popped up in a search the more likely it was to be viewed
so you have this feedback loop that results in a rapid destruction of alternative views he says
another turn of the wheel
the fact is though that the internet has also allowed for the kind of broad communication that's never existed before
hand <unk> about technology producing a loss of randomness is really an immersion in nostalgia says robert weiss the author of the forthcoming closer together further apart
the effect of technology and the internet on sex intimacy and relationships
it's just another turn of the wheel says weiss a social worker and executive at elements behavioral health
he points out that a previous generation worried that television was going to ruin the family by pulling people away from the dinner table to watch the tube in silence
years later in an age of being attached to individual screens the tv age was <unk> to suggest family <unk>
so the internet is narrowing choice and closing doors
far from it says weiss
it's actually opening them which opens up more opportunities for those willing to walk through he says
what technology has done is replace something we have taken away in the twenty th century community he says
the <unk> era saw the breakdown of extended families and tight knit neighborhoods but thanks to the internet and the devices that use it we have created this ability to connect with people and create community
we can find large groups of people who share interests and we don't have to take time to go searching for something that we might not even find
moreover many sites and apps allow us to make sense of randomness in a way we couldn't before he adds
take shazam the popular music identification app
in the pre smartphone age you could hear a random song and never know what it was it was there and gone
now one click of shazam and you can not only find out what it is but also make it yours
we're still getting used to these new paths weiss says
the older generation always younger people's new technologies because we're afraid of being left behind he says
things haven't really changed that much weiss adds
for example he says a previous generation listened to the radio by spinning a dial to find stations with favorites marked by buttons
the process is different now digitally scanned <unk> internet services bluetooth apps but we still listen to the radio
but doug cannon a philosophy professor at the university of <unk> sound sees the radio <unk> differently
that dial <unk> allowed us to find things we may have overlooked
similarly we now have access to countless headlines on news sites but because of their structure people generally stick with a handful those above the fold unlike reading a newspaper where the large medium encourages readers to scan an <unk> and turn pages for more
tuning out the unexpected is like being <unk> guided by a gps he says
you lose the sense of where you are
to have substitute for our sensory capacities and for our memories and for our having the opportunity for random encounters and unexpected <unk> seems to me to be a real loss he says
of course as expect labs <unk> points out we're not there yet
and smart researchers recognize that even at our most predictable we're not entirely predictable
all the investments we make to try to almost engineer <unk> don't really work because of a thing the academics call causal <unk>
even the most well done social science research can't explain how and why some outcomes occur in some situations says rita mcgrath a professor at columbia university's business school
so even our most <unk> attempts to game the system for the outcomes we want often miss the mark
it helps to remember that the internet and related technology even with all their capabilities remain tools says <unk>
as with automation throughout the centuries the idea is to free our bodies and our minds to focus on other things
if you can <unk> mundane tasks that gives people the time to really be creative and to work on the interesting things they don't have time to do he says
the key says weiss is simply being open to the randomness that does present itself
we still walk in the world he says
if there's a problem we're the problem
on november nineteen one thousand eight hundred and sixty three president abraham lincoln <unk> a civil war battlefield in gettysburg pennsylvania by vowing that government of the people by the people for the people shall not <unk> from the earth
one hundred and fifty years later document experts are going to great lengths to make sure that copies of his famous speech handwritten by lincoln himself hold up as well as the words themselves
five original versions of <unk> gettysburg address remain and they are still used for research and study
but warm temperatures light humidity and even oxygen are enemies of old paper manuscripts
there's nothing that compares to the original said michele <unk> a paper and photograph <unk> at cornell university which has one of the five copies of the speech
we need to find a balance between having these national treasures and wanting to make them widely available
to make both possible researchers have developed advanced preservation and replication techniques that include environmental sensors high quality scanners and specially built cases
each of the five versions of the gettysburg address <unk> are slightly different
called the <unk> copy <unk> version has been through a lot
it was written out by lincoln months after he gave his original speech and given to historian george <unk>
it stayed in the <unk> family for years before bouncing around between dealers and eventually ending up at cornell
for a time it had a <unk> cover
but the dealer who made the cover didn't realize that <unk> was actually damaging the prized document
<unk> is very unstable and within ten to fifteen years the front of the document had experienced severe <unk>
luckily other factors have helped the <unk> survive
we're really fortunate that president lincoln used a great quality writing paper and his <unk> of ink was good said <unk>
to keep the paper from deteriorating any further cornell carefully controlling its environment and limits its exposure to light
since the university's copy is written on both sides of a single sheet of paper they had to develop a special case that would allow people to view the whole text
cornell created a custom case made out of uv ray filtering <unk>
most of the time the document is kept in a secure storage <unk> that's been specially designed for rare materials
there's almost no light in the <unk> and it has a steady temperature of sixty five degrees fahrenheit and forty percents relative humidity
sensors constantly monitor the <unk> to keep the humidity and temperature steady
to mark the one hundred and fifty th anniversary of <unk> speech cornell is putting the original on display as part of a special exhibit
but even when shown to the public the document is kept in low light just enough for visitors to read <unk> neat <unk> handwriting without doing additional damage to the paper
lesson from lincoln
mr. president you're talking too much
advanced imaging technology also has made it possible for libraries to make extremely high resolution digital copies of historical documents
the cornell scan is so good that they've printed out a near replica of their gettysburg address to occasionally keep on display in place of the original
a digital copy means that people who wouldn't normally be able to make it to cornell or the library of congress to see the <unk> in person can examine them up close online from anywhere
researchers around the globe can do work from the digital scans without worrying about damaging a priceless artifact
google has copies of all five <unk> online for anyone to view and compare as part of its cultural institute
the preservation technology is even more elaborate at the library of congress
to protect their two copies of the gettysburg address <unk> there fabricated custom cases with <unk> that purge all of the oxygen around the document and replace it with <unk> <unk> gas
when you take away the oxygen you take away the potential of <unk> which can erode the delicate original material
the <unk> <unk> are also used for many of the older documents <unk> the founding of the united states which are written on delicate <unk> paper
it's likely that as students continue to study four score and seven years ago the technology used to preserve <unk> original documents will become even more advanced
at this point there's a good chance you've seen pictures of apple's proposed new headquarters a two point eight million square foot spaceship parked in a <unk> man made forest in the northeast corner of cupertino
since the first dozen or so renderings <unk> out in two thousand and eleven however we haven't gotten a much better sense of what all the new campus will entail or what it will be like to work there
until now
apple may be known for its secrecy but buried in <unk> municipal archive is a wealth of detail on the project including more than twenty previously unseen renderings of the new campus
in these images we see for the first time the space port like entrance to the <unk> subterranean parking lot a <unk> cafeteria that <unk> into the <unk> landscape beyond and the glass <unk> that will serve as the entrance to apple's new underground auditorium a secure <unk> where press will gather for future product launches
in short these documents give us the most complete picture of apple's new home yet a campus that steve jobs himself thought had a shot at being the best office building in the world
here's a peek at life in the <unk>
apple campus two which was approved by city officials last month will sit on a one hundred and seventy six acre plot in the south bay city of sixty thousand a site that was once home to <unk> and <unk>
if you're an apple employee who drives to work you'll enter the campus at a freshly constructed security point at north <unk> road on the west edge of the site
the lucky ones will quickly be diverted into a <unk> futuristic tunnel where a subterranean service road will give them access to a two level two thousand space parking garage underneath the <unk> itself
otherwise you'll have to wind your way to the south edge of the campus to the above ground parking garage a pair of emory board shaped structures clad with solar panels and foliage
thirteen of the year's best infographics
if you take advantage of apple's shuttle buses from elsewhere in the bay area you'll be dropped off at the corporate transit center on the eastern edge of the site
from there a walkway flanked by two apple store white <unk> will lead into the <unk> itself
this massive <unk> of a building is the <unk> of the campus
designed by star architect norman foster whose <unk> well known works include the bullet shaped <unk> in london and the restored <unk> in berlin the four story ring will put thirteen thousand engineers and designers under a single <unk> roof
it won't be the only place you'll find apple employees on site a cluster of buildings tucked away at the southern edge of the campus will be reserved for <unk>
but the spaceship is definitely the main attraction and from what we've heard so far it should be no less cutting edge than any apple gadget
in a video apple presented to cupertino city officials last month stefan <unk> one of the foster and partners architects working on the project summed the building up as one of the most environmentally sustainable projects on this scale anywhere in the world
the plan is for the facility to run entirely on renewable energy drawing largely from on site fuel cell plants and rooftop photovoltaic <unk>
natural ventilation and <unk> cooling mean that the spaceship won't need air conditioning for some seventy percent of the year
these green efforts are being overseen by lisa jackson a recent addition to the company
if her <unk> familiar there's good reason
jackson headed the epa for the obama administration prior to joining apple as environmental director earlier this year
the internal arrangement of the office is still something of a mystery but it's already come in for some skepticism
some architects have raised doubts about the wisdom of a stubborn circular floor plan at a time where more flexible <unk> <unk> are in vogue
it's worth comparing apple's new circular home to the other headquarters jobs had a hand in designing
as buzzfeed recently reported jobs was heavily involved in the layout of <unk> campus a twenty two acre plot in <unk> california that the studio has occupied since two thousand
the best map ever made of america's racial segregation
most notably jobs insisted on a huge central indoor meeting place known today as the <unk>
looking at the floor plan for apple's vast headquarters it's hard to envision a single similar place where apple's employees will naturally <unk>
still the company insists that the floor plan is designed to promote collaboration
the inner and outer <unk> of each floor will be left open as <unk> allowing employees to circulate around the ring
at one point in the day you may be in offices on one side of the circle and find yourself on the other side later that day peter <unk> apple's <unk> told the san jose mercury news last month
we found that <unk> or squares or long buildings or buildings with more than four stories would <unk> collaboration
we wanted this to be a <unk> building and that's why we eventually settled on a circle
there's no doubt though that it will be a beautiful place to work
the renderings show a headquarters that borrows from the <unk> aesthetic of the retail stores
we're about to lose net neutrality and the internet as we know it
employees will enjoy a massive ninety thousand square foot cafeteria carved into a section of the building from which they'll be able to stroll to the <unk> on both the inside and outside of the ring
after that they can head to the on site fitness center situated just north of the main building
earlier this year <unk> offered a glimpse into some of the details of the undertaking noting unprecedented forty foot floor to ceiling <unk> of <unk> glass that are being manufactured for the four story facade
there isn't a straight piece of glass in the whole building jobs boasted in his initial presentation
the mammoth structure didn't escape jobs <unk> attention to the smallest details either
according to the <unk> report jobs found the industry standard one eight inch breaks between surfaces too <unk> and demanded that the gaps in his new headquarters be no greater than one thirty two inch across
as <unk> the architect says in the presentation video this project is pushing the boundaries of technology in almost every aspect
in the company's own words the new campus will offer a <unk> environment reflecting apple's brand values of innovation ease of use and beauty
despite the <unk> sustainable credentials though the <unk> part of the development isn't even the building itself it's everything surrounding it
the renderings show something that hardly resembles a corporate campus it all
what it is really is a huge park
apple's proposals describe the future landscape as an <unk> rich oak <unk> reminiscent of the early santa <unk> valley
norman foster says that jobs wanted the campus to <unk> the california of his childhood one he still <unk> the fruit bowl of america
what it all means is that david <unk> apple's senior <unk> presumably has his hands full
<unk> and the other landscape designers on the job have plotted the site down to the very last tree
inside the main building not far from a sizable fountain workers will enjoy a cluster of apple trees
over by the entrance to the cafeteria you'll find rows of <unk> plums and <unk> trees with <unk> <unk> just beyond those
more of the same will be found outside the ring on the other side of the cafeteria where employees will be able to <unk> al <unk> in an area apple's calling the <unk>
a dense perimeter of trees will ring the site serving as a visual buffer from <unk> eyes outside
below the main building there will be a vast lawn stretching down to the auditorium and parking decks below
in fact to make room for this continuous green space apple is <unk> <unk> avenue off the map entirely
at a recent planning presentation with the city dan <unk> apple's senior director of real estate and facilities put this dramatic transformation into numbers
today the site is twenty percent landscape the rest covered by buildings and <unk>
by two thousand and sixteen when the new apple campus is complete it will be eighty percent landscape
currently the plot has some four thousand five hundred trees
when apple is done there will be seven thousand
the idea <unk> the <unk> says is to bring california back to cupertino
the campus won't be exclusively for the enjoyment of its employees
every few months a select group of outsiders will be allowed in to visit a separate structure nestled among the wildlife
apple's new corporate auditorium
instead of meeting the press at a venue like the <unk> center in san francisco tim cook has said that the intention is to summon reporters to its custom designed auditorium for all future events
and from the look of things it will be a nice place to see a product launch
instead of a reality <unk> field the new one thousand seat facility sits underneath an actual one with a <unk> runway leading up to the <unk> glass <unk>
visitors will enter through this stark glass <unk> it's topped with a <unk> like roof of its own and descend into a subterranean theater for the main event
these are some of the most <unk> creatures you'll find on earth
the <unk> design isn't altogether unlike that of the fifth avenue apple store in new york city one that steve jobs reportedly <unk> himself in its earliest stages
and by all accounts jobs was hands on in the development of the new campus too
in a presentation video foster recalls the genesis of the collaboration when jobs called the architect out of the blue one day in two thousand and nine
hi norman i need some help jobs said and three weeks later they were meeting in person
one of the most memorable things and perhaps vital to the project was steve saying don't think of me as a client think of me as one of your team foster says
as with so many of apple's products the unique blend of vision and precise detail won't come cheap
earlier this year the <unk> report put the project's budget at five billion dollar and growing
and again the wisdom of the design is up for debate
there's no telling if the ringed design floor plan will foster collaboration or stifle it
still a stubborn adherence to a singular vision is what gave us <unk> products like the iphone and the ipad
maybe the formula will work for a headquarters too
as <unk> the apple <unk> told the cupertino officials in october when it comes to the new campus you can be sure that following <unk> lead we've used the same care and the same meticulous attention to detail we put into every apple product
even as it celebrates <unk> sales of its new playstation four sony is offering help to gamers experiencing problems with the next generation gaming console
released at midnight friday the playstation four or ps four sold more than one million units in north america in its first twenty four hours according to sony
but with any massive hardware rollout some <unk> are sure to surface
and the ps four is no exception
sony has addressed what some are calling the <unk> blue light of death an error that occurs when customers try to power up
just brought home my brand new ps four and when turn it on all it does is blink blue
one user wrote on sony's playstation support site
i am overly upset that i spent most of my day waiting in line in the cold
not a happy customer to say the least
some <unk> customers also posted one star reviews on amazon although the <unk> average rating on that site tuesday was a healthy four out of five stars
sony has responded with a detailed <unk> guide for the problem
sony says the complaints could be related to problems with the <unk> power supply hard drive related hardware or connection to an <unk> television
possible fixes include updating tv software as well as <unk> a time honored classic
turning the console off and then turning it back on again
in an earlier statement sent to media outlets sony had already acknowledged a handful of people have reported issues with their new console
the number of affected systems sony said amounted to less than zero point four percents of the units that have been shipped or less than four thousand out of one million
this is within our expectations for a new product introduction and the vast majority of ps four feedback has been overwhelmingly positive the statement said
we are closely monitoring for additional reports but we think these are isolated incidents and are on track for a great launch
the playstation four has received generally positive reviews from critics
the ps four release was the first in a two thousand and thirteen <unk> of the video game console wars between the three big manufacturers
microsoft sony and nintendo
microsoft's xbox one is set to be released friday and nintendo released its wii u last year
google says it will replace a google maps image after a california father complained it shows the body of his teen age son who was shot to death in two thousand and nine
jose barrera of richmond california said he discovered the image visible on google maps satellite view feature last week
when i see this image it's still like that happened yesterday barrera told <unk> tv in oakland a cnn affiliate
and that brings me back to a lot of memories
kevin barrera fourteen was shot and killed in two thousand and nine
police discovered his body near a railroad track in richmond on august fifteen of that year at an address that roughly matches the one of the scene in question
his killer has not been found
our hearts go out to the family of this young boy
said brian <unk> vice president of google maps in a written statement sent monday to cnn and other media outlets
google has never accelerated the replacement of updated satellite imagery from our maps before but given the circumstances we wanted to make an exception in this case
<unk> said replacing the image will take about eight days and that google has spoken to the barrera family to let them know we're working hard on the update
the image which was still accessible on google maps on monday afternoon shows a police <unk> and a small group of people standing near what appears to be a prone human form near a set of train tracks
cnn will not show the image without approval from the slain <unk> father
messages left for barrera had not been returned as of tuesday morning
barrera had said he planned to formally complain to google and to lobby state lawmakers for their help in removing the image if needed
what's the point to show those pictures to the people you know pictures of my dead son
he said
this is really painful to the whole family
people frequently ask google to remove content they find <unk> on its maps pages including street view and google earth
in many cases the company declines such requests though it's not a sure thing
your privacy and security are important to us the company writes on a google maps privacy page
the google maps team takes a number of steps to help protect the privacy and anonymity of individuals when images are collected for street view including <unk> faces and license plates
you can easily contact the street view team if you see an image that should be protected or if you see a concerning image
the page says users can also request the removal of images that feature inappropriate content
google's unprecedented ability to attach imagery with its maps product has been controversial for years
as early as two thousand and eight a pennsylvania couple sued google over their home being pictured on street view
they argued the value of their home which they purchased in part for privacy was diminished
google was ultimately ordered by a judge to pay the couple one dollar
the u.s. military prohibits google from capturing images of military installations and the company has cooperated with a request to remove ones that already existed
some privately owned communities also have succeeded in asking the company to remove street view and satellite images from maps
google has faced even <unk> opposition outside the united states to its mapping services
in germany where opposition came from political leaders as well as privacy <unk> households were eventually given the option to opt out of street view
images of about two hundred and forty thousand german addresses were blurred out in the <unk> first few months there
nasa's curiosity rover found evidence for what scientists believe was an ancient flowing stream on mars at a few sites including the rock <unk> pictured here
the key evidence for the ancient stream comes from the size and rounded shape of the <unk> in and around the bedrock according to the jet propulsion laboratory <unk> science team
the rounded shape leads the science team to conclude they were transported by a vigorous flow of water
the grains are too large to have been moved by wind
google began an ambitious project in two thousand and <unk> to scan and index the world's paper books and make them <unk> online
nine years later the company has overcome a major roadblock in its mission
on thursday a judge dismissed a class action lawsuit against the google books project brought by authors who claimed the project violated their <unk>
by sheer numbers the google books project has been a huge success
more than twenty million books and magazines have been scanned using optical character recognition technology making each word or phrase <unk> so snippets of text are part of google search results
it also has been a lightning rod for controversy
google did not seek approval to scan many books that were still under copyright nor did it offer to compensate authors or publishers in any way claiming the scans were fair use
the program doesn't put entire books online for free
if a book is still under copyright search results will only show the brief section that includes the word or phrase searched for and the page number it appears on along with details about the book itself
google compares the system to a card catalog
books that are out of copyright can be viewed in full and even downloaded and people can buy books whose authors or publishers are part of google's partner program
as we have long said google books is in compliance with copyright law and acts like a card catalog for the digital age giving users the ability to find books to buy or borrow said a google spokesperson
because the company only shows snippets of the books in search results it claims the project falls under fair use
fair use is an exception to copyright law that allows <unk> work to be <unk> or used in certain circumstances typically by altering or using the original work in a new transformative way
the use of book text to facilitate search through the display of snippets is transformative judge <unk> chin said in his ruling
he said the google books program provided benefits to the public
it advances the progress of the arts and sciences while maintaining respectful consideration for the rights of authors and other creative individuals and without <unk> impacting the rights of copyright holders said chin
opinion
why i took on google over orgy images
the ruling notes that the majority of the books scanned are out of print and that google provided digital copies to the libraries that allowed them to scan their collections
the books scanned are also primarily nonfiction titles which have less copyright protection than fiction
the google database is used by researchers <unk> and educators and greatly expands access to books around the world by putting them online
by converting print to digital text the program has also made it easier to convert titles into more accessible formats like text to speech and <unk>
this has been a long road and we are absolutely delighted with today's judgment said the google spokesperson
the late fall chill outside a best buy store in <unk> maryland wasn't all that was keeping george <unk> awake late thursday
i've been a ps dude since the first ps said <unk> the first in line to pick up a playstation four when the clock struck midnight
i'm not planning on sleeping tonight
i've got a six hour energy drink
i'm all set
he and about one hundred others were there for the next step in the evolution of home entertainment
the new playstation hit stores a week before microsoft's xbox one does the same touching off a new round in the fight for the hearts of console gamers
it was a scene that played out at thousands of stores across north america
in new york sony rented out the entire standard high line hotel in manhattan where roughly five hundred people showed up to watch a light show of video game scenes as they waited for the midnight launch
matt and <unk> <unk> of laurel maryland picked up their two new pre ordered consoles at the <unk> store one to keep and one they plan on selling on ebay
matt said he's more of a sports gamer and really wants to see what next year's madden will be like when it is designed specifically for the new console
it is the latest and greatest and i want to see what they can do he said
i'm really wanting to see what games will be coming out next because they will be built just for the ps four
this is built more like a gaming <unk>
the first new home console for sony in more than seven years the playstation four incorporates many new features over its predecessor the playstation three
greater focus on social interaction during gameplay a redesigned controller with a <unk> interface and expansion of streaming entertainment choices are just a few of the new elements for ps four
andrew house president and group ceo of sony entertainment said building this next generation console took nearly seven years and that sony had specific goals in mind to reach today's launch date
having a shared experience on the same sofa in front of the same screen is something that i as a parent want to have with my family house told cnn during the ps four launch event in new york city this week
a device that is designed from the ground up to be able to serve up all those different kinds of experiences but with a great user interface that's designed to work specifically in the living room i think is still very very important
with more than a million pre orders reported by sony in august it would seem the public was ready to get their hands on the latest next generation console
analysts expect the demand for the system to <unk> supply through christmas
people were coming in early this week just to get games that were released and extra controllers brooks <unk> home sales manager at the maryland best buy said
they were making extra trips to the store just to make sure they had everything they wanted for when they got their new ps four
<unk> <unk> minnesota native is one of many military personnel stationed in the area who spent hours outside the store
he hadn't pre ordered but remained hopeful
i just like the experience of standing in line meeting new people sharing gamer tags <unk> said
you get to chat around with all kinds of people
it is fun
the lines were <unk> guys in their twenty s and thirty s and some in line were hoping to score the perfect gift
<unk> <unk> a twenty one year old college student attending <unk> university waited with her mother in the chilled night air
but <unk> said she wasn't getting the ps four for herself
i'm getting the game for my brother for christmas she said laughing
i'm a good sister
he owes me
the excitement though didn't mean everything has gone perfectly for sony's rollout
<unk> yoshida president of sony's worldwide studios tweeted that the company is investigating reports of broken consoles but said the problem isn't widespread
be assured we are investigating reported ps four issues he wrote on twitter
the number is very small compared to shipped we believe they are isolated incidents
over the next few months playstation four consoles will go on sale in other countries around the world with the final launch date set for february in japan
the last time a new playstation or xbox hit the market facebook had fewer than twelve million users a tablet was a pill and nobody outside of apple had heard of a gadget called the iphone
that was more than seven years ago
it's a vastly different technology landscape that will greet sony and microsoft in the coming days when the two old rivals go head to head again with <unk> new consoles
sony's playstation four hits stores on friday with microsoft's xbox one coming a week later on november twenty two
between them they account for two of the gaming world's big three
the venerable playstation and xbox remain the fiercest rivals for the hearts and minds of so called hardcore gamers the <unk> who stand in line for intense intricate titles like call of duty that pull in more cash than hollywood blockbusters
but it was two thousand and five when the xbox three hundred and sixty hit the market and a year later when the playstation three debuted
now the two platforms will be competing for holiday dollars in a world where anyone can boot up a video game instantly on a phone or tablet and in which streaming and cloud technology mean most major video game titles can be played as easily on <unk> up pcs
even the now ubiquitous facebook which now has one point one billion users plays a role
tens of millions of people play games on the site daily
so which of the two rivals if either will cut through the clutter and prevail
it remains to be seen though the fight has already begun
earlier this year microsoft reversed course on poorly received plans to require xbox one users to be online while playing and to limit how much digital games could be shared or <unk>
but that wasn't before sony got in some shots of its own
early reviews of the ps four have been positive with time dot <unk> matt <unk> praising it as everything sony's learned about platform design honed and polished to something just shy of perfection
the xbox one will get its chance to shine next week
and the debate over which platform is better will continue long after the new consoles start landing in homes
until then here's a tale of the tape look at some of the features of two devices

which console do you prefer and which features are most important to you
let us know in the comments
are you open yet
a <unk> asked
it was ten a.m. on a sunny fall day here where a small group of staffers met a cnn camera crew outside of smitten ice cream
by the time the doors officially opened two hours later a handful of others had <unk> about when they could get a scoop
the people wanted their ice cream
you see this is not your typical ice cream <unk>
here at smitten we actually make every single batch of ice cream to order explained store founder <unk> sue fisher
so nothing is frozen until you order it and we make everything from scratch that morning
using seasonal and local ingredients <unk> team creates creative flavors like cinnamon apple <unk> <unk> brown sugar squash and meyer lemon <unk>
smitten doesn't use <unk> <unk> or <unk> in any of its ingredients
and because its creations are frozen before your eyes in seconds the process involves some serious science
we do get super nerdy about our ice cream and we get nerdy because we think it makes a better product said fisher
no wonder vogue called smitten arguably the <unk> if not the best ice cream on earth
after a few years in the corporate world and attending the stanford graduate school of business fisher decided to follow a childhood dream
my mom used to tell me that i had two <unk> and one of those was solely reserved for ice cream fisher said
so the little girl with the big appetite invested her life savings teamed up with some engineers and spent five years <unk> ice cream machines in her backyard
the final product was a high tech patented <unk> called a <unk> machine
those who serve the <unk> smooth ice cream at smitten are <unk> named <unk>
each order takes about ninety seconds to make and many customers took full advantage of that wait by snapping pictures and videos of the <unk> machine in action
<unk> pour in organic cream along with other ingredients and set the <unk> in motion
it <unk> and spins and the mixing bowls become surrounded by a fog of evaporating liquid nitrogen
we use nitrogen because it's super super cold
it's actually negative three hundred and twenty one degrees fahrenheit explained fisher and a super super cold freezing process actually has the ability to make a smaller ice crystal and a smaller ice crystal means a really really smooth product
one of three different patents for the <unk> machine is a double <unk> <unk> that's designed to <unk> every surface of itself and every surface of the bowl to develop the tiny ice crystals
it also has smart software that's programmed to know when the ice cream is ready to be served
a smaller ice crystal makes a <unk> more <unk> texture said fisher so our ice cream is actually a lot <unk> than other ice cream in addition to being a lot more fresh
but before the brick and mortar store and the frenzy of <unk> fans fisher had to hit the streets to dish out her treats
she rigged up a radio flyer <unk> with a battery pack to power the <unk> and tweeted her location for the day
i was totally broke and that's why the only thing i could do was sell ice cream out of a radio flyer <unk> which was a super amazing way to learn about what people wanted said fisher
i tested a bunch of different flavors and i already had teamed up with our amazing chef <unk> <unk> and so she made a different flavor every day
i'd pick it out at her house and go into the street
the combination of fresh ingredients the magic of the <unk> and word of mouth proved to be a winning combination
this past summer we served over twenty thousand people a month out of this tiny little three hundred and twenty square foot shop so that's a pretty good number for us fisher said
smitten plans to open up three new locations in the san francisco area within the next year
we're keeping it local but we're going to be spreading the smitten love fisher said
netflix users who stream video to their televisions will be seeing a major overhaul in the next few days
the company has announced what it's calling the biggest update ever for its more than forty million streaming customers rolling out a more visually rich design that will be the same regardless of what kind of device is used to bring videos from the internet to the tv
this is the biggest change in how netflix looks on a tv said chris jaffe netflix's vice president of product innovation
netflix says that the majority of the one billion hours of video its users stream each month is viewed on televisions via tv apps or devices like the roku blu ray players or gaming consoles
under the new format which began rolling out wednesday clicking on a show or movie will call up a full page description with multiple images and an explanation of why netflix recommended it for you
descriptions of the videos will be sharper netflix says and users who choose to let netflix access their social media profiles will get recommendations based on their activity and friends activity as well as on videos they've watched in the past
until now most versions of netflix streaming looked like a relatively flat grid consisting of row after row of suggestions based generally on what kind of videos had been streamed by the user in the past
the new interface which has been two years in the making is a visually striking departure from the familiar grid of movie tiles and boxes and it is designed to be mirror the experience of tv watching
you click the remote and something happens wrote miguel <unk> in fortune
other new features include expanded support for netflix profiles a way to let people in the same household customize their experience and support for voice controls on xbox three hundred and sixty
post play the feature that automatically starts the next episode of a tv show you're watching or suggests others when you're done also is being redesigned
netflix says the update will take about two weeks to reach all devices which include playstation three playstation four xbox three hundred and sixty roku three and new and future smart tvs and blu ray players
some older smart tvs and blu ray players may receive the new look if manufacturers update them and the overhaul will be added for the roku two box early next year
one set top box that won't be getting the update is apple tv
that system has specific <unk> that are set by apple according to netflix
netflix says it has more than thirty one million u.s. subscribers to its streaming service plus almost ten million international subscribers
fossil fuels are going to run out
this much we know
no one is entirely certain when they will run out exactly but we know it will happen eventually
some estimates suggest we have about seventy years of coal gas and oil left
the fossil fuel industry itself insists that we have significantly longer
but everyone agrees they will run out in due course
so how will the world be powered when we can't rely anymore on fossil fuels
why with <unk> waves wet wood and solar power from space
to compensate for the decline of traditional energy sources researchers around the world are developing innovative new technologies that between them may provide a long term solution to our rapidly growing energy needs
some are familiar some may seem far fetched and some could potentially pose as much of a threat to the environment as fossil fuels themselves

how swarm robots are learning from insects
cnn takes a look through some of the more interesting and unusual energy technologies currently under development
the idea of collecting solar power from space has been under consideration since the one thousand nine hundred and seventy s. putting solar panels into orbit offers a few obvious advantages over regular solar power such as not having to deal with atmospheric interventions and not losing any productivity at night
in the past trying to get a power plant to the edge of the earth's atmosphere seemed deeply unlikely
but john <unk> a former nasa engineer now with the <unk> group has been working on a project that he believes will make such an audacious idea simple
the basic concept of the solar power satellite is to deploy a large platform in space near earth <unk> says typically in a high orbit where the sun shines almost constantly where it would harvest sunlight convert it into electricity and then transmit it to receivers on earth for use

can africa unlock its solar potential
some have suggested that lasers could be used to transmit the energy from space
<unk> says that in his view this is possible but potentially dangerous
instead his project aims to use low intensity microwave <unk> which he believes will be safer
<unk> says that the energy yield from a solar power satellite could be significant potentially delivering up to one thousand two thousand mw of power to the earth
to put it into perspective he says a typical home in the u.s. requires about four five kw of power or about one hundred kw hours per day or about three thousand kw hours per month or about thirty six thousand kw hours per year
so a single <unk>
would for example deliver power energy for roughly two hundred and forty thousand four hundred and eighty thousand homes
some critics say the project would be <unk> expensive or that getting something so large into space presents challenges
others note that the energy yield is still not high enough to make the project worthwhile
still the fact that it is being considered by nasa <unk> it significant weight
so perhaps it is not so out of this world after all
last year work began on a new plan to extract heat from the hot rocks that lie under and around <unk>
by injecting water into cracks in the ground researchers hope that they may be able to create steam to power subterranean electricity turbines
two companies <unk> energy and <unk> <unk> were granted permission to test this procedure in the land around the <unk> volcano in oregon in a process that critics argue is not dissimilar to the controversial technique of <unk> <unk>

nuclear fusion is the perfect energy source
over the past twelve months <unk> <unk> or <unk> has been the subject of protests around the world but in fact it has been around since the one thousand nine hundred and sixty s. the ceo of <unk> susan petty said in a company blog post that creating multiple reservoirs from a single injection multiplies the amount of energy that can be extracted from each production well and will extend the life of the well and increase the energy recovery from each well significantly improving the economics of enhanced <unk> system power generation
but <unk> is known to potentially generate earthquakes and as noted by wired magazine practicing a similar technique beneath a volcano that the u.s. geological survey says is certain to <unk> again seems an odd choice
whether the technique can yield significant energy return and be conducted safely is still a matter of debate as heated as the <unk> volcano itself
wave energy is already being used across the world
billions of dollars have been invested in the technology and the world's first wave farm opened near <unk> in portugal in two thousand and eight
at the european marine energy center in <unk> scotland the world's biggest wave farm was approved for construction earlier this year
the forty mw farm off the north west coast of lewis promises to deliver enough energy to power nearly thirty thousand homes
wave farms deploy massive <unk> to turn the motion of waves into power
<unk> power the company running the project in <unk> says that its huge yellow <unk> have a maximum generating capacity of eight hundred kw
the bright yellow machines measures twenty six meters across and are installed at a depth of around thirteen meters around five hundred meters from the shore
the advantages of wave power are similar to those of wind the waves are free but there are some additional benefits
in particular it's easier to forecast wave energy output because waves are driven by wind but don't vary as rapidly
they build up more slowly and <unk> more gradually
that makes the energy from waves more predictable than that from wind or solar which means that it is easier to integrate into the power grid
at present the uk is the world leader in the technology with the u.s. portugal and france also significant players
researchers working in a laboratory in <unk> uk believe that their <unk> sized particle accelerator like the large hadron collider in switzerland but much smaller could offer a genuine alternative to fossil fuels
powered by <unk> a naturally occurring radioactive substance the small scale collider could generate significant amounts of energy
the mail on sunday estimates that just one ton of <unk> could produce as much energy as two hundred tons of uranium or three point five million tons of coal
the idea of <unk> reactors is one that is under a lot of discussion these days
clearly the physics will work says <unk>
but he notes that there are always hazards in using nuclear material
even though it certainly would be safer than past nuclear reactor approaches it seems likely to me that governments are not going to want a lot of radioactive material on the highways
biomass power involves the breakdown of biological material such as leaves and wood to produce <unk> like hydrogen and methane which in turn can be burned
the problem with some existing biomass power plants is that they need the biological materials to be dry
jens <unk> <unk> a danish inventor has come up with a new type of biomass <unk> that can trap moisture from damp materials and export it as hot water
<unk> benson believes this could allow his new <unk> to generate up to thirty percents more energy

what's unique about biomass says <unk> <unk> is that you can store it
you never really know when the wind is blowing
with biomass we have the control to use it when we need it
wind is the resource we have most of in denmark danish climate and energy minister martin <unk> told cnn and we need biomass and <unk> to have the back up for when the wind stops blowing
critics argue that burning biomass contributes carbon dioxide to the atmosphere but its proponents suggest that such damage can be offset by growing crops specifically to be burned
one of the most substantial indicators of the viability of alternative energies can be seen in the growth in investment from venture <unk> and other private investors
william <unk> from the university college london energy institute notes that venture capital investments in clean energy went from less than one hundred million dollar a year in the late one thousand nine hundred and ninety s to over ten billion dollar a year in two thousand and eleven
in the year two thousand most alternative energy technologies were considered niche options that might one day show promise now they're multi billion dollar industries significant enough to <unk> serious trade disputes between the us eu and china <unk> says
government investment has shown a similar pattern but significant public and private sector research money is still going into fossil fuels
new <unk> and processing technologies for coal oil and gas are still the main focus of private sector research and development
however many experts <unk> included believe that this may change by two thousand and twenty five when alternative energies could finally stop being regarded as alternative
the best photographs work on multiple levels capturing what's happening on the surface while <unk> two dimensions to invite viewers to dig into <unk> pictured
that's literally the idea behind nick <unk> x ray photographs
he uses five x ray machines to take probing photos that provide an intimate even eerie look into everything from robots to firearms
sometimes i think about the process as a <unk> for life he says
you are often attracted to people by their physical appearance but you fall in love with them because of who they are
it's what's on the inside that counts
same thing here
thirteen of the year's best infographics
the english photographer makes most of his photos in an eight hundred square foot studio with concrete walls thirty inches thick
the lead door weighs one thousand two hundred and fifty <unk> or more than two thousand seven hundred pounds
the heavy fortification is necessary because veasey is constantly <unk> his subjects with radiation
he says the machines he has emit a type of radiation that doesn't <unk> the object after it's been x <unk>
his studio isn't large enough to photograph an airplane obviously
anything that won't fit inside is <unk> and photographed in pieces
veasey then combines all those images into a <unk> using photoshop
how a radical new teaching method could unleash a generation of geniuses
there are other tricks involved
instead of shooting the entire fuselage of the boeing seven hundred and seventy seven which is two hundred and forty two feet long and has a wingspan of almost two hundred feet veasey shot one curved section and <unk> it in photoshop
and he shot just three rows of seats because <unk> dozens of rows would have made the photo too crowded
i try to be as accurate as possible but i'm also working within certain constraints he says
even with these tricks veasey says he shot more than one thousand pictures of the airliner to create the final image
if one of the pieces of the plane was too big for the fourteen x seventeen inch x ray film he uses he had to combine multiple exposures
the skeletons featured in some photos were captured in one of two ways
for some of the photos veasey used a <unk> preserved in a pressurized suit borrowed from a nearby college
others relied upon skeletal models <unk> technicians use to train on
the best map ever made of america's racial segregation
veasey is working on several new projects at the moment
one is about famous guns like the m sixteen and <unk> <unk>
another project looks at robots
he chose robots because they're getting more sophisticated by the day and he wants to look inside to see what makes them tick
a third and larger project focuses on classic cars including the ford model t the mercedes benz three hundred <unk> <unk> and the iconic mini
to get around the problem of <unk> the cars something the owners almost certainly would <unk> upon veasey has tracked down an x ray machine in germany big enough to shoot them intact
apple's fingerprint id may mean you can't take the fifth
he chose older cars because he's a classic car fan
but he also favors classic cars because modern vehicles are packed to the <unk> with technology with would <unk> up his shot air bags electronics etc
classic cars are simpler more elegant and would make for far more interesting photos
all these cars are beautiful things in the flesh but i also want to celebrate the engineering that went into making them he says

adrenaline pumping photos from some of the world's biggest <unk>
it looks like google glass was just the beginning
google now appears to be aiming a few inches lower working on a temporary electronic tattoo that would stick to the user's throat
google owned motorola mobility has filed for a patent published last week for a system that comprises an electronic skin tattoo capable of being applied to a throat region of a body
the patent says the tattoo would communicate with smartphones gaming devices tablets and wearable tech like google glass via a bluetooth style connection and would include a microphone and power source
the idea is that wearers could communicate with their devices via voice commands without having to wear an <unk> or the the glass headset
and how's this for future tech
it could even be used as a lie detector
<unk> the electronic skin tattoo can further include a <unk> skin response detector to detect skin resistance of a user the ten page document reads
it is <unk> that a user that may be nervous or engaging in speaking <unk> may exhibit different <unk> skin response than a more confident truth telling individual
<unk> is a reference to the way some surfaces even skin conduct electricity
in images attached to the filing the tattoo appears to be between a postage stamp and a band aid in size
the filing says that in addition to sticking via an <unk> to the throat the tattoo could go on a collar or a band around the user's neck
other possible uses include making both incoming and outgoing audio clearer
that could mean anything from making smartphone conversations clearer in a crowded room to being able to listen to music without <unk>
and we can't quite figure out the use case for this one but
the electronic tattoo can also be applied to an animal as well
with google glass the company has moved to be at the forefront of the rapidly emerging trend in wearable tech
glass is a wearable computer with a smartphone like display that lets users text browse the web take photos and run other apps all hands free
the latest version rolling out to field testers includes an ear bud in response to complaints from some that the first <unk> bone conduction sound system didn't work well
it's not hard to envision the throat tattoo as an eventual answer to that complaint
other wearable tech either on the market or the horizon includes smartwatches from samsung and sony with google apple and microsoft expected to join the fray soon
a motorola spokesman said the company has no comment about the patent filing at this time
in the <unk> future imagined within the popular <unk> franchise robots learn to think self replicate and eventually kill their human masters
while this bleak vision <unk> a number of seemingly distant technological and political developments some ideas currently driving robotics research may for some bear an uncomfortable resemblance to those of the eighty s sci fi smash
in particular one area where life seems to be <unk> art is the <unk> field of swarm robotics in which scientists are creating teams of robots that can work together toward a single goal from <unk> a leak to clearing mines with minimal or no input from humans
much of the research is based on the observed behavior of <unk> insects such as ants <unk> and termites who work collectively on complex tasks without central management or higher order intelligence
consider for a moment a typical <unk> nest with its <unk> of chambers and <unk> corridors
it's built entirely by vast teams of micro sized <unk> <unk> creatures without so much as a blueprint to work from
so the question for researchers is
how can we emulate this type of behavior in robots to help us solve problems and generally make our lives easier
recently researchers at massachusetts institute of technology unveiled m blocks robots that can assemble themselves into different shapes to perform a range of basic tasks without input from a human controller
while m blocks may not look particularly inspiring the way they reshape is the first step toward a future where robots rebuild themselves to solve new problems
an m blocks based robot working underwater might make itself narrow to fit through a deep sea <unk> or a tiny team of medical robots could spread themselves flat to plug a gap in the human heart all without having been pre programmed to do so
at the moment researchers are still working to make teams of robots complete more basic tasks
<unk> university researchers for example are using swarms of robots to fetch carry and push objects in unison
dr <unk> gross head of the natural robotics lab at the university of <unk> says
we are developing artificial intelligence to control robots in a variety of ways
the key is to work out what is the minimum amount of information needed by the robot to accomplish its task
that's important because it means the robot may not need any memory and possibly not even a processing unit so this technology could work for <unk> robots for example in medical applications
some of the most interesting applications for swarm robotics exist where robots go beyond the realm of easy human reach say into space or under the sea or as gross says inside the human body to perform medical tasks at a microscopic or nano scale
aaron becker a <unk> researcher at rice university has been working on an experiment to test different ways swarm robots can be deployed with a view to seeing nano robots eventually used in medical operations
the project seeks to demonstrate how teams of robots could be utilized with minimal input from the outside world possibly beneath the surface of the skin in a bid to tackle disease
but how might this be done
researchers at the <unk> laboratory in montreal are looking at using swarms of miniature drones to fight pathogens within the human body
<unk> <unk> the <unk> research chair believes that preliminary research conducted in his lab could lead to future treatments where small magnetic robots are inserted into the body to fight cancer
other researchers are investigating ways to use <unk> robots in diagnosis so that problems are detected before they become life threatening
becker believes that in future swarms of nano robots might even come to be used in surgery
if we can shrink the surgeon and their tools while maintaining their effectiveness non invasive surgery could revolutionize health care
i want to be a part of that dream becker says
jan carlo <unk> a member of the swarm robotics laboratory at <unk> university in melbourne australia says that there are plenty of worthy applications for swarm robots but some scientists working in the field worry that their research may end up being used for military purposes
some potential application areas for swarms of robots are
cooperative search in disaster sites to support rescue efforts pollution detection and monitoring mine clearing exploration mapping and dynamic motion capture for the film industry he says
however all this comes at a cost as this technology also will be exploited by defense agencies all over the world
the u.s. defense force has investigated how the hunting strategies of wolf packs <unk> and killer whales can be used in military contexts
the israeli defense force is also investigating how one can use miniature robotic mosquitoes in the same context
and while the apocalyptic events of james <unk> <unk> two
judgment day are relatively unlikely it is reassuring that many within the swarm robotics community are determined that their work will be applied to the right ends
the big challenge <unk> says is not only to <unk> technologies that can be used in the real world but also to ensure that swarm robotics technology will be used for the <unk> of mankind
how hard is it to create a website to help people get health insurance under the affordable care act
for three twenty year old programmers in san francisco it took about three days worth of work
spurred by the problems that have surrounded the rollout of the official <unk> site the trio created an alternative health sherpa quickly and cheaply
at first glance it looks like a triumph of tech startup <unk> over government <unk>
george <unk> who created the site along with <unk> <unk> and michael <unk> said all three of them had tried using the government website to get insurance
we were surprised to see that it was actually fairly difficult to use healthcare.gov to find and understand our options he told cnn
given that the data was publicly available we thought that it made a lot of sense to take the data that was on there and just make it easy to search through and view available plans
the result is a bare bones site that lets users enter their zip code plus details about their family and income to find suggested plans in their area
the health sherpa is a free guide that makes it easier to find and sign up for health insurance under the affordable care act
we only use carefully vetted publicly available data the site reads
the health sherpa is not affiliated with any lobby trade group or government agency and has no political agenda
the sherpa are an ethnic group in nepal some of whom have long served as guides for people climbing mount everest and other mountains in the himalayas
the name has come to be used <unk> for any kind of guide or mentor
of course it's not fair to compare the creation of health sherpa to the rollout of the more complicated government aca site which everyone from president obama on down has acknowledged as a <unk> botched affair
for one you can't actually use heath sherpa to sign up for coverage
the site states that it's for research purposes only and that users must verify the premiums and subsidies they find there with state health care exchanges insurance companies or on healthcare.gov itself
it isn't a fair apples to apples comparison <unk> said
unlike healthcare.gov our site doesn't connect to the irs dhs and various state exchanges and authorities
furthermore we're using the government's data so our site is only possible because of the hard work that the healthcare.gov team has done
but it does cast light on the difference between what can be done by a small group of experts steeped in silicon valley's anything is possible mentality and a massive government project in which politics and bureaucracy seem to have helped create an unwieldy mess
creating the original sherpa site took three days and cost several hundred dollars according to <unk>
the three programmers have continued fine tuning the site as its popularity has grown
in less than a week the site has had almost two hundred thousand unique visitors and over half a million page views he said
we've heard from people of all ages and walks of life and thousands of people have reached out to us directly via email phone and twitter to thank us to and to suggest features and request improvements he said
tens of thousands of people have clicked through to buy a specific plan suggesting that we are achieving our goal
helping people find a health insurance plan
maybe the obama administration can learn from the sherpa example
as it <unk> to fix the heath care site the government has sought to inject a little more silicon valley into the process by <unk> a tech surge of staffers from oracle and red hat as well as michael <unk> a site reliability engineer on leave from google
in space astronauts go for years without a fresh supply of water
floating in a capsule in outer space they wash and drink from the same continuously recycled source
so why asked swedish industrial designer <unk> mahdjoubi do we not do the same on earth
this was the concept behind the <unk> shower a high tech <unk> system that <unk> water while you wash
in the eyes of mahdjoubi we should start doing it now before it becomes a necessity
so how does it work
similar to space showers it works on a closed loop system
hot water falls from the tap to the drain and is instantly purified to drinking water standard and then pumped back out of the <unk>
as the process is quick the water remains hot and only needs to be <unk> very slightly
as a result it saves more than ninety percents in water usage and eighty percents in energy every time you shower while also producing water that is cleaner than your average tap
with my shower which is constantly recycling water you'd only use about five liters of water for a ten minute shower
in a regular shower you would use one hundred and fifty liters of water thirty times as much
it's a lot of savings explains mahdjoubi
according to research carried out by his company orbital systems these savings translate to at least one thousand off your energy bills each year
mahdjoubi proposed the <unk> shower while studying industrial design at the university of <unk> in sweden
his concept formed part of a collaborative project with nasa's johnson space center which looks to drive design concepts that could potentially assist space <unk>
in an extreme environment such as a space mission to mars design concepts are brought forward to use all of the possible resources to make it there and back
i don't see any reason why we can't be as efficient on earth as we can be in space he says
according to the u.s. environmental protection agency one point two trillion gallons of water are used every year for <unk> in the united states alone
and yet rather <unk> across the world more than three times the population of the states lacks access to any clean water at all
the concept of a water saving shower is by no means a new one but when cnn's blueprint team caught up with mahdjoubi at his offices in <unk> southern sweden he explained that because it doesn't compromise on comfort it's different to the rest
it has a higher than average water pressure and a very stable flow because unlike conventional showers it works independently from other appliances
this year his showers were installed for the first time in <unk> <unk> a coastal bathing house in sweden
during the summer months more than one thousand <unk> come and swim waters rich with <unk> algae and <unk> before <unk> off
it's not just an exotic environment for application but it's an extreme field test because the showers are on pretty much constantly for about ten hours per day
and the feedback has been good
at the bathing house cnn introduced mahdjoubi to danish industrial designer <unk> <unk> <unk> who recently designed <unk> <unk> train station
<unk> <unk> was keen to talk about the wider potential of <unk> design
my interest is not in the objects but in the system
there will be so many applications for this
if deployed on a bigger scale the <unk> technology developed for <unk> could be used in taps and drinking <unk> in the world's developing countries where water related illness is <unk>
everybody should save as many resources as possible says mahdjoubi but obviously these showers would be even more beneficial for people living in areas with water shortages
i want to get it to as many people as possible
that's the next step
it's not just about saving water
the motivation is to be smart about how we use our planet's resources
a texas company says it has made the first metal gun using a three d printer taking the debate over people's emerging ability to create their own firearms to a new level
solid concepts a specialty manufacturing company said in a blog post it has fired more than fifty rounds from the handgun even hitting a few <unk> eyes at more than thirty yards
the pistol is a version of an m one thousand nine hundred and eleven a handgun designed by john <unk> and first used widely in the latter stages of combat stemming from the philippine american war
it's built from thirty three mostly stainless steel parts and has a carbon fiber <unk> carved with a laser
the three d printed metal gun proves that three d printing isn't just making <unk> and <unk> heads the company said in the blog post
solid concepts went out of its way friday to point out that producing the metal gun isn't meant to advance a trend that worries law enforcement and some politicians
as three d printers become more widespread and affordable some envision a near future in which criminals can crank out <unk> weapons without having to leave their homes
let me start out by saying one very important thing
this is not about desktop three d printers alyssa <unk> a spokeswoman for the company wrote in the blog post
the metal gun wasn't a move toward making firearms with a three d printer cheaper or more accessible she wrote
basic three d printers such as the makerbot <unk> two can be bought for around two thousand dollar
but solid concepts used a specialized high end printer whose cost would be out of reach of most people
the industrial printer we used costs more than my college tuition <unk> said
and the engineers who run our machines are top of the line
they are experts who know what they're doing and understand three d printing better than anyone in this business
solid concepts wanted to show that three d printing is more than just hobbyists churning out plastic <unk> it's a viable option for serious commercial use
it's a common <unk> that three d printing isn't accurate or strong enough and we're working to change people's perspectives kent <unk> a vice president at the company said in a statement
in may a nonprofit group also from texas stirred far more controversy when it posted a video of the live firing of a plastic handgun created with a three d printer
<unk> wilson a twenty five year old self described <unk> posted instructions on how to make the gun online through his nonprofit group defense distributed
those instructions were taken down after the u.s. state department sent the group a cease and <unk> letter
the group's website was shut down shortly afterward
solid concepts is a licensed firearm manufacturer
it said one use for its new capabilities with three d printers may be selling replacement parts for handguns

what buttons are seen more than twenty two billion times every day embedded on seven point five million websites
answer
the facebook like and share buttons according to new numbers released by the social network
and now these most widespread of online icons are both getting their first ever redesign
see also
facebook being sued over like button
the biggest difference you'll notice straight away
the thumb is gone from the like button
instead it will appear in the dialogue box above the button that shows you how many likes your post or page has
the new button features the facebook f logo instead
it is white on blue rather than blue on white as is the new share button
the share button will replace facebook's send button deemed too confusing
the reason for the redesign
the new version is <unk> for high resolution screens according to peter yang a product manager at facebook in the comments section of the facebook blog post announcing the change
users should start to see the change on those seven point five million websites as it rolls out over the coming weeks
two professors both alike in dignity in fair geneva where we lay our scene
when it is finally written the story of one of the greatest scientific discoveries of our age may begin something like this
last month two eminent professors peter higgs and francois <unk> were jointly awarded one of <unk> greatest <unk>
the nobel prize in physics
the award came on the back of the dramatic announcement last year that the large hadron collider based in geneva had made an astonishing discovery
a new particle a higgs boson had been <unk> proven to exist
physicists around the world <unk> some wept openly
years of speculation theory and research had suddenly been validated
in typical <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> permanent secretary of the royal swedish academy of sciences said this year's prize is about something small that makes all the difference
the discovery came as a major puzzle piece in the way physicists understand the universe
the standard model of physics which some regard as a theory of almost everything suffered from a significant missing link before the discovery of the higgs boson
now there seemed to be a reason why particles have mass
now we had a key to understanding our four percents of the universe and perhaps access to understanding the other ninety six percents of the universe as well
but just as one set of answers were being revealed more questions immediately presented themselves
cnn labs spoke to some of the world's top physicists about what the discovery of the higgs boson means and what questions now need to be addressed
joel butler a scientist at the prestigious <unk> laboratory in illinois said
the big question is why the higgs with a mass more than one hundred times that of the proton is so light
that question is not answered by our picture of the universe
jon <unk> head of physics and astronomy at university college london says that in his view
there are issues like what is dark matter
why is the universe mostly matter not <unk>
<unk> <unk> a professor of physics at uc berkeley says
the main question is this
we have never seen an elementary particle without spin
electron <unk> <unk> etc all have spins
the higgs boson may actually have spin but it is spinning in extra dimensions of space we can not see
we really need to know the true nature and context of this newly discovered particle
to answer these questions the large hadron collider will soon be joined by another massive experimental facility the international linear collider
like the lhc the ilc will be a vast machine that stretches for miles beneath the earth
a site for the ilc has yet to be determined
read
what is the higgs boson
the history of science is replete with machines that have helped scientists make significant breakthroughs providing the kind of <unk> <unk> <unk> data science requires to progress
from marie <unk> <unk> chamber used in the discovery of spontaneous <unk> to <unk> ray tubes which led to the discovery of the electron to <unk> counters and more recently the large hadron collider discoveries have come from equipment both big and small
simple and complex
the ilc sits as the latest in a long line of machines designed to advance physics but what exactly will it do that the lhc can not
tim meyer head of strategic planning and communications at <unk> canada's national laboratory for particle and nuclear physics says that it will be able to produce many more higgs particles than the vast collider in geneva and will offer new levels of accuracy
the ilc will be able to study the higgs precisely he said
it will be a higgs factory and will be able to make measurements of the higgs properties with three percents relative precision as opposed to the <unk> twenty five percents relative precision people believe
the ilc could crack open the higgs and reveal the mysteries of nature's first spin zero particle
brian foster the european regional director for the international linear collider says that it is not impossible that the vast machine could help us discover an overarching theory of everything
if we are lucky the ilc can detect a whole new family of particles that might help us to realize einstein's dream of <unk> all the theories of physics into one overarching and <unk> simple theory foster says
a decision to begin construction on the international linear collider is currently expected by two thousand and fifteen
be kind please <unk> the signs used to say in video stores urging customers to return their rented vhs tapes <unk> back to the beginning
if only blockbuster could <unk> back to the one thousand nine hundred and ninety s
that was the time when the video chain was the <unk> of the movie rental business with stores in seemingly every city shopping district and suburban strip mall in america
visiting the store was a weekly <unk> for many people who would show up on friday evenings to check out the latest releases navigating a crush of couples and families who had exactly the same idea only to find out that the last copy of air force one or the lion king had already been snagged
that custom is now as gone as a world with three television networks a <unk> station's late show and a <unk> space command
on wednesday dish network which purchased blockbuster in two thousand and eleven announced it was closing the <unk> three hundred remaining u.s. based retail stores as well as its distribution centers
consumer demand is clearly moving to digital distribution of video entertainment said dish president and ceo joseph p. clayton in the press release about the closures
his statement echoes many from recent years about the migration of entertainment from physical objects cds dvds books games to bits <unk> and <unk> available on various screens and portable devices
blockbuster will continue its blockbuster home brand to dish customers as well as its blockbuster on demand streaming service
and an additional fifty blockbuster stores not owned by dish will remain open for the time being
the action was long expected
blockbuster had been closing stores for years as is obvious from the yawning <unk> still present in many of those very same strip malls
the chain was done in by netflix streaming video and a world of internet options
reaction from that internet was of course swift and <unk>
several posts on twitter made fun of the <unk> late fees the <unk> of people who couldn't get their rental back in the standard forty eight hours and the vhs tapes that made <unk> name
i knew this day would come
i'm mere months away from owning a vhs copy of the mighty <unk> without paying my late fees to blockbuster wrote brian <unk>
yes
all the blockbuster video stores are closing
that means they'll never get back that vhs tape of <unk> in brooklyn
i won
added actor and comedian paul <unk>
other commenters just shrugged
many said they didn't even realize blockbuster had any stores left
in a headline the new york times put it best
internet kills the video store
but dan herbert author of the forthcoming book <unk> and a film professor at the university of michigan wants to praise blockbuster not bury it
the stores were clean and family friendly with wider aisles and a bigger emphasis on movie selection than the mom and pops that dotted the landscape in the one thousand nine hundred and eighty s he said
they really standardized video rental in general herbert said
as with many franchises at its height blockbuster often came in for criticism
the chain put many mom and pop stores out of business
<unk> its name it generally <unk> to a blockbuster mentality
hit releases filled shelves by the dozens but independent and foreign language films could be hard to come by
the stores wouldn't carry <unk> seventeen films at all
and then there was the blockbuster <unk> easily recognized in a blue knit shirt who was often depicted as either clueless or <unk> depending on how frustrated you were on those crowded friday nights
but herbert a former video <unk> himself though not at blockbuster points out that blockbuster was successful for a reason
it had more variety than many video stores
blockbuster stores were required to have a minimum of seven thousand movies and averaged ten thousand more than many of its competitors he said
by doing so it opened up more of america to more movies
even though blockbuster itself primarily stuck to cities and suburbs it became a model for other chains that opened stores in small towns
if people compared blockbuster to mcdonald's that wasn't necessarily a knock said herbert
they self <unk> modeled themselves on mcdonald's and at various points hired members of mcdonald's upper management he said
but over the last decade business took one hit after another
in a september article the <unk> christopher tucker described how independent video stores were put out of business
the same trends affected blockbuster
first there were dvds which were relatively inexpensive and intended for purchase especially compared to the vhs titles that cost stores up to one hundred dollar a pop
with the advent of broadband people started downloading movies and shows not always legally
netflix and <unk> used the slim size of dvds to their advantage
and finally hulu was launched and your average joe and <unk> were introduced to cloud media tucker said
even <unk> late fees came back to bite the chain in an unlikely way
in one thousand nine hundred and ninety seven a man named reed hastings returned a late copy of apollo thirteen to his local blockbuster
he was assessed a forty dollar fee
two years later he founded netflix
blockbuster was caught flat <unk> by many of these changes
it could have purchased netflix for fifty million dollar in two thousand but passed
as netflix rose <unk> attempts to compete on netflix's terms especially through the mail <unk>
it also tried to compete with <unk> using standalone <unk>
that didn't work either
by the time blockbuster was sold to dish in two thousand and eleven it was down to one thousand seven hundred stores more than seven thousand fewer than its peak just seven years earlier
people had long since started devoting their friday nights to streaming and downloading at home and if they were heading out it wasn't to a blockbuster
the <unk> of course <unk> it
in a two thousand and eight video headlined historic blockbuster store offers glimpse of how movies were rented in the past the <unk> site showcased a michigan venue that aims to transport visitors to a time before the internet
like a version of colonial <unk> it had actors playing <unk> and customers who described how the rental process worked
onlookers watched the performance stunned
it's really amazing that people had to go through so much just to get a movie says a visitor in the <unk>

twenty two with seventeen point four million followers more even than the sixteen million following the band's official account
the other four band members rank twenty nine th thirty five th thirty eight th and fifty three rd each of them with more than eleven million followers of their own
in contrast the beatles have the nine hundred and sixty nine th most popular twitter account
of course <unk> starr doesn't log on to share observations like a little party never killed nobody either
we find something amusing about the fact that twitter's chief rival facebook is among the top fifty most popular twitter accounts
but when you have more than one point one billion users maybe it makes sense that folks want to keep up on their favorite social media site while
well
visiting their other favorite social media site
facebook's nearly twelve million followers put it at no
forty four
but this <unk> is nothing new
in the earliest days of google plus facebook ceo mark zuckerberg was its most popular member
you wouldn't think a revered brazilian <unk> would be satisfied with writing one hundred and forty characters at a time
but <unk> whose one thousand nine hundred and eighty eight novel the <unk> has sold more than thirty million copies is an active user with more than eight point seven million followers
twitter i think is an art <unk> told the guardian this year
because if you're connected to people you learn how to
there's probably not anyone in the world who would be more humble about having eight million followers right
the exiled <unk> spiritual leader account is no
ninety one on twitter
and whether he personally writes the posts or not they come off to anyone who has heard him speak as his authentic voice and tone
consider this account a nice palate <unk> after reading where kim kardashian went shopping last night
apparently <unk> is a big deal in indonesia
this account which awkwardly <unk> itself the largest <unk> in the world has seven point two million followers good for no
one hundred and ten on the twitter list
as best we can tell this is a twitter feed written in <unk> that's the basic equivalent of those one line <unk> you get in the daily paper
stephen fry is famous
but you wouldn't think he'd be this famous twice as many followers as jamie <unk>
the british actor and writer whose credits range from sherlock holmes
a game of shadows to cult favorites black <unk> and doctor who is a perfect fit for the site its one hundred and forty characters just enough to share his dry <unk>
or pictures of <unk> <unk>
either way he's got six point three million followers landing at no
one hundred and thirty one
a mum and a wife with a really cool day job
well yes if being the queen of jordan is a really cool day job
it's not every day you find royalty on networking sites
but she's answered questions from followers online and told <unk> that sites such as twitter can be used to achieve real social change
with nearly three million followers it seems to be working
how does a canadian mom end up with two point seven million twitter followers making her account the site's five hundred and fifty four th most popular
in addition to helping promote her famous son <unk> talks about her projects including an autobiography and offers encouragement to teen mothers such as herself
what's a guy got to do to crack the top six hundred around here
<unk> was one of twitter's founders and has racked up two point four million followers
but come on
that only makes him no
six hundred and forty three on his own site
who says good always triumphs over evil
we <unk> twitter for harry potter and the boy wizard is nowhere to be found
meanwhile lord <unk> is doing just fine for himself thank you with more than two point two million followers
this is a parody account so there are no official ties with creator j.k. <unk> the books or the movies
but we're ok with that
it lets him be even <unk>
live every week like it's shark week
those immortal words come not from the discovery <unk> marketing department but from tracy morgan on thirty rock
believe it or not there once was a time when there was no shark week
it wasn't until famed <unk> jacques <unk> one thousand nine hundred and fifty six documentary the silent world that people began to see what the world under the sea was really like
jacques cousteau changed the way ocean exploration was done said eric stackpole who along with partner david lang is behind a <unk> robotic <unk> sort of an underwater drone that could open a whole new world of undersea exploration
cousteau invited people to explore along with him and so for us it's the same thing said lang
their invention called an openrov is a submarine like robot that you control with your laptop
it gives scientists explorers and other users a glimpse of what lies below the surface without them getting wet
r o v stands for remotely operated vehicle stackpole said
it's got a video camera on it so you can see what it sees live
so i can put this in the water fly it around and see what it sees
the openrov is about the size of a <unk> and is engineered to go to depths of up to one hundred meters
underwater <unk> have been used for research for years
but the biggest difference between the openrov and the one say james cameron uses is the price
the openrov sells for eight hundred and forty nine dollar
it's not what everyone would call cheap but you don't need a grant to get your hands on one
this <unk> is how stackpole and lang hope to bring openrov to the masses turning average people into cousteau like undersea <unk>
plan for a new kind of spy plane
if you think about ocean exploration right now it's something that a lot of people think oh well you know what that's something that professional scientists do that national geographic explorers do
that's not something that i get to do lang said i think that's what we're trying to instill back in everyone
the two met when stackpole was <unk> with nasa and lang was between jobs and both immediately <unk> over the idea of a new way to explore the ocean
when we first met almost three years ago
within ten minutes eric told me a story about this underwater cave lang said
within a half an hour we were talking about well what if we could build an underwater robot that could go and roam the ocean and anyone could go on and control it from the internet
the project started in their garage in cupertino california home to some other famous tech innovators
apple
but once they turned to kickstarter last year they saw how many people were truly interested in taking the plunge
we set a goal for twenty thousand dollar and ended up raising that in about two hours which is really exciting lang said
it's fun to watch the kind of dollar amounts go up but then you quickly realize oh my god we have to build all these things
there are over five hundred <unk> in use now around the globe
even though the project is growing stackpole and lang are sticking with their do it yourself <unk>
the <unk> are an open source project meaning that anyone can hack them to create new features or uses for the devices
lang and stackpole sell the <unk> as kits and customers put them together themselves
it's a process that helps get everyone involved in the production and design aspect
we have people from well over fifty countries in our community who can all contribute to how to make the design better and how to use it better stackpole said
among those interested in <unk> are conservation groups who want to check on invasive fish species and teachers who want to use them in the classroom lang said
building a community of users to provide input is another way the openrov is unique
it also explains the first half of the name
openrov is an open source community stackpole said
if the <unk> is having some sort of a problem and we can't figure out how to handle it i can go onto the forums and post hey this is a problem i'm having and as i sleep the problem is going across europe and people who are experts are answering it because they find it interesting
by the time i wake up it's going to cross the u.s. and by lunch i can have five or six good solutions
with a flow of new ideas coming in from all over the world stackpole and lang have decided not to get a patent for the openrov at least not yet
this makes it easier for them to upgrade with new tech and designs
for us we want to innovate as quickly as possible
we want to come up with new designs and revolutionize how underwater exploration is done rather than committing to one design said stackpole
we've been designing the <unk> around parts that are not even in existence yet but that we know are emerging
as the openrov <unk> and improves this approach may allow for more exploration in uncharted waters
people often ask is it something that's just kind of a toy that's fun to build and play with or is it something that you expect to be used by real researchers
and our answer certainly is both stackpole said
jacques cousteau would certainly be proud
drivers are endlessly creative when it comes to finding dumb things to do while behind the wheel
eating texting reading a map applying makeup
but technology has now inspired an alarming new trend
drivers taking self portraits or selfies with their smartphone cameras while in motion
<unk>
maybe so but these self portrait artists aren't shy about sharing their photos
instagram shows more than three thousand seven hundred and twenty seven posts under the <unk> hashtag more than one thousand eight hundred and sixty nine for the <unk> <unk> and more than nine thousand seven hundred for <unk>
some users add the optimistic tag <unk>
on twitter a search for driving selfie turns up hundreds of images
not all the photos or videos shot by drivers are of themselves
some are of their passengers being <unk> or of pretty scenery <unk> past
all this photo taking requires using at least one hand to open a camera app frame the shot and press the shutter button
taking a photo of yourself while you're driving a two thousand pound vehicle down the road at fifty or sixty miles per hour
that is putting your life in danger and putting the lives of those around you in danger said jackie <unk> president of advocates for highway and auto safety
the trend isn't limited to cars
there are also selfies of people piloting motorcycles boats and even planes
it's not always clear from the photos if the vehicles are in motion or if the drivers waited until they were at a full and complete stop before capturing their very important moment
a few are group shots taken by passengers which keep the driver's hands on the wheel even if his or her eyes are off the road
governments law enforcement and safety groups have been pushing hard in recent months to raise awareness about distracted driving with texting receiving the most attention
for today's young drivers smartphones are rarely out of sight and each ping announcing a new message can be a <unk> song that's hard to resist
if motorists are caught taking self photos while driving they could receive a ticket
using a phone while behind the wheel unless tethered to bluetooth or another hands free system is illegal under many state laws
and wearable devices may be the next target for enforcement
a woman in san diego got a ticket last week for driving while wearing google glass the headset that projects web content on a tiny screen above the user's right eye
more than three thousand three hundred deaths every year are caused by distracted driving according to the department of transportation
taking a photo like checking a text might take only a few seconds but when a vehicle is in motion that's enough time to cause a serious accident safety experts say
the phenomenon is alarming enough that <unk> has released a don't shoot and drive ad aimed at instagram happy drivers
the ad shows a photo of a totaled car edited with various instagram filters
so far the people snapping rolling self portraits appear to be mostly young adults and teenagers
teens are the target of the most recent distracted driving push by the national highway traffic safety administration
according to the <unk> car crashes are the leading cause of death for teenagers
alcohol speeding and not wearing seat belts are major factors but distracted driving played a role in twelve percents of the fatal accidents
the <unk> of the trend may seem amusing especially to the people posting the images but safety advocates warn the potential for injury and death is very real
driving is a really serious thing said <unk>
can you imagine if a pilot crashed and we found out that people in the cockpit were taking selfies

for a big chunk of the cold war the u.s. air force turned to the sr seventy one <unk> for many of its most important spy missions
the jet black jet could fly at more than three times the speed of sound at <unk> of eighty five thousand feet faster and higher than anything adversaries had to counter it
the last of the <unk> flew in one thousand nine hundred and ninety nine and the u.s. military hasn't had anything close since
now lockheed martin the maker of the sr seventy one says the son of the <unk> the sr seventy two is in the works and it will be twice as fast as and way more lethal than its father
that's because the sr seventy two will be designed to launch missiles something the sr seventy one didn't do
even with the sr seventy one at <unk> three there was still time to notify that the plane was coming but at <unk> six there is no reaction time to hide a mobile target brad <unk> lockheed martin's program manager for <unk> told aviation week and space technology
the publication provided the first detailed look at the sr seventy two plans last week
<unk> aircraft coupled with <unk> missiles could penetrate denied airspace and strike at nearly any location across a continent in less than an hour <unk> said in a news release
and by the way the sr seventy two is envisioned as a drone unlike the original <unk> with its crew of two
a pilot and a reconnaissance officer to operate its radar <unk> and spy gear
the sr seventy one was developed using twenty th century technology
it was envisioned with slide rules and paper
it wasn't managed by millions of lines of software code
and it wasn't powered by computer chips
all that changes with the sr seventy two lockheed martin says
a smaller scale model of the sr seventy two could begin testing in five years and be in the air in ten <unk> told aviation week
the full scale sr seventy two could be operational by two thousand and thirty according to lockheed martin
if it comes to fruition one thing the sr seventy two won't be is <unk>
the design needed for the <unk> six speed doesn't allow for such construction according to the aviation week report
speed is the new stealth aviation week quoted al <unk> engineering and advanced systems vice president at lockheed martin's <unk> works division as saying
speed is the next aviation advancement to counter emerging threats in the next several decades
the technology would be a game changer in theater similar to how stealth is changing the battle space today <unk> said in the statement
of course none of this will fly without money and that will probably be up to taxpayers
we have been continuing to invest company funds and we are kind of at a point where the next steps would require large scale testing which would significantly increase the level of investment we've had to make to date <unk> told aviation week
between darpa and the air force it would be highly likely they'd have to fund the next steps
it could be a scene from a cartoon strip and in some ways it i albeit one that has been plastered across the walls of a <unk> restaurant and its car park entrance in the heart of santiago
<unk> of social interactions like this are captured on some of the hundreds of murals that have been commissioned across the city over the past year reflecting a growing trend towards the <unk> of underground culture in the country
graffiti used to be seen as merely an underground expression of youthful rebellion an image reinforced during the years of the dictatorship between one thousand nine hundred and seventy three and one thousand nine hundred and eighty nine
now however it has undergone a makeover as business owners have recognized the potential for using the enduring appeal of this often forbidden art form in advertising
more than a hundred <unk> now work in the city according to local estimates and the number is rising as more artists seek to cash in on the <unk> fascination with guerrilla art

the thirty one year old from <unk> alto a neighborhood on the <unk> of the city is one of the capital's most sought after <unk>
his mantra in life is simple
<unk> <unk> <unk> always go forward
with a waiting list and monthly income <unk> seven hundred and fifty thousand <unk> he now finds himself with semi regular work in a field notorious for not knowing where the next <unk> will come from
it's for this reason perhaps that he seems <unk> when a friend calls in the middle of the interview to tell him he's got yet another commission this one for a <unk> store in the central santiago neighborhood of san <unk>
he's seen demand for his work increase lately but has not lost sight of how unpredictable its <unk> and flows can be
it's a risky business and there's a lot of competition he says
a lot of street artists do this kind of work several at a high level
there are other jobs that guarantee higher pay
fascinated with drawing from a young age <unk> began <unk> cartoons and <unk> <unk> before going on to create his first street mural with a school friend at the age of fifteen
he went on to study graphic design at university and since then has racked up a portfolio of clients ranging from owners of bars and restaurants to night clubs a local council and even a hospital
what's behind the surge in business
globalization he says
advertising these days needs new ideas for how to show your brand or service
graffiti murals have many characteristics
they're fresh modern and huge
public spaces make an ideal setting for them
nowhere is the shift in the public's perception of graffiti more visible than on the two thousand six hundred square meter <unk> <unk> one of the main arteries in the southeast of the city
on either side of a four lane highway a sea of faces and local landmarks appear to jump out of what were previously two blank concrete walls
as part of a renovation program funded by the government the local council of la florida commissioned ten artists with the brief to create the biggest mural in santiago depicting the diverse cultural heritage of the thirty thousand strong neighborhood
it might sound like an <unk> way of spending state funds but in a middle class neighborhood through which a sixth of the city's population commute daily it is also a way of sending a social message
when the mural was completed in february local mayor <unk> carter proclaimed it a demonstration of the integration of different lifestyles
it took the <unk> six weeks to produce the finished image going through five hundred <unk> cans in the process
when complete the result was quite personal
each artist put something into his bit
for example there are dollar signs on the image of the hospital which clearly refer to the high cost of public health in our country said alan
for the private sector graffiti art has become an effective way of capturing the attention of potential clients and generating a buzz on social media
across town in <unk> neighborhoods as well as in historic quarters giant murals have become a permanent fixture on the walls of small and large establishments alike
for <unk> rodriguez the owner of la <unk> a <unk> giving his business the graffiti treatment was a no brainer
lots of people flip out over good street art these days and if your business has something really cool painted on it people acknowledge you more he said
i gave the artist <unk> <unk> to do whatever he wanted
i just told him it should have a latin american feel to it
has it generated more business for him
it's tricky to <unk> any increase in business to the mural he says
but i see our guests and tourists walking by constantly photographing the <unk> and posting the photos on social media
that can only be beneficial for business in the long run
a few blocks away <unk> another <unk> sports a different kind of mural
it has an <unk> feel that makes it easier to take in from a distance than up close
it depicts tall trees in a vast forest <unk> with <unk> to faraway places
buenos aires berlin mumbai
lucas <unk> who commissioned the mural says he wanted to make his business stand out
we felt that through a mural we could represent what we are as a youth <unk> a relaxed friendly place where we have a lot of fun
this is represented in the colors
but not everyone in santiago has embraced the surge in graffiti art
as the number of street murals increases some are now questioning whether the <unk> of what was once a not for profit channel of self expression has gone a step too far
as enterprises <unk> on the creativity of others some people are asking whether the authenticity of graffiti art is being <unk> whether something that once representing non <unk> has been <unk> to promote the <unk> involved in mass consumption
many graffiti artists criticize us because we are doing this professionally says <unk>
they're against the system and they don't like it that we're working for government agencies and brands
it's an ongoing debate with implications for other forms of self expression that have recently been <unk> such as sand animation a form of performance art that involves the manipulation of sand
but the argument often <unk> the practical need to survive in a world where survival is decided by money
in chile and many countries in latin america poverty remains a reality for significant portions of the population
with fifteen percents of the urban population living below the poverty line as recently as two thousand and eleven six point four percents of the population currently out of work and many struggling to get by on the minimum wage of two hundred and twenty thousand <unk> a month the opportunity to turn a hobby into an income is a compelling one
for <unk> like <unk> though what makes him fill his <unk> full of <unk> each morning is less a question of riches than the satisfaction of expressing himself on concrete
there are more profitable ways of making money but they're <unk>
this is my passion
at its best it's like a form of therapy
it's using artistic creation to represent the imagination in a visible way
i find it a very interesting challenge

the technique could prevent mitochondrial diseases but also raises significant ethical issues
the measure was passed in the house of commons three hundred and eighty two to one hundred and twenty eight speaker john <unk> said
a further vote must be held in the uk's upper house the house of <unk> before the measure can become law
passage of the law is opposed by catholic and <unk> church leaders in part because the process involves the destruction of an embryo
one in six thousand five hundred babies in the united kingdom are thought to develop a serious mitochondrial disorder which can lead to health issues such as heart and liver disease respiratory problems blindness and muscular <unk>
problems with mitochondria the powerhouse cells of the body are inherited from the mother so the proposed ivf treatment would mean an affected woman could have a baby without passing on mitochondrial disease
but the cutting edge ivf technique which involves transferring nuclear genetic material from a mother's egg or embryo into a donor egg or embryo that's had its nuclear dna removed raises ethical questions
the new embryo will contain nuclear dna from the intended father and mother as well as healthy mitochondrial dna from the donor embryo effectively creating a three parent baby
the amount of donor dna in the mitochondria will however be much less than the parental dna in the <unk> which determines the baby's characteristics
the church of england's national adviser on medical issues the rev
dr. brendan mccarthy described the step as representing an ethical <unk> and said more research and wider debate were needed
we accept in certain circumstances that embryo research is <unk> as long as it is undertaken to alleviate human suffering and embryos are treated with respect
we have great sympathy for families affected by mitochondrial disease and are not opposed in principle to mitochondrial replacement he said
our view however remains that we believe that the law should not be changed until there has been further scientific study and informed debate into the ethics safety and efficacy of mitochondrial replacement therapy
bishop john <unk> in a statement posted online by the catholic church in england and wales urged lawmakers not to rush into taking such a serious step
it seems extraordinary that a <unk> should be sought for a radical new technique affecting future generations without first conducting a clinical trial he said
there are also serious ethical objections to this procedure which involves the destruction of human embryos as part of the process
the california based center for genetics and society in an open letter to uk lawmakers last month said that although the proposed goal was noble the techniques will in fact put women and children at risk for severe complications divert resources from promising alternatives and treatments and set a policy precedent that experimentation on future generations is an acceptable biomedical fertility development
a team at the wellcome trust centre for mitochondrial research led by professor doug turnbull and based at newcastle university in northern england has been leading the research into the pioneering ivf technique
the center points out that mitochondrial diseases can not be cured and that in many families several people are affected
a wellcome trust fact sheet states that nuclear dna is not altered and so mitochondrial donation will not affect the child's appearance personality or any other features that make a person unique it will simply allow the mitochondria to function normally and the child to be free of mitochondrial dna disease
the healthy mitochondria will also be passed on to any children of women born using the technique
according to the latest estimates from the research team published in the new england journal of medicine almost two thousand five hundred women of <unk> age in the uk are at risk of transmitting mitochondrial disease to their children while in the united states the number is more than twelve thousand four hundred
this <unk> to an average of one hundred and fifty two births per year in the uk and seven hundred and seventy eight births per year in the united states the team said
in a newcastle university news release turnbull said his team's findings had considerable implications for other countries considering the technique
allowing it would give women who carry these mutations greater reproductive choice he said

we have a rich oral tradition and it's important that we document what is happening in history poetry wise she explains
africa has a history of a lack of documentation and we really didn't want this to happen to our poets
kaoma twenty nine is part of the team behind the badilisha poetry x change the largest online archive of african poetry accessible via mobile phone in the world
the badilisha project was originally conceived as an annual poetry festival overseen by the africa centre a pan african organization based in cape town in two thousand and eight
over the following years it grew to become a powerful <unk> for showcasing african <unk>
and by two thousand and twelve the institution decided to move online in an effort to break down <unk> borders and open up their diverse <unk> to a wider audience in africa
following an overhaul of the site last year badilisha <unk> in september making its immersive archive accessible to a broader international following through a mobile first site
it's a <unk> move on a continent where mobile phones have revolutionized critical sectors such as education healthcare and agriculture
adoption of mobile phone use has been prolific in africa with mobile data services going from strength to strength
seven out of ten mobile users in sub saharan africa use their phones to browse the web according to a recent report from <unk>
elsewhere a study by analyst firm <unk> predicted in november that mobile broadband connections in africa are set to rise from ninety six million in two thousand and thirteen to nine hundred and fifty million to cover seventy seven point three percents of all mobile <unk> in the continent by the end of two thousand and nineteen
kaoma adds
a lot of africans use their <unk> to go on the internet and because they are own main target audience we had to <unk> for them and make it easy for them to access this content
to date the project has collected almost four hundred african poets from thirty one countries in africa and across the <unk> in fourteen different languages
since the <unk> users are able to navigate the site through a myriad of options including by theme poet country language emotion or by their top ten list a popular feature curated by a guest poet each month
and it seems their following has embraced the organization's decision to go forward on mobile with an average of three thousand visitors to the site monthly
we want the archive to be a place where people can come and get educated about what other african poets are saying
a place for them to interact with one another says kaoma
there is great value in a kenyan interacting with a nigerian
a nigerian interacting with a south african
also the archive has now reached an international status and it has become a global stage
poets can get the exposure that they usually do not get
cape town based poet <unk> stuart who compiled this month's top ten list says
i don't think the importance of an archive like this can be overstated
it is the first living archive focusing solely on poets from africa and the <unk>
the archive serves a number of purposes
it makes poets available to an international audience and for less known poets this is a chance to be heard beyond their own community city or country
it raises the the profile of poetry from and of the continent while allowing people to engage with the words through hearing and reading them
hot on the trail of poets
two poets are introduced to the platform weekly and each poet profile features a short biography two text <unk> a photograph and audio podcast recordings of the <unk> reading their works
kaoma a poet and writer herself says
it adds so much value to actually hear the <unk> voice recite their work
it adds a different dimension it adds a texture
we really want to give our audience a holistic experience of poetry
if some people just choose to read it that's fine
but if others want to hear it really brings the work to life
meanwhile stuart who also runs poetry and performance workshops says the multi <unk> format <unk> poetry by offering an equal platform to poets working in all languages on the continent and to established and emerging poets
poets can supply their work directly to the organization via the project's submissions page
it is then evaluated by a rolling judging panel who determine whether the work is suitable for badilisha
at any given time we have two or three poets sitting on the panel says kaoma
we try to have a mix of people so we will invite poets to come curate for us
it keeps the selection process exciting and diverse
<unk> the team also approach poets directly to inquire if they are interested in adding their work to the collection
additionally they travel to various nations in search of poets to connect with
we write to publishers or anybody who has access to these poets and build those profiles
we do from time to time have to travel to a specific country
we really have to do a lot of <unk> and digging of the poetry scene and that space
one such voice on the platform is ghanaian born <unk> poet <unk> <unk>
having first encountered badilisha while visiting cape town several years ago he is thrilled to see how the organization has created a burgeoning poetry scene online
i had the chance to visit their studios and to learn more about what they intended to do
it was exciting to see this <unk> idea blossom into what is simply one of the best things to happen to african poetry in a long time
the concept is simple but the impact is massive
<unk> who is also a distinguished actor documentary writer and founder of the prestigious african poetry book fund has not only curated content for the site but he's also featured in this month's top ten compiled by south africa's <unk> stuart
he adds
of course it feels good to see that other poets are engaged by my work
i am not sure what it means really but i have to think that the few <unk> on the site resonate with people in positive ways
i am in good company frankly and i find that an honor
it's a sentiment project manager kaoma says many poets share about their inclusion in badilisha
when we first started there was obviously a bit of resistance
people not understanding how being online works
now as a society we are more accustomed to being online a lot of our activities are based online we shop online so as society becomes more comfortable with the idea of the web so do poets explains the curator
poets are very open to it and they appreciate having such a space there they can engage with one another
badilisha is <unk> funded by <unk> a south african wine estate with additional financing from applications to the government and other private institutions
and in a time when traditional publishers are <unk> away from printing poetry due to lack of sales the project offers poets a new outlet for presenting their work in a digital age
but kaoma is quick to clarify <unk> position as an alternative literary publisher
a lot of publishers right now aren't publishing a lot of poetry we don't want that to be what stops us as poets from having thriving careers
i think we can exist online and maybe when people see how popular poetry really is they can start increasing the number of books being published
i think we can <unk> and work with one another
skytran wants to do away with train schedules and central stations to develop a grid system above the ground with multiple off ramps acting as stations where users can board pre booked pods a cab service for the skies
call for skytran on your smart phone and a computer controlled <unk> <unk> pod arrives
it will <unk> you across the city to your destination
the next big innovation is going to be in automated transit says john cole skytran <unk> and director
transportation will just recede into the background of lives as something that just happens automatically
i think about where i want to go tell a computer where i want to go and it just takes me there seamlessly
skytran says the technology uses only a third of the electricity used by one of today's hybrid cars because its vehicles weigh just three hundred pounds
the first pilot project will be at the campus of israel aerospace industries on the outskirts of tel aviv
the four hundred meter demonstration system is planned for completion by late two thousand and fifteen with the hope of getting the certification needed to build twenty kilometers of track in tel aviv for public use within three years
and there are hopes to expand into cities across europe and asia
building traditional urban roads and <unk> is expensive and requires available land a precious commodity in many cities
one way around that is to go underground with subway systems serving populations well in cities throughout the world but at great cost

huge ship uses its hull as a giant sail
we can build on sidewalks buildings anywhere really and create a whole host of stations for people to choose from says skytran ceo jerry sanders who adds that his system can be built for ten million dollar per mile
but is going up really the way forward
joe <unk> is a smart cities expert based in the united kingdom
as he sees it there's a <unk> horizon for <unk> automated personalized transit
the <unk> test is would you use it yourself
and i would certainly use it
i can see it very much useful for emerging economies and particularly cities that are developing from scratch
ryan chin is managing director of the city science initiative at mit
he says personal rapid transit systems like this one in the last several years may make sense in some limited applications like an expansive airport university corporate campus or something like an expo
but chin is concerned that systems like this only add extra infrastructure to the environment
the construction and operation of the skytran infrastructure is not an inexpensive proposition considering you need to have stations that bring people up and down and in places that don't have enough urban density this will be too far for people to walk to and from and likely remain car dependent
for sanders however if all goes to plan commuters in congested cities around the world could ditch their cars and <unk> and see their transportation tailored to suit their schedules the opposite of today's commuting trauma
being stuck in traffic is just the most stress inducing soul crushing part of society today says sanders
we really want to make people's lives better and elevated high speed transportation is the answer
no one really to pay respect to those first iconic monuments and landscapes except conservationists and wealthy but intrepid travelers
today you can hardly move at many of them for selfie fans trying to capture their next prize monument
but if you're interested in fascinating and sometimes bizarre history these ten world heritage sites are worth your attention
and maybe a trip
they're not necessarily the <unk> or the most famous but they'll certainly grant you a passport back in time

the sergeant surnamed lim threw a grenade and shot at his fellow soldiers at a base in a remote area near the heavily fortified border with north korea in june
two days later surrounded by military forces he was captured after shooting himself in the shoulder
lim committed a <unk> and <unk> crime by killing even unarmed colleagues at the barracks the chief judge of the military court said in the verdict tuesday according to the south korean news agency yonhap
capital punishment is inevitable for such a <unk> crime
military prosecutors had demanded the death penalty for lim on charges of murder and desertion yonhap reported
a death sentence is effectively the equivalent of life in prison without parole in south korea where no executions have been carried out since one thousand nine hundred and ninety seven
around sixty <unk> are on death row in the country
<unk> case will go to appeal at a higher military court defense ministry spokesman <unk> ki hyun told cnn
the soldier's defense lawyer said the court had ignored a lot of testimony about the bullying of his client at the barracks according to yonhap
lim was three months from the end of his <unk> military service when he carried out the attack on his unit
he had been categorized as a soldier in need of special attention according to the defense ministry
there are now more than one thousand unesco world heritage sites these are some of our favorites
he had started a company called earth inspired products that sold <unk> and online orders were strong
mcstay connected with chase merritt who manufactured custom indoor <unk>
the two quickly <unk>
we talked constantly
he came down and had dinner with me and my family once or twice a week virtually every week merritt told cnn's <unk> <unk>
joseph was my best friend
it's a surprising statement considering where merritt is now behind bars charged with murder in the deaths of mcstay
his wife summer
and their two small children <unk> and joseph <unk>
the last time anyone heard from the mcstay family was february four two thousand and ten
for years no one knew what happened to them
police who searched their home days after the family disappeared found eggs on the kitchen counter and bowls of <unk> in the living room along with the family's two dogs
there were no signs of a struggle
the bodies of the mcstay family were found in the <unk> desert in november two thousand and thirteen
police say they believe the family died of blunt force trauma
merritt who is now representing himself has pleaded not guilty
a preliminary hearing has been set for april seven
no trial date has been scheduled yet
but investigators are confident they have the right man
from the start of the case san <unk> county detectives had their eyes on merritt a talented <unk> who was known for his laid back <unk> demeanor
joseph <unk> father patrick teamed up with gina watson who knew his son through work
the two did their own investigating and came across what they say are some troubling inconsistencies
merritt has said he was the last person to see mcstay alive
the two merritt said met for a business lunch in rancho <unk> the day the family disappeared
i am definitely the last person he saw merritt told <unk> in january two thousand and fourteen
asked if mcstay was concerned about anything merritt said no no no
he seemed happy
but patrick mcstay told cnn that merritt told him joseph was upset about a damaged fountain merritt built for him
joseph mcstay also told his father he was frustrated with <unk> work
joey had talked about the quality of some of the <unk> had slipped
and joey wasn't happy with that patrick mcstay said
because he was getting complaints
joseph mcstay had talked to his father about getting another <unk>
merritt also told cnn about receiving a call from mcstay the night he disappeared
merritt said he didn't remember the call until his then girlfriend reminded him about it
the call came he said when they were watching television
merritt picked up the phone looked at it and set it back down
he was tired he said
but when patrick mcstay asked about the call merritt said it was a follow up to their conversation at lunch
san <unk> county district attorney michael ramos said he can't yet say what the motive was but he said his team had been watching merritt on a daily basis
we know there have been many inconsistencies ramos said
his story is all over the place
still the case against merritt may have holes
merritt told cnn he went to the mcstay house after the family went missing and before it was sealed off
officers believe the <unk> were killed in the home but eleven days passed between the family's disappearance and an alert to the sheriff's department
it took san diego investigators three days to obtain the warrants they needed to complete a full search and during that time the home remained unsealed
how reliable is evidence gathered at the mcstay house so many days after investigators say the family was killed there
could one person kill a family of four and bury the bodies one hundred miles away
and the fact that it has been five years since the family went missing does not make the <unk> case any easier
i think the biggest obstacle
is time
because witnesses forget people forget the time frames what occurred etc
ramos said
only eight chinese cities met the country's air quality standards in two thousand and fourteen according to china's ministry of environmental protection although this was an improvement on two thousand and thirteen when just three made the grade
<unk> in the island province of <unk> sometimes called china's bali had the best air quality of the seventy four cities monitored by the ministry
the worst cities were in the industrial province of <unk> near the capital beijing where the average reading of pm two point five tiny particles that can embed themselves deep in the lungs were ninety three <unk> per cubic meter almost triple the country's national standard of thirty five
the world health organization's guideline for maximum healthy exposure is twenty five
<unk> china's most polluted city is home to eleven million people and is perhaps best known for its <unk> meat burgers
the official china daily newspaper said the the government had set targets to <unk> coal consumption and close polluting industrial facilities in <unk> but the province had struggled to find alternative sources of growth
a former <unk> monk has dedicated more than fifty years of his life to constructing his own cathedral in the spanish town of <unk> del <unk>
the fifty six year old detroit man walks twenty one miles every <unk> as part of his journey to and from the factory where he works
i never thought anything i did would garner this much attention robertson said
robertson takes the bus some of the way but for the past decade ever since his car broke down he has <unk> the better part of a marathon each workday
rain snow or shine
after reading about <unk> commute in a detroit free press article from over the weekend college student evan leedy was moved
like robertson the nineteen year old lives and works in two counties so he spends a great deal of time commuting himself
but leedy has a car
leedy decided to set up an online fundraiser to buy robertson a new car
my first car cost three thousand dollar leedy said so i set the goal at five thousand dollar
within an hour we'd raised two thousand dollar
<unk> fundraiser on <unk> has blown past its original goal reaching more than two hundred and fifty seven thousand dollar by tuesday evening
robertson in a video message posted on the free press website gave thanks
everybody calls me the inspiration but to those who have been great enough to donate and everything
it was really so welcome that i don't know what to tell you he said
you guys are the heroes
comments on the page from people donating money suggested that the story of <unk> dedication to getting to work had tapped into a deep well of public feeling
thank you for inspiring me and hopefully tons of other people to <unk> in the face of adversity said a contributor by the name of kevin <unk>
you are a true american hero
we could use more men like james robertson in this world wrote a donor named betty <unk>
<unk> pollack identifies with the strangers words of support
he first spotted robertson during his own work commute a year and a half ago
climbing over snow banks when it was pouring down rain in the summer pollack said whatever the weather he was there
pollack approached robertson who told the financial executive his story
pollack promised to give him a ride the next time he saw him
two to three months later i saw him on a corner pollack remembered and i asked if he needed a ride to work
pollack estimates he's given robertson between forty and fifty rides since then and the two men from vastly different worlds have formed an unlikely friendship
the pleasure pollack said has been all his
i'm the lucky one pollack said
driving him around isn't a <unk> it's a reward
pollack said robertson is inspirational and funny adding that his work ethic puts anyone to shame
i set our attendance standard by this man todd wilson plant manager at the engineering factory told the newspaper
i say if this man can get here walking all those miles through snow and rain well i'll tell you i have people in <unk> ten minutes away and they say they can't get here bull
robertson apparently has a perfect attendance record
he earns ten dollar <unk> an hour not enough to save up to buy <unk> and operate a car in the city according to the newspaper
with the online donations now topping two hundred thousand dollar robertson pollack and leedy met together for the first time monday night
the overwhelming support has extended beyond money and several car <unk> have offered to give him a vehicle outright
now that the effort is so big there's so much more to think about leedy said
there are unfortunately people who want to take advantage of <unk> newfound celebrity and his generosity pollack said
he put together a team that includes an attorney from a large law firm in michigan a <unk> and a certified financial <unk> that he says will ensure the donation money is handled appropriately and in a way that best serves robertson
this money that is being given to him he earned every penny of it leedy said just by his work ethic and his attitude
he's been making the arduous twenty one mile journey from detroit to rochester hills since his one thousand nine hundred and eighty eight honda accord gave up on him
the donations mean that <unk> mode of transportation will likely soon be changing and without the long commute he'll probably be getting a lot more sleep
but he loves where he works so he has no plans to change much else
i can't imagine not working robertson said
it's what i've always done
robertson in his message said he never expected as much support as he has received
he encouraged people to look out for one another
if this story will touch at least one person and inspire them to do something out of the goodness of their heart i will be the happiest person alive he said

having experienced an awful lot of false starts with this and an awful lot of false alarms greste hadn't wanted to set his faith in the egyptian system until he was safely out of the country
but once he had his backside into a seat on the plane the relief was palpable
however his joy was tempered by the fact he was leaving behind fellow al jazeera journalists mohamed <unk> fahmy and baher mohamed
all three were convicted of supporting the banned muslim brotherhood but have maintained their innocence
in addition another seven were convicted in <unk> alongside the journalists
i feel incredible angst about my colleagues leaving them behind said greste
amidst all of this relief i still feel a sense of concern a real sense of worry because
if it's right for me to be free then it's right for all of them to be free
after spending more than a year in such close proximity in a box greste says deep bonds were forged making the moment of walking out of that prison saying goodbye to those guys much more <unk>
over that period i've got to know them
as family he said
they're my brothers
it couldn't be any other way
still he says that his release is a positive step and he hopes that it signals a change in direction from the egyptian government
the sense of <unk> of optimism is so overwhelming greste said
what's very clear is that
for egypt too this is a big step forward
i think everyone has acknowledged that this is a very important moment and i just hope egypt keeps going down this path with the others
sue <unk> an al jazeera english senior correspondent who was sentenced in <unk> in greste's trial spoke to cnn's <unk> <unk> about the possible release of the network's cairo bureau chief mohamed fahmy
fahmy had needed to take the drastic measure of <unk> his egyptian citizenship in his bid for freedom she said
he has now <unk> that citizenship she said
he was really <unk> to do so
he was told by the egyptian authorities that if this was going to happen he was going to have to give away his egyptian passport
it represented an extreme step for the journalist who came from a very patriotic proud military family she said
this is a big deal for him
this isn't just a question of saying oh well
i'll just take a canadian passport and that'll be that
now we're getting quite a lot of diplomatic messages through that it sounds like really his release is very imminent and he is pretty soon hopefully going to be on a plane headed to canada
meanwhile greste's parents spoke to cnn's christiane amanpour about his release
his mother lois greste says that they initially weren't sure that the email that informed them of his release could be trusted
it was pretty difficult to take it in that this was really going to happen she said
but then a couple of hours later we got a call from peter to say that he in the airport and about to hop onto the plane
his father <unk> confirmed that his son's release was a <unk> unexpected development
he was just as surprised as anybody that he was asked to pack his small amount of gear and be ready to leave he said smiling
and now he's free

these are the first photos of castro to appear publicly since august
just last week in a message reported to be from the former cuban leader castro endorsed the <unk> talks to restore diplomatic relations between cuba and the united states but added he still didn't trust u.s. officials
in the letter published on the <unk> website castro said that although he didn't trust u.s. policies and have not exchanged a word with them this does not mean however that i would oppose a peaceful solution to conflicts or threats of war
in december cuba and the united states exchanged prisoners and agreed to discuss normalizing relations that had been trapped in over five decades of cold war animosity
at age thirty two castro led a band of <unk> who <unk> a corrupt dictatorship in one thousand nine hundred and fifty nine
the u.s. broke relations with cuba in one thousand nine hundred and sixty one amid fears that castro and his bearded revolutionaries <unk> communist sympathies
despite scores of cia assassination attempts against him and a failed u.s. backed invasion of cuba castro stayed in power until two thousand and six when an intestinal ailment forced him to step down

clinton regularly used her grandmother status as a rhetorical tool while campaigning for democrats in two thousand and fourteen
federal health officials have expressed concern over a recent measles outbreak that has been fueled by skepticism among some parents of infant vaccination schedules
measles is a disease that children a regularly vaccinated against
the issue has become political despite the fact that claims like vaccines leading to childhood autism have been debunked by scientific research
sen. rand paul of kentucky questioned the safety of vaccines when he said he had heard of many tragic cases of walking talking normal children who wound up with profound mental disorders after vaccines
i'm not arguing vaccines are a bad idea
i think they're a good thing
but i think the parents should have some input he said during an interview on cnbc
new jersey gov
chris christie when asked about the issue said that he choose to vaccinate his children but added parents need to have some measure of choice in things as well so that's the balance that the government has to decide
parents
what is your message to parents who don't vaccinate their kids
former hewlett packard ceo carly fiorina who is also exploring a two thousand and sixteen run told buzzfeed that while she thinks vaccinating for the measles makes sense the decisions should be up to the parents
but renowned neurosurgeon ben carson also a potential republican presidential candidate broke from the pack and defended mandatory vaccinations
certain communicable diseases have been largely eradicated by immunization policies in this country and we should not allow those diseases to return by <unk> safe immunization programs for philosophical religious or other reasons when we have the means to eradicate them he told buzzfeed
but carson aside these comments from paul christie and fiorina contradict with what clinton tweeted and president barack obama said in an interview on sunday
i understand that there are families that in some cases are concerned about the effect of vaccinations obama told nbc news before the super bowl
the science is you know pretty indisputable
both obama and clinton have altered their opinions on this issue though because during the two thousand and eight presidential nomination fight the two left the door open to vaccines causing autism and other issues
obama said the science was inconclusive while clinton wrote in an anti vaccine questionnaire that she was committed to make investments to find the causes of autism including possible environmental causes like vaccine
the republican national committee noted that clinton altered her position in a statement to cnn on tuesday
since hillary clinton is running for president obama's third term it's no surprise she abruptly changed her position just twenty four hours after he <unk> his said spokesman michael short
cnn was given exclusive access to one of those miami international airport and on a recent afternoon employees lined up at a checkpoint where they passed through a metal detector as they reported to work
they gathered their belongings <unk> their badges and opened a door that leads down to the airport's secure ramp area
one of the greatest vulnerabilities for this airport and probably any other major airport like mia is the insider threat lauren <unk> the airport's security director told cnn
miami has four checkpoints for employee screening five vehicle access gates manned by airport workers random background checks of employees and a mandatory security awareness class for all employees among a myriad of other security measures
the only other major airport that conducts full employee screenings is orlando florida according to interviews with aviation officials
there is no federal requirement that the baggage handlers mechanics cleaning crews and other employees with access to the <unk> and other secure areas get screened as passengers do
they are typically subject to a criminal background check and might get randomly screened while at work
by contrast those who work at the gates such as restaurant employees pass through tsa security checkpoints
it's an issue that will be discussed on tuesday at a hearing of a house homeland security subcommittee and follows a high profile case in atlanta
federal agents broke up a gun smuggling operation at hartsfield jackson international airport in december arresting a delta baggage handler and passenger
the baggage handler brought the guns to work entered the gate area and passed the weapons onto a passenger who had already gone through security
the passenger transported guns on about twenty delta flights from atlanta to new york last year according to the arrest affidavit
atlanta unlike miami and orlando does not use metal detectors to screen workers with access to secure areas
a spokesperson told cnn we have expanded random inspections and increased our police presence
in addition the general manager of atlanta's airport is expected to announce security changes at the upcoming hearing according to a source familiar with his testimony
delta declined to discuss specifics but a spokesman said safety and security are always <unk> top priority
cnn contacted twenty major airports across the u.s. to ask about security protocols for the so called back of the airport employees
a spokesperson for seattle <unk> international airport said employees with access to restricted areas do not have to pass through metal detectors but do carry badges verified by biometric scanners
representatives of other airports such as los angeles international airport minneapolis saint paul international airport and <unk> international airport in las vegas said some employees with restricted access pass through metal detectors while others do not
not all employees are required to go through metal detectors sgt
<unk> <unk> with the los angeles airport police told cnn
there are several layers of security that are in place and part of that is training everyone that we are all responsible in ensuring the safety of our airports
representatives from eight airports deferred cnn's questions on metal detector screenings for employees to the transportation security administration which did not provide further information on the topic
logan international airport in boston philadelphia international airport and george bush <unk> airport in houston did not respond to cnn's repeated requests for comment
even <unk> strict security protocol could be vulnerable according to <unk>
it's not one hundred percent foolproof and we know that people are going to exploit the vulnerabilities that they can find she said
we're not just looking for terrorist activity
we have a range of threats
last year the airport confiscated two hundred and nine employee id badges for security violations
the airport has nearly thirty four thousand employees with id badges and thirty three thousand one hundred and fifty who have access to restricted areas
airport police emergency responders and federal law enforcement are the only ones who do not go through the checkpoints <unk> said
miami began screening all employees through checkpoints after a one thousand nine hundred and ninety nine drug smuggling plot in which dozens of ramp and food workers were arrested
a two thousand and seven firearm and drug smuggling case in <unk> airport led to full employee screening as well
in response to the investigation of the smuggling that brought firearms from atlanta to new york sen. charles schumer d new york called on the tsa to require all airline and airport employees to undergo physical screening every time they enter secure areas of airports
schumer referred to the lack of physical screening as a <unk> loophole in airport security in a letter addressed to tsa acting administrator <unk> carraway
when guns drugs and even explosives are as easy to carry on board a plane as a neck pillow then we have to seriously and immediately overhaul our airport security practices schumer said in january
in a statement the tsa said it was taking these recent incidents very seriously and has taken immediate steps to enhance site security at hartsfield jackson atlanta international airport and other major u.s. airports
tsa is implementing or considering a range of measures including additional requirements for employee screening
conducting additional <unk> security <unk> at employee access points
and introducing additional security patrols by tsa teams of law enforcement and screening professionals to specifically address these concerns
additionally tsa has created a working group with representation from airport security partners to further develop plans for improving security
the tsa identified workers with access to secure areas of airports as one of the greatest potential threats to aviation according to a two thousand and nine report by the government accountability office
the report said costs for full screening of airport and airline employees could range from five point seven billion dollar to fourteen point nine billion dollar for the first year of implementation
the entire tsa budget for two thousand and fifteen is seven point three billion dollar
wayne black a miami based security expert told cnn we have a saying in our business
budget driven security will always fail
you don't have to be a security expert a fifth grader can tell you if you are checking at the top end at the front end of the airport you've got to be checking the back end of the airport he said
the two minute ride down seems much longer than that
once we reach the bottom of the <unk> we begin a three point five kilometer walk underground to the site where miners are <unk> coal
for almost an hour we <unk> through the <unk> the light from our safety helmets the only <unk> underground
our protective clothes and faces quickly develop a black layer of coal dust
coal is a polluting fossil fuel which currently powers more than sixty percents of india
the government produced four hundred and sixty two million tonnes of it last year and is targeting a billion tonnes by two thousand and nineteen
typically the coal that burns in power plants across india is of poor quality therefore more harmful
india is already the world's third highest <unk> of greenhouse gases
so why is india so hungry for coal
coal is <unk> available in india which has the world's fifth largest reserves
that's still not enough to feed the country's hunger for the fuel
rapid <unk> and rising demands from the power sector are primarily leading to coal shortages says <unk> <unk> an analyst at the energy and resources institute in new delhi
india resorts to imports to plug the gaps
for the current financial year national demand for thermal coal to produce energy has been estimated at five hundred and fifty one point six million tonnes authorities say
of it at least eighty four point seven million tonnes is being met through imports coal minister <unk> <unk> told the indian parliament in december
the state run monopoly coal india limited accounts for more than eighty percents of the output
prime minister narendra modi's plans for future <unk> of this crucial industry faced resistance recently when <unk> workers stopped work in january
the two day strike the biggest of its kind in four decades not only severely limited the ability of the companies to meet their production <unk> but forced the government to go slow on reforms
around three hundred million indians still live in darkness without access to electricity
that's the entire population of the united states
coal remains an economical way to provide power a cheaper fuel than several other sources
aware of international pressure to reduce its greenhouse gases india is trying to ramp up alternative energy options
blessed with months of sunlight it's giving solar energy a big push
the current government has announced plans to produce one hundred <unk> of solar energy by two thousand and twenty two
compared with the three <unk> india produced last year it seems ambitious
but <unk> <unk> <unk> a renewable energy campaigner for greenpeace india believes it can be done
by making the policy regulations more transparent and increasing investments on infrastructure this <unk> of one hundred <unk> can definitely be pulled off he says
however in order for it to happen policy makers regulators solar companies roof top owners and off grid users must cooperate
india is also moving ahead with a civil nuclear deal with the united states
progress was made when u.s. president barack obama visited new delhi last month but it will take years for nuclear energy to power india in a significant way
it's a balancing act for modi who has to manage international pressure regarding climate change on the one hand and domestic pressure at home to illuminate lives and homes in india
deep underground miners work around the clock seven days a week to power the country
it's hoped in the future newer <unk> technology will be in place to spare the environment and share the load
among them was frank <unk> who arrived in manila at the age of eight
he recounted his experience in his biography escape to manila
from nazi <unk> to japanese terror
my father got a lot of positive attention coming from a place where jews were exiled and treated so poorly said his daughter of his escape from europe
frank <unk> died in two thousand and six
the filipinos were incredibly kind and treated him extremely well
there was an element of something so <unk>
manuel <unk> the first president of the philippine commonwealth and a group of americans that included future u.s. president dwight d. eisenhower and the <unk> the jewish american brothers became increasingly concerned about the treatment of jews in europe during the late one thousand nine hundred and thirty s
they had a shared view of the world they were men who understood what was happening in europe said russ <unk> co producer of the documentary rescue in the philippines
that documentary was screened in the philippines with the country's president <unk> <unk> in attendance last year
over poker the men devised a strategy to bring jewish refugees to the philippines
the philippines commonwealth remained under u.s. supervision so it could not accept people who would need public assistance
the refuge committee sought highly skilled professionals such as doctors mechanics and <unk>
by one thousand nine hundred and thirty eight a stream of refugees arrived including a rabbi doctors <unk> and even a conductor herbert <unk> who survived <unk> concentration camp and later became the founder of the manila <unk>
<unk> ambitions to settle ten thousand jews in the southern island of <unk> were dashed as the the war arrived to the shores of the philippines
for the european jews who arrived in the philippines it was a cultural shock said <unk>
we didn't know the language
we had never seen any other than white people before
the humidity was thick the heat <unk> and the mosquitoes gigantic
but the young jewish refugees saw the philippines as a new adventure
children climbed <unk> trees swam in the bay and learned filipino songs
<unk> became friends with local neighbors played <unk> and <unk> tropical fruit such as <unk> and <unk>
life in manila was running around in <unk> and summer clothes
the experience differed for her parents
it was very difficult for my parents she said
they never really learned <unk>
they had been <unk> and they stayed mostly within their circle of other immigrants
many of them lived in crowded community housing where fights would break out
they had gone from being wealthy in germany to having nothing
it wasn't what they'd known before in germany <unk> said
at the same time they were able to practice their religion able to <unk> and have businesses
<unk> <unk> days of playing under the manila sun came to an abrupt end as the war came <unk> to the philippines
starting in one thousand nine hundred and forty one the japanese occupied the philippines
in some respects the jewish refugees were treated considerably better than filipinos
what ironically protected the jews was their german passports with the <unk> they were viewed as allies
it occurred to me later that's what kept us from being <unk> said <unk> <unk> who was seven years old at the time
the japanese <unk> british and american residents in camps
filipinos and american soldiers were forced to march sixty five miles in the infamous <unk> death march in which an estimated ten thousand prisoners died
japanese officers confiscated residents homes and also <unk> crops for its military
the local economy <unk> and food became scarce
life under the japanese was hard and brutal surviving refugees said
when allied forces began taking back the philippines bombs fell daily
families hid in bomb shelters not knowing where the next one would fall
frank <unk> spent days hiding in a ditch shaking with a <unk> covering his head
one of <unk> friends died after stepping on a mine
fires were going on all the time said <unk>
you could see the black clouds smell of bodies lying there and decaying
as the japanese were losing manila the imperial troops launched a brutal urban campaign
rapes torture beheadings and <unk> of civilians were widely reported so much so that a japanese general <unk> <unk> was later executed for having failed to control his troops
the japanese decided to destroy manila
they were going to give them a dead city they set about doing that said <unk>
they burned they killed
but war time in the philippines was <unk> to being in a concentration camp she said
the <unk> urban street fighting for manila left the capital in ashes <unk> its economy and infrastructure
the philippines suffered nearly a million civilian deaths during the war
despite the trauma of facing both fronts of the war <unk> remains grateful
we would not be alive today if not for the philippines
we would've been destroyed in the <unk>
in two thousand and nine a monument honoring the philippines was erected at the holocaust memorial park in the israeli city of <unk> <unk>
the monument shaped like three open doors thanks the filipino people and its president for taking in jewish refugees during the holocaust
many of the descendants of the jewish refugees who fled to the philippines have not forgotten their family's place of refuge
when typhoon haiyan struck the philippines in november two thousand and thirteen the disaster brought in relief workers from the american jewish distribution committee
danny <unk> who is related to <unk> and is the son of a jewish refugee to the philippines headed its assessment team
for me it was like coming full circle and i couldn't help but think of what it must have been like when my grandparents and mother arrived seventy six years ago he said
my going to the philippines after typhoon haiyan was very special
i was <unk> a debt to the country that saved my family
the modest artificial football pitch looking out over the murky water is a far cry from the sporting <unk> in the brazilian city of sao <unk> that jorge rodrigues once <unk> as a teenage prospect with the great <unk> club or from the brazilian under <unk> national team where he played with ronaldo arguably one of the greatest footballers to have ever played the game
but as rodrigues puts a <unk> of seven and eight year olds through their <unk> thousands of miles away in asia all that matters is he's still involved in football
he's now thirty nine and looking towards the next stage of a <unk> playing career that has led him from the brazilian leagues through russia finland south korea and ultimately hong kong
rodrigues or <unk> as he's known is one of hundreds of players who have taken the road less traveled turning out in obscure leagues for even more obscure teams just happy to be making a living from the sport they love
coaching kids is a new thing for rodrigues to supplement the dwindling appearances for his current team second tier citizen <unk>
alongside some other professionals from hong kong's modest football league structure rodrigues has founded a business passing on his and his partners not <unk> skills honed over <unk> careers
the january transfer window has now slammed shut and some of europe's biggest teams have concluded headline grabbing deals such as gabriel <unk> move from spanish side <unk> to london's arsenal or teen sensation martin <unk> transfer to real madrid from norwegian club <unk>
some of those at the other end of the <unk> spectrum meanwhile look back at a lifetime of moving from club to club
while he never reached the dizzying highs that he might once have dreamed of rodrigues says he is enjoying life
at the moment i want to stay in hong kong
i started this company three years ago
it's starting to go
i feel at home
i love this city and while i don't know my future i want to do more coaching courses
i think i could become a good coach
when he was a kid things couldn't have looked brighter
picked for the under <unk> <unk> the national team he played alongside one of brazil's all time greats ronaldo
but while the <unk> <unk> genius went on to turn out for world famous teams like inter milan barcelona and their great rivals real madrid rodrigues career took him to less storied destinations
when we play for citizen we're playing in front of three hundred four hundred
in russia it was maybe ten twenty thousand people
for <unk>
he <unk>
fifty thousand
despite this though he says he feels content that he's making a living from the game
not just me but my family you know
when i was eighteen nineteen playing for <unk> then going to russia making a bit of money
i was thinking to provide for them
here in hong kong the money isn't one hundred percents comfortable but it's good
it's not easy to be a professional every kid in brazil wants to do it
<unk> along somewhere towards the bottom of the league pyramid is a <unk> way to make a career
for german midfielder <unk> <unk> of army united <unk> fc and <unk> <unk> <unk> fc in bangkok thailand offered an escape
<unk> moved from german top division side <unk> ninety six down the <unk> to teams in the country's lower divisions and in two thousand and twelve took on a new and unexpected challenge on the other side of the world
unlike plenty of his compatriots who see the southeast asian country as the perfect winter getaway the footballer had never visited thailand before undertaking a brief fact finding mission after his agent had identified army as a potential club for him
i thought ok it's a big step to move to another country but thought it might be worth it
i came over for a couple of days looked at the club and facilities looked at and everything was great so i said ok done why not
now i've been here for three years
i had no idea in my mind what was going on when i first arrived
now i can understand a little bit and speak a little bit but it's a difficult language
now i have a lot of thai friends and it's getting better
he says his first weeks and months were really difficult
i came to a very different place the football was different the culture
when you come from europe there isn't much difference between clubs in england spain but when you come here everything is different he says
the <unk> of the thai league didn't help mention of it in the european press is rare if not unheard of
<unk> tried in vain to learn a little more about the clubs he would be playing for and against but most of the websites he looked at hoping to <unk> scraps of information were in thai
he was basically flying into a <unk> culture blind
he says the first few months were tough with the added expectations of being a foreign import
adapting fully he says took almost a year
now that he's settled and with a new club he says that the team culture in thailand is more relaxed
in europe if you lose you're angry maybe looking to blame someone but here they're happy ok we lose but tomorrow
it's not a problem
adam hughes is another international <unk> who has turned out for teams in australia england and ireland before making a move to the icy north of china and the city of <unk>
i wanted to have a go in asia
thought long and hard
it's time to go to asia and have a go over there he tells cnn over the phone
i'd been to asia
china japan and korea with <unk> playing in the asian champions league so had gained a little bit of experience and that's what probably opened my eyes enough to say ok i'm ready to give this a shot
i initially signed a one year contract to test the water
he wasn't the first <unk> to <unk> his trade in china's super league indeed with australian star tim <unk> reportedly signing for chinese side shanghai <unk> he is far from being the last
advice from his former newcastle teammates the brothers joel ryan and adam griffiths who was invaluable in making up his mind
but it was tough going at first
when you first come in you're trying to get your head around the food the language
you're trying to learn china because it's such a different culture
once you've started adapting and understanding it's a very beautiful place to be
china's very <unk> once you understand it
<unk> <unk> may not be up there alongside the likes of manchester united real madrid or bayern munich but hughes is proud of his journey and where he's ended up
i wouldn't say i've been lucky
i worked extremely hard to be where i am and i've put everything into the game
what i've got out of my career so far has definitely been out of hard work and doing a little bit extra
if you've got the passion for it a little bit of ability and work ethic and you can make a living out of football
he is being held without bail and is expected to be <unk> on tuesday
knight forty nine faces up to life in prison if convicted in the fatal hit and run
he is accused of running over two men and killing one following an argument
the man who died has been identified as terry carter fifty five
the second man's name is <unk> sloan fifty one
knight who was out on bail in a separate robbery case is charged with with one count of murder one count of attempted murder two counts of hit and run with an allegation that he committed a serious and violent felony while out on bail the district attorney's office said in a statement
he has prior convictions making this a third strike case it said
knight turned himself in to los angeles sheriff's department investigators early friday
cnn affiliate kcal tv and the los angeles times quoted his attorney james blatt as saying knight feared for his life and was trying to flee when the incident happened
we feel strongly mr. knight did not do anything wrong in this matter
he was attacked by a number of individuals
that has already been corroborated by certain witnesses
he left the scene because he was in fear for his safety and life he said
knight founded the wildly successful death row records in one thousand nine hundred and ninety one signing artists such as snoop <unk> dogg and tupac shakur
knight was driving the car in which shakur was a passenger when the rapper was shot to death in las vegas in one thousand nine hundred and ninety six
shortly afterward knight spent several years in prison for violating parole on assault and weapons convictions
that prison time along with <unk> death <unk> between knight and a number of rappers and <unk> by dr. dre snoop and others contributed to the <unk> bankruptcy in two thousand and six
in august knight and two other people were shot while inside a celebrity filled sunset strip party hosted by singer chris brown on the eve of the mtv video music awards
kentucky sen. rand paul joined new jersey gov
chris christie on monday morning in asserting that the choice should be left up to the parents
and buzzfeed highlighted comments made by former hewlett packard ceo carly fiorina last week defending parents rights on the issue
the scientific community overwhelmingly agrees that vaccines are needed to protect the public and the centers for disease control and prevention has provided assurances that the united states has the safest most effective vaccine supply in history
with the outbreak of the measles epidemic in december after the disease was eradicated from the u.s. in two thousand the scientific community is mobilizing to counter the anti <unk> movement which has grown over the past decade
related
cdc says one hundred and two measles cases in january most stemming from disney outbreak
paul in comments on conservative talk radio show host laura <unk> show monday said he's not anti vaccine at all
but particularly most of them ought to be voluntary he added
paul cited incidents where you have somebody not wanting to take the smallpox vaccine and it ruins it for everybody else
i think there are times in which there can be some rules but for the most part it ought to be voluntary paul went on
while i think it's a good idea to take the vaccine i think that's a personal decision for individuals to take
he also said he was annoyed that his kids were supposed to receive the hepatitis b vaccine as newborns and that he had doctors space out the ten vaccines they wanted to give his infant children over time
and in a later interview with cnbc paul suggested he had seen the negative effects of vaccines that those in the anti <unk> movement cite in their opposition
none however are widely supported by the scientific community and paul's office did not respond to a request for comment for details
i've heard of many tragic cases of walking talking normal children who wound up with profound mental disorders after vaccines paul said
i'm not arguing vaccines are a bad idea
i think they're a good thing
but i think the parents should have some input
christie also took a measured approach saying that while he <unk> his own children parents should be able to choose
all i can say is that we vaccinate ours
i think it's much more important as a parent than as a public official and that's what we do he told reporters during his trip to england on monday
he went on to say that's part of making sure we protect their health and public health
i also understand that parents need to have some measure of choice as well
so that's a balance the government has to decide christie added
asked whether he was advocating leaving parents the option to not vaccinate their kids christie said i didn't say i'm leaving people the option but that it depends what the vaccine is what the disease type is and all the rest
and so we have to have that conversation
it has to move and shift to disease type
not every vaccine is created equal
not every disease type is as great a public health threat as others christie said
he went on to say that the debate over whether to vaccinate children should measure whatever the perceived danger by the vaccine is and we've had plenty of that over a period of time versus what the risk to public health is
shortly after christie's comments were picked up by national media his spokesman kevin roberts issued an email clarifying the governor's position asserting that states should have jurisdiction over the issue as they currently do
the governor believes vaccines are an important public health protection and with a disease like measles there is no question kids should be vaccinated
at the same time different states require different degrees of vaccination which is why he was calling for balance in which ones government should mandate he said
christie's careful dance on the issue reflects the potential political trouble brewing over the question of whether parents should vaccinate their children
the democratic national committee knocked christie for putting on a tin foil hat and bowing to junk science warning him to sit down and shut up before people actually get hurt in a release
another group of potential two thousand and sixteen ers also weighed in on the need for children to be vaccinated
texas sen. ted cruz told reporters tuesday that children of course should be vaccinated and also jumped to christie's defense a potential foe for the republican nomination
this issue is largely <unk> stirred up by the media cruz said
nobody reasonably thinks chris christie is opposed to vaccinating kids other than a bunch of reporters who want to write headlines
cruz added in a statement that vaccines have tremendous public health benefits
but on the question of whether kids should be vaccinated the answer is obvious and there's widespread agreement
of course they should
we vaccinate both our girls and encourage all parents to do the same cruz said
sen. marco rubio of florida who is also weighing a presidential run was unequivocal
children should absolutely be vaccinated and the practice should absolutely be mandatory he said tuesday
rubio added to the heap of doctors and experts who assert there is no link between vaccinations
if enough people are not vaccinated you put at risk infants that are three months of age or younger that have not been vaccinated and you put at risk immune suppressed children that are not able to get those vaccinations rubio said
so absolutely all children in america should be vaccinated
gov
bobby jindal said in a statement tuesday he has no reservations about the benefits of vaccines and urged all parents to get their kids vaccinated
there is a lot of fear <unk> out there on this
i think it is irresponsible for leaders to undermine the public's confidence in vaccinations that have been tested and proven to protect public health jindal said
science supports them and they keep our children safe from potentially deadly but preventable diseases
personally i would not send my kids to a school that did not require vaccinations
president barack obama weighed in on the issue during a sunday interview with nbc urging parents to get their kids vaccinated
i understand that there are families that in some cases are concerned about the effect of vaccinations he said
the science is you know pretty indisputable
we've looked at this again and again
there is every reason to get vaccinated but there aren't reasons to not
but despite obama's insistence that the science supporting the need for vaccines is indisputable the vaccine debate has been problematic for republicans in the past
former texas gov
rick perry came under fire in the primaries from opponents during his two thousand and twelve run for president for issuing an executive order that mandated all young girls must receive a vaccine that protects against some forms of cervical cancer
he eventually flipped on the mandate and supported the texas <unk> decision to overturn it saying he made a mistake
if i had it to do over again i would have done it differently he said then
indeed carly fiorina in explaining her position to buzzfeed referenced that vaccine as one worthy of concern
paul decried it as well
she drew a distinction between a vaccination when a girl is ten or eleven or twelve for cervical cancer and one for measles
i certainly can understand a mother's concerns about vaccinating a ten year old she said
i think vaccinating for measles makes a lot of sense
but that's me
i do think parents have to make those choices
that's pretty much the basic idea behind still lives a thought provoking series of portraits by photographer <unk> dudik
these images reveal a whole new perspective on america's civil war re <unk>
but they also aim to spark conversations about two things that touch us all
life and death
for generations enthusiasts and history <unk> have been spending their weekends re staging historic clashes of the war between the states pretending to lose their lives on the battlefield
dudik uses his camera to study these faces while they fake death
some have their eyes closed
some open
some looking away others looking directly at us
the subject is unsettling
but because we know they're really alive it's somehow <unk>
i think there's a shifting back and forth between life and death as you look at them dudik said
when there's this <unk> and this shifting i think it holds our attention a little longer which hopefully brings us into each of our own individual conversations about what life and death means and what war means to us as individuals
admittedly the concept is a heavy one
to make it more approachable dudik injected a bit of humor
he started collecting reasons why re <unk> choose to live or die during their performances
after dying on <unk> one hundred and forty eight times longtime re <unk> ed doc keith told dudik he has decided to quit dying
now dudik said keith leaves the dying to the young
that statement really stuck with me dudik said
and it propelled him to jump feet first into the project
another re <unk> told dudik at historic gettysburg pennsylvania that he doesn't die very often because he's one of the few that are actually in shape and can make it all the way across the battlefield
a third re <unk> said he dies almost every time because he finds it more realistic dudik said
another guy told me he doesn't die in the high grass because he has allergies
two thousand and fifteen marks one hundred and fifty years since the war's end
the death toll totaled nearly five hundred thousand union and <unk> soldiers according to the u.s. department of veterans affairs
<unk> project helped him understand and respect the solemn reasons behind the re <unk>
still lives was inspired by its sister project broken land which focuses on landscapes linked to the civil war
i've always been fascinated by war in general since i was little not so much in a romantic way but more in a frightening way dudik said
it's always kind of scared the crap out of me basically
the dramatic rift the nation felt in the one thousand eight hundred and sixty s reminds him of today's political landscape
i feel like the country is basically paralyzed by the divide in politics dudik said
when it comes to equipment this guy <unk> totally old school
dudik shot the project entirely on film using what photographers call a view camera which has a basic design dating back to the nineteen th century
projects can become more collaborative with a view camera dudik said
during the still lives portrait shoots he enjoyed explaining to the re <unk> how the camera works and its long exposure time
dudik photographed each re <unk> as they laid on a suspended platform giving the impression they were hovering above the ground
dudik then climbed up a ladder to access his camera which was aimed down toward the re <unk>
once underneath the <unk> dark cloth he opened the shutter and captured an image
i personally don't enjoy digital photography that much dudik said
i don't have anything against it
i think it works <unk> for lots of applications
but for me i'm pretty devoted to film for
the way i work with it
and the way it looks
dudik thirty two spent most of his first sixteen years growing up on a sheep farm in central pennsylvania before moving with his family to maryland
his interest in taking pictures eventually led to college degrees in south carolina and georgia
he has been published several times and last year he won the <unk> review prize
lately dudik admits life has become a little crazy as he <unk> teaching at virginia's college of william and mary while helping create the school's first formal photography program
teaching and being <unk> involved in an academic art department is a great inspiration and motivation and it provides an incredible collaborative community dudik said
and i'm very thankful for that
during the interview with <unk> kelly evans paul <unk> <unk> evans and at one point motions for her to be quiet with a finger to his lips
he also <unk> her for a <unk> interview that he says got no useful information because you were <unk> and you started out with so many <unk> that were incorrect
paul who is an <unk> also asserts that he's heard of cases where vaccines have caused profound mental disorders
i've heard of many tragic cases of walking talking normal children who wound up with profound mental disorders after vaccines paul said
i'm not arguing vaccines are a bad idea
i think they're a good thing
but i think the parents should have some input
asked for evidence of those claims paul campaign spokesman sergio <unk> didn't address them and instead said that while paul largely supports vaccines many should be voluntary
related
chris christie <unk> vaccine science
dr. paul believes that vaccines have saved lives and should be administered to children
his children were all vaccinated
he also believes many vaccines should be voluntary and like most medical decisions between the doctor and the patient not the government he wrote in an email to cnn
on tuesday paul further clarified his stance saying he didn't say vaccines caused disorders
i did not say vaccines caused disorders just that they were <unk> related i did not allege causation
i support vaccines i receive them myself and i had all of my children vaccinated paul said in a statement
in fact today i received the booster shot for the vaccines i got when i went to guatemala last year
the flap however suggests that paul is still struggling with many of the same issues that have caused gop operatives to view his likely presidential bid with some skepticism
his staff has long been aware of a perception that he's thin skinned when met with criticism and while his pointed responses are typically delivered with clear intent as with when he attacked new jersey gov
chris christie as the king of bacon they could complicate his personal appeal to voters especially if he's pitted against a female candidate

and though paul has largely avoided such controversial topics in his effort to become more attractive to mainstream republicans they're nothing new for him and his father
former rep. ron paul said during his presidential run that people have had some very very serious reactions from vaccines and paul is a member of a physicians group that <unk> the belief that vaccines can cause autism
paul will be asked to answer for those past comments and any future comments he makes that are outside the mainstream
former rep. michele bachmann may serve as a cautionary tale
she faced a firestorm of criticism for similar comments concerning the alleged negative impacts of vaccines during her two thousand and twelve presidential run
her suggestion that vaccines can put little <unk> lives at risk during a debate contributed to growing skepticism surrounding her campaign and an ultimately damning perception of her as too far outside the mainstream to represent the party
but neither the general public nor the media seem to appreciate just how much work goes into an <unk> character based dance such as the one left shark performed last night and how easy it is if you are committed to your craft to lose yourself in the moment
allow me to <unk> you
as a former <unk> <unk> trained at the school of the boston ballet i can assure you that left shark if he is the student of dance i suspect him to be trained for months to get inside the head of his character
literally
who is left shark
he probably asked himself
and why must he dance
what is his relationship to right shark
are they lovers
enemies
do they share custody of a boy shark who's starting to ask questions about his parents separation for example
this is what true dancers or <unk> do
as patrick <unk> character said in dirty dancing the steps aren't enough
feel the music
i speak from experience
at twelve i played a mouse in the <unk> and for months i studied the abrupt movements barely <unk> to the human eye of other house mice
what moved them
what was their raison <unk>
by the end of my character study i had become that mouse
it took nearly a year for me to drop character afterward
at thirteen i played arabian coffee in the <unk>
believe me getting inside the head of an exotic hot beverage would test even lee <unk> imagination
i decided to play it complex
<unk> but also <unk>
i wrote in a storyline about an elephant and a prince that only i knew about but i assure you it deeply enriched the character
but by far the most challenging role i was ever tasked with undertaking was that of a <unk> or an invisible being of the air in a ballet called les <unk>
the ballet is non narrative
there is no plot
my <unk> motivation was therefore mine to create
i imagined her a <unk> ukrainian runaway who came to america and discovered the simple <unk> of <unk> sun and the <unk>
she would return to her homeland one day but not before she got her bachelor's degree and some much needed dental work
externally she was sweet and vulnerable but inside she was tough as nails
the part was only four measures long but i made the most of it
the point is no detail is too small or insignificant
and this likely explains why to the untrained eye it seems like left shark was off his mark or forgot the choreography
he wasn't drunk
he wasn't overwhelmed by the lights and the crowd and the music
nor as some have claimed was he unable to see out of the costume
this wouldn't stop an <unk>
i submit that left shark was so <unk> in his character that he felt moved to <unk> in the moment
maybe he envisioned a shifting tide or prey in the distance
maybe he <unk> a shipwreck or sensed danger lurking behind the palm tree
perhaps beach ball had given him the <unk> eye
whatever it was i'm sure it was intentional
i can recognize a method dancer when i see one
so leave left shark alone
he is <unk> and artistic and i for one look forward to seeing him stretch and grow
sadly of right shark i can not say the same

at the extreme environments lab elite sailors are quite literally thrown in the deep end undergoing harrowing survival training in a pool as close to the southern ocean as you'll find under one roof
i think for quite a lot of them it's all a bit of a game to start with they're all jumping in the pool and having a bit of a laugh said <unk> <unk> who runs the three day advanced sea survival course at south <unk> college in newcastle
then we turn the waves on
then we turn the rain on and it's pretty severe you can't really breathe properly with it hitting your face
then we turn the wind on and all of a sudden it's not quite like going to your local swimming pool anymore
then it was my turn to join the twenty four sailors in the pool who were training ahead of one of the most brutal sporting competitions on the planet the volvo ocean race
wearing survival suits we're standing around what looks like an <unk> industrial version of your local swimming pool
a <unk> starts some unseen machinery strains somewhere deep below the waters start to move and as the air fills with spray from the overly aggressive rain makers the wind machines kick in
one by one we jump in
but it's fine because it's a swimming pool
very quickly though it's not ok i'm searching for the features on my <unk> someone's yelling something but there's too much noise
i'm struggling to fit the spray hood struggling to stay safe struggling to breathe
the sea safety course is a thorough demonstration of what to expect on the open waters teaching us how to swim in waves and spray and right <unk> life rafts
and yet it was still not a patch on what the real ocean could be
even for these professional sailors about to set off around the planet this course made them stop and think
it made them prioritize their safety and practice survival techniques as they would any other sailing maneuver
it made them stop assuming somebody else had it covered
most of the course was spent <unk> ourselves with the safety kit onboard discussing the what <unk> and doing the right thing in the right order
did i check my <unk>
do i actually know how it works
is my personal emergency position indicating radio beacon in my pocket
do i always wear that jacket
is it registered correctly
is it up to date
do i know where the life raft is and what it even looks like when it's inflated
what's in our life raft and do i know how to use it
any complacency i may have had left was thoroughly <unk> by a morning spent with professor mike <unk> a leading authority in environmental physiology at the department of sport and exercise science at <unk> university
with the cool clarity of a man that really knows his field <unk> told me that although hypothermia is often assumed the greatest danger sixty percents of deaths in cold water happen within the first few minutes of immersion
amazingly sixty percents of those deaths will happen within ten feet of a safe refuge and sixty six percents of those who die will be classified as good <unk>
as <unk> lowered me into the cool pool he told me that after ten minutes my <unk> would be radically reduced and all but my core would be dangerously cold
as the water went down the neck of my jacket not even over my head i went into cold water shock
even in a very controlled environment i was struggling
i learned though that the shock passes you just need to ride it out limit the damage and keep your airway clear of water knowing that could save your life
i'd been in and out of the pool for about an hour but dry and warm with a cup of tea i thought back to some of the harrowing stories of survival from sailors i'd interviewed
these are stories that weren't set in a swimming pool they're stories that took place in the harsh and frightening reality where there is no side there is no ladder there is no switch to turn the mayhem off
indeed i'd listened for an hour on the magnificent heads that guard sydney harbor gripped by the harrowing account of john <unk> <unk> survival of the one thousand nine hundred and ninety eight sydney to <unk> race
with composure and clarity john recalled the day a terrific storm ripped through the boxing day fleet and left him fighting injured and afraid in a decimated life raft
it was a day that his love of sailing turned into his own very precarious battle for survival and tragically it was a battle that more than one of his crew mates would lose
i walked away from my interview with john in almost stunned silence
it had been a harrowing tale to tell it had been a privilege to listen to him
and as the year progressed that stunned silence was to be repeated again and again
but what if i'm not the one in the water but doing the <unk>
like <unk> sailor <unk> <unk> account of the moment his co <unk> was thrown from the bow of their race yacht
as the spray dispersed he <unk> sideways to see british sailor sam <unk> drift away from the speeding yacht
they made eye contact racing forgotten taken over in an instant by the battle to save <unk> life
when i asked coleman how long he would have searched for his sailing partner his answer was forever
he could not face a life without finding him
after thirty five minutes some impressive <unk> and a bit of luck coleman saw his partner and saved his life
could i have done the same
i wondered
at least after my survival training session i'm more likely to know the answer than ever before
police said officers working security at a downtown phoenix hotel were contacted around two thirty a.m. by a woman who alleged that an argument over money in a guest room turned physical spilling out into the hallway she was one of two women acting as <unk> according to a news release from phoenix police
during the investigation detectives were able to establish that act of prostitution occurred in the room by at least one of the females phoenix police spokesman trent crump said in the news release
<unk> forty two was booked on charges of soliciting a <unk> and two counts of assault both misdemeanor offenses
when he was questioned by police <unk> admitted involvement in the act of prostitution but denied <unk> the females crump said
minor injuries consistent with a struggle were observed by investigators on both females
<unk> made an initial court appearance monday afternoon and was released on his own <unk>
his next court appearance was set for february twenty three
<unk> who was the twelve th overall draft pick in one thousand nine hundred and ninety five by the tampa bay <unk> was known as a <unk> defensive tackle and was the stalwart on a defense that earned the <unk> their first super bowl in two thousand and two
over his career he earned seven trips to the pro bowl and was voted into the nfl hall of fame in two thousand and thirteen
shortly after news of <unk> arrest broke the nfl network said <unk> had been fired
he worked for the network as an analyst since two thousand and eight
warren <unk> contract has been terminated and he no longer works for nfl network said a statement from alex <unk> vice president communications for the nfl network
the <unk> museum in cambridge says that the bronze sculptures known as the <unk> <unk> and dating from the one thousand five hundred s were probably created just after the famed <unk> david and just before he painted the ceiling of the <unk> <unk> chapel
the museum and researchers at the university of cambridge say they have compelling evidence that the works attributed to a dutch <unk> are actually from <unk>
if so they are the only surviving <unk> <unk> in the world says the museum
the key clue that the <unk> <unk> were actually done by <unk> came from one of the master's <unk>
last year paul <unk> a cambridge art history professor noted that a <unk> student had made a study of several <unk> sketches for works believed lost
one of the drawings in the study which dates from one thousand five hundred and eight matched one of the <unk>
further research indicated they were in <unk> style and x rays roughly confirmed the era of their creation
even a <unk> <unk> is visible as is the <unk> arch of the foot wrote university of <unk> <unk> peter <unk> according to the uk guardian
victoria <unk> keeper of applied arts at the <unk> museum described the project to the guardian as a renaissance <unk>
she says that the museum was careful in assembling the evidence and that the works are <unk>
the modeling is superb they are so powerful and so compelling so whoever made them had to be superb she said
the works and some of the evidence will be on display at the <unk> from tuesday through august nine
though the museum is confident of the works origins research is continuing and results will be presented at a conference in early july
brown twenty one was placed in a medically induced coma and the status of her brain function won't be known until the <unk> are reduced the source told cnn
bobbi kristina is fighting for her life and is surrounded by immediate family
as her father already stated we are asking you to honor our request for privacy during this difficult time the houston family said thanking her supporters
the source close to the family told cnn legal analyst sunny <unk> that brown's eyes opened and closed a few times monday but that doctors told family members not to read too much into that movement
doctors were trying to reduce the <unk> to check brown's brain function but decided not to and to keep her in the coma for now the source said
the source added that brown had some seizures on monday
bobbi kristina in her own words
she was not breathing when a man identified as her husband found her saturday morning inside her <unk> in the atlanta suburb
he called nine hundred and eleven and performed cpr until emergency crews arrived and took over said police spokeswoman lisa holland
the spokeswoman said when brown was found she was unresponsive meaning not breathing no heartbeat
in scanner traffic emergency services could be heard describing an echo level response urgent and life threatening with possible cardiac arrest
brown was taken to a local hospital where she is still alive and breathing
other than that i don't know her condition holland said over the weekend
a source close to the family told cnn contributor <unk> turner on monday that brown is in really bad shape
everyone is hoping for the best preparing for the worst and praying for a miracle the source said
nobody knows what caused brown's <unk> holland said but police consider it a medical incident at this time
she said investigators had found nothing to indicate it was drug or alcohol related
the incident report referenced a drowning
police had been to bobbi kristina brown's residence recently
somebody reported a fight there january twenty three but nobody answered the door and officers found no evidence of an altercation holland said
almost three years ago whitney houston was found dead in a bathtub at the beverly hilton hotel near los angeles hours before she was to attend a pre grammy awards party
a coroner ruled her february eleven two thousand and twelve death an accidental drowning with heart disease and cocaine use listed as contributing factors
brown is her only child
she encourages me and inspires me houston once said of her daughter
when i look at her eyes and i see myself i go ok
i can do this
i can do this
brown was born in one thousand nine hundred and ninety three during houston's marriage to randb singer bobby brown which ended in divorce in two thousand and seven
the daughter of music royalty became a public figure during the mid two thousand s reality show being bobby brown in which she frequently appeared alongside her parents and often had a front row seat to their marital fireworks
bobby brown requested privacy in a statement issued sunday by his lawyer who said that brown was at the hospital with his daughter
please allow for my family to deal with this matter and give my daughter the love and support she needs at this time bobby brown said
mother and daughter performed together on national tv in two thousand and nine when the two sang my love is your love in central park on abc's good morning america
given the <unk> close relationship it's no surprise that houston's death was a major blow
days after her mother's body was found a grieving bobbi kristina then eighteen was taken to <unk> sinai medical center because she was overwhelmed family friend kim <unk> said
she loves hard <unk> said then of bobbi kristina
she's going to be ok and we're going to see to it
after houston's death bobbi kristina talked of pursuing a career in acting and music just like her mother
in two thousand and twelve she reportedly lobbied for a role in a planned biopic of her mother's life
<unk> whitney which was directed by actress angela bassett debuted in january two thousand and fifteen but the houston family was not involved
brown did make her acting debut in two thousand and twelve on tyler perry's <unk> show for better or worse
her performance in the small role won praise from perry
she did a fantastic job he said at the time
and that kid has a such a future
she's such an actor
even before her famous mother's death videos of brown singing surfaced on you tube and were quickly criticized by fans who felt her talent did not live up to houston's
concerns that she may have substance abuse issues as her mother did intensified in july two thousand and fourteen after a picture was posted on her instagram account showing a young woman who looked like brown appearing to be smoking from a bong
the caption read
this picture may be inappropriate but i want to make a connection with you all
don't worry this picture isn't recent just hear me out
do you know what i feel
i feel strange i can't feel any pain anymore
i don't take any drugs as of recently
things just happened
but then there is some situation that force me to do things and the impact i'll feel pain
i did and i do
i was hurt
brown later denied that she posted the photo and tweeted that it was done by someone attempting to <unk> her image
brown appeared on episodes of <unk> brief reality show the <unk>
on our own which followed her life after houston's death
one of the show's <unk> revolved around brown's relationship with nick gordon who had lived with houston and her daughter since he was twelve years old
brown reportedly got engaged to gordon and in january two thousand and fourteen she tweeted out a picture of wedding rings presumably belonging to her and gordon along with the words <unk> <unk>
made me promise several times to look after <unk>
and mom i will never ever ever break that promise gordon told the entertainment show extra afterward saying houston just treated me like she gave birth to me
it was unclear whether gordon came home saturday morning to find brown in the bathtub or if he had been in another part of the house overnight holland said
police have obtained a search warrant to look through the house but that's standard procedure she said
concern for brown surged again after news broke
music director michael <unk> sent along healing energy to the daughter of a late great friend
<unk> diane warren tweeted i hope bobbi kristina gets the help she needs
poor thing warren wrote
almost three <unk> to the day her mom passed and the same thing almost happened to her
parents
what is your message to parents who don't vaccinate their kids
share your video or written perspective on cnn ireport
but there are many who choose for their own reasons to disregard the recommendations to vaccinate and exercise their right to not do so
the controversy then comes when the anti vaccination movement gets large enough to reverse advances in the reduction or elimination of certain diseases
that's what is happening with the measles
how bad can it be
here are some <unk> to the issue in context
in simplest terms as of january thirty there were one hundred and two cases of measles reported across fourteen states
the majority of these cases are related to one outbreak linked to disneyland in california
last year there were six hundred and forty four cases of measles reported
this year's pace is striking
one month into the new year the number of measles cases is nearly one sixth of last year's total
a closer look makes this year's measles outbreak look even worse
last year's six hundred and forty four measles cases is an <unk> compared to the previous decade
the number of measles cases in two thousand and fourteen was the highest since two thousand
between two thousand and one and two thousand and eleven the median number of measles cases reported per year was sixty two
here's the glass half empty view
so far this year there are already more cases of measles than during an entire typical year
those are the words of dr. anne schuchat assistant surgeon general and director of the centers for disease control and prevention's national center for immunization and respiratory diseases
no this is not the first time the united states has witnessed an uptick in measles cases since the invention of the measles vaccine
a brief history of measles in the united states according to the cdc
before the introduction of a live measles vaccine in one thousand nine hundred and sixty three the average yearly number of measles cases was five hundred and forty nine <unk>
once the measles vaccine was introduced there was a huge drop in measles cases
then between one thousand nine hundred and eighty nine and one thousand nine hundred and ninety one there was a resurgence in measles cases
there were fifty five thousand cases and one hundred and twenty three deaths reported during that period
those getting sick were mostly unvaccinated children
but there were also people who had the vaccine and were getting the disease anyway
in one thousand nine hundred and eighty nine the medical community's recommendation was updated to recommend a two dose vaccination regimen
the use of two doses was effective
in two thousand endemic measles was declared eliminated from the united states
it is a pretty big deal that the united states can say it eliminated measles
this doesn't mean that measles doesn't exist here but that there is not a constant presence of it in an area
there is the risk that measles could re establish itself in the united states
schuchat the assistant surgeon general told reporters the spike in measles cases is troubling
this worries me and i want to do everything possible to prevent measles from getting a foothold in the united states and becoming endemic again she said
the cdc points out that people who refuse to vaccinate usually live in the same community
when measles finds its way into these communities outbreaks are more likely to occur and controlling the disease becomes harder
measles is not a virus that americans typically spend time worrying about because for a long time it has not been prevalent
but it is a serious disease
it is a highly communicable respiratory disease caused by a virus and spread through the air
this is not a problem with the measles vaccine not working schuchat said
this is a problem of the measles vaccine not being used
the research on the effectiveness of the measles vaccine is well documented
but anecdotes have a powerful sway
the anti vaccination crowd got a boost when a british study alleged a link between autism and childhood vaccines
the study was later retracted and called an elaborate fraud by a leading medical publication
nonetheless personal stories of people who claim that vaccines are responsible for autism or other conditions in children find an audience among well meaning parents
one arizona cardiologist dr. jack <unk> has become a face of the anti vaccination movement because he is a doctor who refuses to vaccinate his children
it's not my responsibility to inject my child with chemicals <unk> told cnn's erin burnett
the bottom line of course is that no matter what the recommendations are no person or institution can force people to vaccinate their children
schools and other institutions often have immunization requirements but there are ways to opt out for religious or personal reasons
during the last school year three point three percents of california <unk> about eighteen thousand two hundred were allowed to skip vaccinations according to the cdc
the vast majority of exemptions were due to personal beliefs
journalists at silk a platform for creating data <unk> took california kindergarten vaccination rate data and found one hundred and thirty three school districts with vaccination compliance rates at eighty percents or lower
scientifically there is no debate
the measles vaccine is effective
most of those who contract measles unsurprisingly are those who are unvaccinated
but a conversation about the current measles outbreak brings up other ideas on personal and religious freedoms skepticism of scientific findings reach of government regulations that are inherently political
and here is where the arguments arise
some potential republican presidential contenders have said that vaccinating children should be voluntary though they walked a fine line
kentucky sen. rand paul told radio host laura ingraham that he is not anti vaccine at all but added most of them should be voluntary
new jersey gov
chris christie said he <unk> his children to protect their health and the public health but that he understands that parents need to have some measure of choice as well
the science is clear
which policies to craft with that knowledge is what remains to be discussed
in a room packed with illuminated <unk> and <unk> decorated books of hours it would be easy to ignore the four <unk> sheets arranged in a cabinet along the wall were it not for the two magic words
magna carta
for the first time in their eight hundred year history the four surviving original versions of the magna carta have been brought together at the british library in london in an operation planned with military precision
it's pretty high security admits june osborne dean of <unk> cathedral
its copy of the charter has left home for the first time in decades to join its siblings in the exhibition
we had <unk> all around it to make sure that in the transfer nothing threatened the document
but as in all of these matters of security the greatest advantage is secrecy she adds with a smile refusing to go into detail about how or when the priceless page was brought to the capital
i can tell you that as dean i did not know when it moved
we have taken it really seriously
it's all a far cry from the days when one of the <unk> previous <unk> used to hide it under her bed for safe keeping
the <unk> <unk> felt very deeply about her responsibility for looking after it
the story goes that she occasionally put it under her bed at home and in order to get it under her bed she put it on the basket of her bicycle says osborne
i <unk> to think that anybody could have thought that was the right thing to do but
<unk> probably thought she was doing her best
by contrast lincoln <unk> well traveled version of the charter which has just returned from a visit to the united states is no stranger to such serious levels of surveillance having spent several years under lock key and armed guard in fort <unk>
in one thousand nine hundred and thirty nine when the war broke out it was at the world's fair in new york explains philip <unk> dean of lincoln cathedral
it couldn't travel back across the atlantic and so the american people took it in
it was kept at the library of congress for several years but when the u.s. entered the war it was not safe in washington d.c. and so it went into fort <unk> and there it was held with all of the other great treasures of america and the <unk> obviously until one thousand nine hundred and forty six
today the magna carta is revered around the world as the document that established the principle that everyone including the king himself was subject to the rule of law
that key clause nestled among long forgotten details about fishing rights and noble <unk> <unk> has become a central tenet of democracies across the globe from the u.s. whose constitution and bill of rights were directly influenced by the magna carta to australia new zealand and india
it really is an iconic document one of the most famous documents in the world says claire <unk> head of medieval manuscripts at the british library
it has become such a powerful symbol over the centuries for all sorts of rights and freedoms
but back in one thousand two hundred and fifteen it was effectively a peace treaty
it was a practical solution to the political crisis the country was in at the time explains <unk> a way of bringing to an end a long running conflict between king john and his <unk>
and although the monarch signed it under <unk> he soon changed his mind and had it <unk> by the pope
it wasn't until his <unk> revived the magna carta in the years after his death that it began to take on such importance
nowadays it is studied in schools from seattle to sydney
more than forty three thousand people from all over the world applied for tickets to the exhibition
just one thousand two hundred and fifteen of them will get the chance to see the quartet of <unk> over the next three days
academics and magna carta experts will also get a unique chance to study the four documents side by side looking at differences in text handwriting and condition for clues to their past
it's a great opportunity for all four to be looked at to be compared and contrasted said chris woods director of the national conservation service
there's a great deal we still don't know about each of their individual <unk> but there are things we can learn about them particularly by comparing them
julian <unk> curator of medieval manuscripts at the british library says it is a miracle the documents have survived one was badly damaged in a fire in the eighteen th century and the other was <unk> found in a london <unk> shop in the seventeen th century that's a bit frightening because what was it doing there
presumably it was going to be cut up to be used to make <unk> <unk>
once the landmark display comes to an end the visiting versions will be sent home to <unk> and lincoln where they like the two held permanently by the british library will star in individual <unk> marking the eight hundred th anniversary of the charter attracting thousands more visitors on a pilgrimage to see their own piece of history
it has become a <unk> in the best sense of the word in that it represents a whole tradition says justin champion professor of history at the university of <unk>
it is a bit of a disappointment when you first see it
it's a <unk> brown <unk> but he insists it is much more than that
the magna carta has become not just an artifact but an idea and as we know ideas are much more dangerous than things
the new chairman of the house oversight committee republican jason chaffetz told cnn he will probably haul the commissioner in front of his panel to justify the league's non profit status
in an interview the morning after super bowl xlix chaffetz asked was that a nonprofit event going on or was that a for profit venture
it's a for profit venture
you tell people that the nfl is a nonprofit entity and they just start laughing and <unk>
but it's not fair
if there's another side to that then let the commissioner come in and make that case
chaffetz said he thinks the league which paid goodell forty four million dollar in two thousand and twelve should have to pay taxes a bill that adds up to more than one hundred million dollar over a decade
back decades ago before there was really a thriving sports league out there they got this carve out
but it seems to me that ought to be one of the things we get rid of he said
the president has said he wants to get rid of these special carve outs
well here's one that i think we should get rid of
the nfl has said that only the league office which pays the commissioner is tax exempt arguing that it pays taxes on income generating areas such as television rights game tickets and <unk>
chaffetz balked at the idea of investigating the kind of off the field violence that has brought the nfl scrutiny and bad headlines such as <unk> running back ray rice knocking his future wife unconscious and former patriots star aaron hernandez's murder trial
i look at the landscape of the problems that we have in this nation and the nfl is going to have to sort that out
and the fans are going to have to push them that direction
that spotlight is pretty bright on them right now he said
i don't know that we would add additional light to that
all the problems we've got going on we've got a lot of other things we need to solve
the four remaining copies of the one thousand two hundred and fifteen magna carta which established the principle that no one including the king should be above the law have been united at the british library in london for the first time to mark the <unk> eight hundred th anniversary
this assistance would come in the form of so called defensive lethal aid which could include anti tank anti air and anti mortar systems
the new york times first reported the possible change in policy saying nato commander gen. phil <unk> is in support of the new lethal assistance and that secretary of state john kerry chairman of the joint chiefs gen. martin dempsey and national security adviser susan rice are all open to considering the idea
a u.s. official now tells cnn that military leadership supports defensive lethal aid being part of the discussion but the administration is still trying to assess what reaction it could <unk> from the russian government which the u.s. maintains is backing rebels in eastern ukraine
in an interview last week with cnn's fareed zakaria president barack obama alluded to concern in the international community that president vladimir putin is further isolating russia and bypassing opportunities to de escalate the conflict
what is absolutely true is that if you have a leader who continually drives past the off ramps that we've provided given the size of the russian military given the fact that ukraine is not a nato country and so as a consequence there are clear limits in terms of what we would do militarily you know mr. putin has not been stopped so far obama said
the u.s. official who spoke with cnn said the arms option came back to the forefront following russian advances and weapons shipments into ukraine in recent weeks
but the u.s. military leadership feels any arms shipments to ukraine must be part of a broader package of options
ben rhodes obama's deputy national security adviser said on monday that sending lethal aid to ukraine isn't a solution to the escalating situation there
we don't think the answer to the crisis in ukraine is simply to inject more weapons and get into that type of <unk> for <unk> with russia rhodes said on cnn's the situation room
we think the answer is to apply pressure try to get them to the table with the separatists so we can see a peaceful de escalation rhodes continued adding that obama and german chancellor angela merkel would likely discuss ukraine when they meet at the white house next week
in his cnn interview obama <unk> away from the possibility of lethal aid calling instead for a continuation of economic sanctions
to those who would suggest that we need to do more what i've said to them is that we can exact higher and higher costs and that's exactly what we're doing and we can bring diplomatic pressure to bear obama said adding i don't think that it would be wise for the united states or the world to see an actual military conflict between the united states and russia
but in a press conference in india the president seemed to leave the door open to some kinds of defensive lethal aid saying i will look at all additional options that are available to us short of a military confrontation in trying to address this issue
on monday a group of former u.s. and nato officials released a report in which they called on the obama administration to provide further support to the ukrainian government warning that failure to stop incursions in ukraine could <unk> russia
if the united states and nato do not adequately support ukraine moscow may well conclude that the kinds of tactics it has employed over the past year can be applied elsewhere the authors said specifically highlighting concerns for regional nato allies estonia and <unk>
the report specifically calls on the u.s. to provide light anti armor missiles as well as non lethal equipment such as armored <unk> and uavs
some in the west are concerned that provision of military assistance particularly of lethal arms would cause russia to escalate the crisis the report concedes
we vehemently disagree
the authors cite actions the russian government has already taken to escalate the crisis including the seizure of crimea and their arming of rebel groups
enhanced military assistance would increase <unk> capability to deter further russian escalation they add
among the report's authors are michele flournoy a former undersecretary of defense in the obama administration and <unk> <unk> a former foreign policy adviser to the president and u.s
permanent representative to nato
big data and evidence based policy are the dominant ideas of our moment
a may two thousand and fourteen white house report put it this way
big data will become an historic driver of progress helping our nation <unk> the civic and economic <unk> that has long been its <unk>
the white house report presents big data as an <unk> powerful set of techniques
it says the social and economic value created by big data should be balanced against privacy and other core values of fairness equity and autonomy
but the white house effort to balance the costs and benefits of big data misses the bigger picture
there are limits to the <unk> power of big data and <unk> that <unk> big <unk> capacity to drive progress
data driven techniques are only one part of how government industry and civil society should make important decisions
bad use of data can be worse than no data at all
as a december two thousand and fourteen new york times magazine story about marissa mayer yahoo's chief executive pointed out
mayer also favored a system of quarterly performance reviews or <unk> that required every yahoo employee on every team be ranked from one to five
the system was meant to encourage hard work and weed out <unk> but it soon produced the exact opposite
because only so many four s and five s could be allotted talented people no longer wanted to work together
strategic goals were sacrificed as employees did not want to change projects and leave themselves open to a lower score
as the yahoo example shows the presumption that quantitative techniques <unk> assess what works is deeply flawed
many attempts to collect and interpret data not only miss key factors but transform for the worse the systems they claim only to be measuring
<unk> <unk> a fourth grade teacher on long island sued the new york state education department in october two thousand and fourteen in what is perhaps the clearest legal test case of the dangers of big data
<unk> is highly regarded by her peers and <unk> an exceptional <unk> in the words of her school district's superintendent
yet a statistical technique called value added modeling that <unk> to evaluate teachers based on students standardized test scores said <unk> was ineffective
the american statistical association has criticized value added modeling as an ineffective measure
ranking teachers by their <unk> scores can have unintended consequences that reduce quality the <unk> said
despite the skepticism of <unk> the experts best aware of the weaknesses of the tools they created bureaucrats at the state department of education have embraced the use of value added modeling
<unk> appears to be just one individual among the many who are being hurt by the vogue for data
the impulse to overuse data is not unique to educational bureaucrats
<unk> <unk> bureaucratic power and gives <unk> importance to short term effects because they are easier to measure
it is not a question of balancing the power of big data against its dangers but of recognizing the <unk> limitations of that power
the central claim of data proponents is that data always has some positive value
this premise is false
data gathering that seems innocuous enough to the <unk> class often brings with it undue burden on the subjects of the data gathering
take reports attributed to amazon customer service representatives about how each moment of their workday is monitored and measured or similar practices recalled by people who said they had been target employees
in both instances the decentralized human processes in which <unk> evaluate their <unk> have been replaced by centralized quantitative <unk>
this shift has been taking place across retail customer service and food preparation sectors which together account for over twenty percents of america's workforce
as a result in the words of a person reported by gawker to have been a manager at target of course we <unk> as the saying went if you weren't cheating you weren't trying
according to the former <unk> statement <unk> corporate management was trying to increase customer satisfaction by measuring customer satisfaction scores which employees <unk>
if those compiling the data cheat the data won't be useful to the central office
the burden of compiling data causes retail employees who previously had some professional autonomy to feel constantly under centralized surveillance
data is far more subject to manipulation than its proponents realize
even the two thousand and eleven <unk> global institute report that popularized the term big data acknowledged that its central claim that we are on the <unk> of a tremendous wave of innovation productivity and growth
all driven by big data was <unk>
as of now <unk> admitted there is no empirical evidence of a link between data intensity
and productivity in specific sectors
in the intervening years such evidence remains scant even as the <unk> <unk> has gathered steam
college rankings and federal sentencing guidelines for example are both <unk> of complex social systems that are broadly agreed to have harmed the systems they set out to <unk> and order
many important questions are simply not <unk> to quantitative analysis and never will be
where should my child go to college or when
how should we punish criminals
are charter schools a good idea
should we fund the human genome project or basic science in general
should we have <unk>
taking quantitative answers to these questions seriously not only risks getting the answer wrong but shapes the underlying reality in ways that are detrimental to our collective well being
such questions call for informed judgment that balances values incentives context and other factors
it is often difficult to find <unk> individuals who can balance these factors and be trusted
that difficulty is inherent in all social systems
settling vital questions on the basis of informed judgment only appears to be more subjective than using quantitative techniques
by laundering their biases and <unk> into the methodology they use to devise quantitative <unk> policymakers and social scientists can fool themselves and others into believing they are impartial and <unk>
to take another example <unk> the worth of the human genome project ought to depend on one's view of the value of the knowledge derived from it within the domain of biology and medicine
in his two thousand and thirteen state of the union address barack obama claimed every dollar we invested to map the human genome returned one hundred and forty dollar to our economy
such claims are as irrelevant as debating whether the parthenon was cost effective
there is simply no useful way to assess the long term economic impact of either the human genome project or of the parthenon and to do so is to miss the point
<unk> didn't build the parthenon to draw tourists to downtown athens two thousand five hundred years later
the fact that it is now a tourist attraction does little to explain its value
similarly investments in understanding the human genetic code will be realized over time and can not be justified in terms of their short term economic impact
to focus on the many <unk> flaws in the return on investment techniques used by the <unk> memorial institute in the study obama was referring to is to miss the point
obama proclaimed the precise <unk> return as a <unk> which <unk> the money spent
but the strong case for the human genome project rests on the knowledge it created rather than the economic benefit which can not be meaningfully measured
the effect of new basic scientific knowledge on the structure of the economy is too diffuse and complex for economists to measure
we have no access to a <unk> world in which the human genome project did not exist
of course the fact that quantitative studies of social and economic systems were systematically flawed in the recent past is no proof that future investigations will suffer from the same shortcomings
however it is reasonable to believe that if the same basic methodology is used even if more data is gathered these flaws will persist
the only way to understand the fact of the matter about whether butter is good or bad for you is to actually understand what happens when you eat butter not to continue to try to tease out more intricate statistical <unk> between health indicators and butter consumption
in the late one thousand nine hundred and eighty s spurred by the publication of james <unk> best selling book chaos
making a new science there was a wave of popular attention paid to the then nascent discipline of chaos theory
<unk> introduced the public to the idea that many real world systems exhibit sensitive dependence on initial conditions
change the <unk> slightly and radically different <unk> will emerge
it is impossible to pinpoint with certainty just what causes say a hurricane to form
human social systems public primary and secondary schools universities or the criminal justice system are complex systems just like the weather
the vogue of attention to chaos theory passed before policymakers came to take it seriously
understanding the complexity of social systems means understanding that conclusive answers to causal questions in social systems will always remain elusive
gathering more data twice as much ten times as much a hundred times as much won't change this
to effectively debate public policy or corporate strategy we will have to continue to have debates over principles
in such debates disagreement among individuals with different ideological <unk> will continue
to believe that <unk> rigorous quantitative judgment can be systematically <unk> for such debate <unk> programs and practices whose costs are direct but whose benefits are indirect and thus more difficult to measure
ease of measurement does not <unk> with importance
the administrative apparatus of evidence generation does not as it claims to merely pursue good policy but is itself a self interested actor pursuing particular political ends
a december two thousand and fourteen book published by the brookings institution show me the evidence
obama's fight for <unk> and results in social policy sums up this belief
the vision of the evidence based movement is that the nation will have thousands of evidence based social programs that address each of the nation's most important social problems and that under the onslaught of these increasingly effective programs the nation's social problems will at last recede
this <unk> vision of evidence as <unk> is dangerous and damaging
unless the <unk> of evidence are resisted they will <unk> over what they can not measure leaving us poorer as individuals and as a society buried in a bureaucracy of numbers <unk> from reality

transfer deadline day marks the end of the period in which clubs are allowed to sign players meaning that once the window slams shut at eleven pm gmt no further business can be done
there are two windows in each year one beginning on july one and ending on august thirty one and the other starting on january one and finishing on the final day of the month unless that day falls on the weekend as it does on this occasion
while most of the business is done during the month long period the <unk> nature of deadline day means some clubs are left waiting until the final minutes to get their deals done leading to masses of excitement cynicism and often disappointment from fans across social media
supporters stay up late in front of the television awaiting the very latest news from their respective clubs with hopes for a last minute superstar signing becoming increasingly desperate
but this year's deadline day has been one of the <unk> in recent years
last season's january transfer window was noticeable for several big deals including juan <unk> fifty six million dollar move from chelsea to manchester
chelsea spent thirty two million dollar on midfielder <unk> <unk> on top of bringing in kurt <unk> and mohamed <unk>
but heading into the final day of the transfer window period the gross spending of the twenty premier league clubs stood at eighty m
manchester city's signing of wilfried bony from swansea for a fee reported to be in the region of thirty eight million dollar is the biggest of the transfer window in england so far
arsenal spent around seventeen dollar m on gabriel <unk> the brazilian defender from <unk> while leicester <unk> up thirteen dollar <unk> m for croatia forward <unk> <unk>
while the summer window saw a record level of transfer spending so far we have seen spending in january being slightly more reserved said dan jones partner in the sports business group at <unk>
however two thousand and fourteen fifteen is still a record season for premier league spending with clubs having spent over nine hundred m significantly ahead of the previous record of seven hundred and sixty m
this level of spending has been made possible in large part through the broadcast revenue premier league clubs enjoy
with all twenty premier league clubs now ranked in the top forty globally by revenue we continue to see them use their increased resources to invest in playing talent in the january window
in england the clubs facing <unk> from the world's richest league have been reluctant to throw money at the problem in a bid to ensure survival
there have been a number of loan deals completed but actual transfers are in scarce supply
i think the surprising thing is that it's quiet at the lower end of the table <unk> <unk> <unk> former monaco chief executive and norwegian football scout told cnn
it's so tight down there and it's the last opportunity to do something which can make a great difference
there's a lot of money and <unk> at stake
for the top clubs it's trickier because you don't want to buy players who can't play in european champions league
for manchester united i don't think players currently playing in the champions league would come and play for them at the moment
the window will also close hours before february three in france italy and the netherlands
in spain where the window closed on friday clubs spent seventy nine point five million dollar during the transfer window up from fifty three point seven million dollar at the same time last year
real madrid's signing of brazilian midfielder lucas silva from <unk> for a fee believed to be in the region of fourteen point five million dollar and norwegian <unk> martin odegaard took the headlines
on the trip billed as trade mission christie also criticized president barack obama's negotiating skills arguing that obama has been weak in recent talks involving iran and cuba
you need an effective negotiator at the top and as i've said before i think the president has shown over and over that he's not a good negotiator christie told reporters in cambridge england
if you see the reaction from raul castro it doesn't seem like he's saying thank you how can i make cuba freer
it seems he now wants guantanamo bay and it sounds to me like he now wants <unk> and compensation he continued addressing obama's push to ease the cuba embargo
so the president is not proving himself to be the most adept negotiator in my mind on behalf of american interests
christie is in the united kingdom for a three day swing that will offer the governor who recently launched a political committee ahead of a potential white house run a chance to polish his foreign policy credentials
later monday he meets with prime minister david cameron at ten downing street as well as u.s
ambassador matthew <unk> and members of the prime minister's cabinet
asked about vaccinations christie said he and his wife vaccinate their children but he understands that parents need to have some measure of choice as well
so that's a balance the government has to decide
christie an avid sports fan started his trip watching arsenal defeat aston villa five zero in a premiere league game
he also stayed up late to watch the super bowl game he told reporters monday morning
christie ventured across the pond a couple of days after mitt romney announced he wouldn't pursue the two thousand and sixteen republican presidential nomination a decision that opens up funding streams for christie
the two who've long described themselves as friends had dinner friday night
asked about the dinner christie according to the associated press told reporters sunday
good to see you all
the governor declined to comment further on how romney's decision affects christie's chances for two thousand and sixteen
i just arrived here a few hours ago he said
i'm not processing a lot at the moment
i've processed some soccer
that was about it
or football as they call it
his schedule on monday included a wreath laying ceremony at the cambridge american cemetery to honor u.s. military service members who died in world war ii
the itinerary this week also includes a visit to hope house a drug addiction treatment facility that's backed by members of the royal family
britain's prince harry teamed up with christie in two thousand and thirteen to tour recovery efforts after superstorm sandy severely damaged the jersey shore
unlike his trip to mexico in september and to canada in december christie is not set to deliver any major foreign policy speeches
instead he'll hold roundtable discussions and tour facilities that focus on the life sciences industry including pharmaceutical and health care organizations
the united kingdom is new jersey's third largest trade partner with more than seven billion dollar exchanged annually
either one or two suicide bombers struck outside a stadium monday in gombe nigeria after president goodluck jonathan ended a campaign rally at the site and had left officials said
police said one female bomber detonated explosives killing herself and another person
but rescuers and medical sources said both women were suspected to be suicide bombers
the number of injuries was also unclear
<unk> <unk> of the gombe police command said six people had minor injuries
rescuers and medical sources reported eighteen people injured in a blast were being treated at a hospital
the bomber was a long distance from where the rally had taken place due to security measures <unk> said
jonathan had left an hour earlier and was already out of the city when the blast occurred he added
there was no immediate claim of responsibility for the blast
gombe in northeastern nigeria is one of the sites that has faced repeated attacks blamed on the militant islamic group boko haram
the bus collided with a tree while it was traveling down a road in central london according to london transport official ken davidson
five people have been treated by the london ambulance service for minor injuries and two of them have been taken to hospital said london fire brigade station manager gary <unk>
those involved are very lucky to have escaped serious injury
<unk> used a <unk> to remove the final section of the bus roof and london's metropolitan police confirmed that all surrounding roads were closed following the accident
there will be a full investigation into this incident says davidson
the russian emergency situations ministry says one hundred and forty seven firefighters struggled for twenty five hours over the weekend to put out the blaze in the main library of the institute for research information on social sciences in moscow
the fire which ripped through the library friday evening destroyed two thousand square meters of the building and caused part of the roof to collapse according to an official statement
the russian emergency situations ministry said the fire was particularly hard to put out because of the high temperatures narrow <unk> and the risk of the building falling down
moscow's emergency ministry said the temperature inside the rubble of the library remains high and that there is still a threat that the building could collapse
vladimir <unk> president of the russian academy of sciences told the russian news agency ria <unk> that the fire which destroyed fifteen percents of all the documents in the library reminded him of the one thousand nine hundred and eighty six disaster at the chernobyl nuclear plant in ukraine
it's a major loss for science
this is the largest collection of its kind in the world probably equivalent to the library of congress <unk> told the agency
it contains material that you can't find anywhere else and all the social science institutions use this library
what has happened here is reminiscent of chernobyl
the <unk> director <unk> <unk> told tass that he fears the building can not be restored
founded in one thousand nine hundred and eighteen the library is the biggest social science research center in russia
before the fire it held around fourteen million documents in ancient and modern eastern european languages including works dating to the sixteen th century
the emergency situations ministry said it is not yet clear what started the fire but investigators are looking into whether a short circuit was to blame
a source at moscow's interior ministry told the russian news agency tass that the fire spread so quickly because it was not reported quickly enough
no one was in the building but guards at the time of the fire
a fundraising campaign to support a disabled <unk> who was a victim of a <unk> attack has raised more than three hundred thousand towards a new home
an assailant shoved alan barnes sixty seven who is just four feet six inches tall and partially blind to the ground and demanded he hand over his money in <unk> a town in the north east of england
barnes suffered a broken collar bone but his attacker left empty handed
<unk> katie cutler read about the attack on a british newspaper website and created a fundraising page via the <unk> website
she says that alan is too scared to return home and she would like to raise five hundred to help towards a new house
after reading his article on the mirror dot co dot uk i was so upset that anyone could target a disabled <unk> and be so cruel she says on the page
we can't take away what has happened but with a little donation we can make the future a <unk> one and help towards the cost of his new home
thank you all
a staggering three hundred and two thousand later and growing cutler took to twitter to express her gratitude towards the generosity of the online community
the donations were not just monetary either cutler says a man has offered to fit a new kitchen for barnes
another has pledged to <unk> his new home
<unk> police are still searching for the attacker and appealing for further information
detective constable chris neil said
this was a cowardly assault on a vulnerable man who wasn't able to defend himself
his disability means he is partially <unk> and quite short and it's <unk> that someone would target him
but the outpouring of support has left many with a restored faith in humanity and the fundraising continues
other hugely successful crowd funding campaigns include over five point four million dollar raised by stephen <unk> a teenager with incurable cancer who eventually passed away
<unk> gave the money to the teenage cancer trust the charity that supported him through his illness
i'd been asking the saudi interior ministry to take me there for several years
now i was in the desert kingdom covering king salman bin <unk> ascent to the throne and that permission had finally come through
in the past few weeks houthi rebels have taken control of yemen's capital pushing the country ever closer to failed state status and giving the al qaeda franchise there al qaeda in the arabian peninsula or aqap a greater foothold
the saudi minister of interior now second in line to the throne has a personal stake in seeing aqap eradicated
the terror group's top bomb maker put a sophisticated bomb in his own brother's <unk> exploding it when the brother met the leading royal a few years ago
the brother died the minister was only lightly injured
this is the same bomb maker who made the <unk> bomb that came close to bringing down an airliner over detroit on christmas day two thousand and nine
despite extensive drone campaigns targeting him he is believed to still be alive and remains a significant global threat
there is no doubt in anyone's mind here that al qaeda in yemen will use any chance it gets to export terror over the border to their northern neighbor with the royal family being the targets of choice
col. omar al <unk> our escort for the day was in a <unk> mood as we sped toward the looming mountains that mark the border
anything could happen he told us
be ready with your camera
gun battles are rare on this border he said but only three weeks earlier on <unk> northern frontier isis fighters broke through the defenses killing three saudi soldiers including their commander
the gun battle footage of which was posted on the internet was a <unk> reminder that the desert kingdom the west's biggest regional partner in fighting the terror groups is surrounded by battle hardened enemies
this corner of the country is remarkably green
relatively <unk> vegetation in saudi terms at least sprouts in <unk> from the semi arid fields
as our four wheel drive truck swung through the <unk> metal gate marking the edge of the border exclusion zone we got our first taste of what has mostly been a hidden war down here
a <unk> saudi village of large <unk> villas came into view
pretty until we got close when we realized the buildings were all shot up
rockets had torn <unk> holes in the walls and gardens were <unk> with <unk> <unk> of <unk> that slowly consumed the once vibrant homes
our host explained this was a village overrun by houthi rebels from yemen six years ago
in a three week battle saudi <unk> <unk> had nearly destroyed the <unk> in the battle to save it
the government moved the residents away creating a buffer between them and their <unk> neighbor
as we drive on he tells us yemen's security is worsening and saudi arabia is spending almost three billion dollar on <unk> up border security
our trucks are bumping and slipping their way up the newly cut rough rock tracks
at moments it feels as if we are almost climbing <unk>
these mountains are as rugged and rough as they are beautiful
villages cling <unk> to their higher reaches
no fence reaches up this far the tiny smattering of guards <unk> the impression that at these <unk> border control works on an honor system
no line on a map will stop these mountain men from rounding up their stray goats
even from the roadside i can see tiny <unk> <unk> the steep terrain from yemen to saudi and back
in the <unk> control is much more effective
watch towers are equipped with thermal imaging equipment super zoom cameras watching over mile upon mile and layer upon layer of razor wire
it needs to be like this
what we saw was staggering
i had no idea so many people and such a massive amount of drugs are moving over the border every day
at our first stop we saw two men captured that day
we saw another one caught soon after
then a whole <unk> about a dozen people crowded inside a mesh cage welded to a pickup truck
one of them was just eleven years old
they all told us they had come to saudi for work
the eleven year old was earning about one hundred dollar a month on a supermarket till in <unk>
all told the same story
about poverty and increasing chaos in yemen and the houthis getting stronger
the risk of jail in saudi they said was better than the certainty of poverty in yemen
our government escort told us they'd all be sent to the nearest large police station where they would be <unk> and officials would check their records to make sure none had ties to terrorism
the men and they were all men admitted that <unk> over the border is getting much harder amid the increase in guard posts and border fences
border guards told us in the past three months alone they have picked up forty two thousand people along the eight hundred kilometer border
of course we are unable to verify that figure but if the volume of illegal migrants we saw in the morning was shocking then the afternoon was mind blowing
we were taken to a room where three children were standing with <unk> of <unk> the <unk> <unk> that most <unk> <unk> every day at their feet
the youngest a ten year old told me drug <unk> pay him fifty dollar for <unk> ten <unk> of the green leaves over the border
it's the second time he has been caught
i was told that the boy who had been given a banana and a bottle of water by the guards would be taken back to the border and told to return home
all three looked small for their age
no one particularly them doubted they would be back
unemployment among younger people is running at forty percents in yemen likely higher in their villages
putting food on the table at the end of the day is as far ahead as they think
between them they had been caught with about thirty <unk> of the <unk>
piled up outside the guard post were several tons more the haul of the past week or so we were told
i'd seen similar piles outside many of the other posts we'd already visited
according to statistics given to us at the <unk> headquarters of the border guards <unk> is a multi million dollar business
in the last three months they say they have seized more than five hundred thousand tons along the border with a street value close to one hundred million dollar
they also showed us fifty kg of cannabis <unk> they had confiscated that day
over the past three months more than six thousand kg of <unk> with a street value in saudi of about thirty six million dollar had been seized we were told
guns and ammunition are also smuggled in
two thousand five hundred and sixty two weapons have been seized in the past three months as well as three hundred and eighty thousand and eighty eight rounds of ammunition the border guards said
and the list goes on
and so did our day and the near <unk> stream of <unk>
the problem for the saudis is that they can not ignore this <unk>
any one of the thousands they stop could be a terrorist
said kouachi one of the charlie hebdo attackers in paris is believed to have slipped in to yemen not far from <unk> border making his way there for terror training from oman
the attack he and his brother carried out also shows the lengths that aqap is willing to go to in order to export terror
<unk> <unk> to islam's two holiest sites mecca and medina draw millions of muslims to the kingdom
knowing who comes and who goes is vital
as the sun began to set we jumped in police gun trucks as another group of men were spotted near the razor wire border fence
tearing over the bumpy ground we raced to intercept them
surprisingly they didn't run
they know they'll be freed soon and from what we saw none of the six were beaten or abused
within minutes as we were driving away the sun sinking over the horizon and our day done we thought we passed another eight men being caught
we stopped as police <unk> the men's pockets
cheap cellphones not much else
they were illegal workers on their way back to homes in yemen after weeks of work in saudi their wages already sent over the border by local money <unk>
it was already <unk> as we pulled away once again trying to set off back to <unk>
and yet again we stopped as we saw a group of guards searching two small figures
more child <unk> smugglers rope and sack bags on their backs <unk> with the big wraps that protect the delicate green leaves
each boy carrying <unk> with the drug <unk> name on them
later when we finally did get back to <unk> we ate dinner sitting on <unk> next to the red sea
fish meat <unk> bread and saudi champagne non alcoholic <unk> <unk> juice
this is a land of plenty yemen is not
<unk> the human tide flowing over the border is only going to get more difficult and finding the terrorist hiding in so much human misery even harder

all that remains before the deal can be confirmed is for the medical to be done
this <unk> ritual will take place hundreds of times over the course of january and the summer transfer windows the industry's due diligence as professional footballers move from club to club in the two sanctioned periods of the year when players are bought and sold
understandably the purchasing party wants to discover the shape and fitness of their new investment
they also want to <unk> if there are any underlying conditions that could lead to injury in the future
given the amount spent it's a decision you don't want to get wrong
during the two thousand and thirteen fourteen english premier league season alone the amount spent on players who went on to get injured was one hundred and ninety four million according to data collected by the respected <unk> dot com website
but what actually goes on during this closed door process and how do doctors and <unk> arrive at their conclusions
this was a question i sought to answer late last year when invited to st. georges park state of the art training base of the england national team and home to perform the facility's specialized health care provider to experience the process myself
a leading <unk> club had refused my request to undergo a medical a matter of weeks before citing privacy concerns and an <unk> to reveal the tests they undertake
in such a competitive and publicity conscious industry perhaps that <unk> is <unk>
numerous clubs have been burned after signing players for large amounts of money only to discover they've purchased an asset that needs wrapping up in cotton wool rather than striking terror into the opposition
in late two thousand and thirteen west ham united co owner david sullivan suggested his club would not have bought striker andy carroll from liverpool for fifteen million had they known he would be injured so shortly after signing
arsenal boss arsene wenger made similar noises a few months later after learning he had snapped up an injured kim <unk> on loan from <unk> moscow
in other cases the discovery of latent injuries has led to deals being <unk> at the last minute much to the embarrassment of club and player
last summer french international striker <unk> <unk> looked set to sign for liverpool before coming <unk> in a medical
yet just a matter of weeks later <unk> was <unk> by chelsea after successfully being put through his <unk> by the london club's medical staff
given <unk> striking problems this season it's arguably a decision that the club might be <unk> now
asking how such a scenario can come to pass is one of the first points i put to dr charlotte <unk> formerly head of medical teams at tottenham hotspur and <unk> and now clinical director of perform at st. <unk> park
she explains that a player never really passes or fails a medical as is often portrayed in the media
instead it's all about creating a picture for the relevant manager board members and stakeholders at the buying club who can then make the decision about whether to proceed with a transfer or not
it's a risk benefit analysis <unk> said
in some cases a club may sign a player even if there are signs of wear and tear that may lead to future injuries if they haven't got the depth in their squad
other times there are clubs willing to take on somebody who is injured because they
agree between their medical staff that it's something they can get right over a period of a few months and will be a good investment in the future
we are speaking in dr <unk> office where she explains that her role is the first stage of the process
she will look to gather a complete medical history of a player
depending on the player this could be as simple as asking questions looking over notes from their previous clubs and taking some simple tests
or it could be more complex undertaking mri scans x ray tests or a full <unk> ultrasound
in some cases she could even send a player for analysis of their heart lungs and individual muscles if the initial research suggested there were specific problems
<unk> asks me about previous ailments and describes the main areas she will focus on today
with football lower limbs like knee and ankles are the areas that are most commonly injured she explained
however these are the obvious areas of stress that are relatively easy to analyze
others are not so simple
the hardest is around the hip and <unk> with players as sometimes they'll have had multiple problems that <unk> <unk> continued
someone that has a sports <unk> might also have problems with their hips and area around the pelvis
trying to <unk> if a player has a little bit of a problem and trying to predict how it will develop in the future is quite complicated sometimes she added
after a few more questions dr <unk> injury history and primary analysis is complete
next i head to the human performance lab where steve kemp elite <unk> at perform is waiting for me
formerly head of medical services at <unk> <unk> and also part of the england staff at world cup two thousand and fourteen in brazil kemp will look to test my <unk> and fitness levels
he straps me in an <unk> machine which will provide data on leg strength and compare any imbalances that may point to a tendency to put more stress on one leg over the other providing clues as to where injuries could arise in the future
how am i doing
kemp <unk> me i have somewhere between sixty percents to sixty five percents of the leg strength of professional athlete
more than content with that outcome we move across to the <unk> two max treadmill where i don a rather intimidating mask that wouldn't look out of place on tom <unk> <unk>
the point of this exercise is to measure oxygen and co two concentration from inhaled and <unk> air as i carry out the exercise
the speed of the treadmill will be gradually increased as will the <unk> at which it operates to <unk> out ever more data
unsurprisingly my endurance levels are more than a little down on the pros
by this stage time has crept up on us no doubt like many a medical department on transfer deadline day
we skip the sprint movement and reaction test components kemp would usually carry out and move to the <unk> table
here he'll analyze each joint individually to see if there are any <unk> or if there is any movement that is sub optimal
we'll look at the ankle the knee the foot the hip the lumbar spine and the shoulders particularly if they are a goalkeeper kemp <unk> me as he begins putting pressure on my knee joints
within seconds he tells me that i don't have full movement in one of my hips which could be the sign of an underlying problem
i'm surprised with the speed of this diagnosis
it took another medical practitioner more than three months to arrive at the same conclusion earlier in two thousand and fourteen
but working fast is often a necessity in the football medical game
obviously you could always do with more time but you just have to work with what you've got and get as much information as you can kemp explained
if there's anything we haven't managed to do we'll just highlight that
the hardest part for me is once it's all done writing it up and putting it into a one hundred to one hundred and fifty page document to give to the manager he adds
<unk> used to consist of little more than clubs handing over notes to one another a doctor going over things with the player and asking them if they were <unk> kemp said
there was very little testing or analysis done
its really important that the medical team get as much information as possible
not just to protect the board and the manager on their investment but also to gain as much information as possible on that player kemp continued
there's a good chance they're going to sign for five years
if they're having difficulties or struggling from any injuries you want to have as much information as possible to be able to find out why that information may have occurred
so <unk> i'll get as much information out of a medical as i can so i've got a really good picture of that athlete and hopefully i can give them the best care with that information
so how have i done
somewhat to my surprise kemp tells me he sees no significant problems despite the fitness levels not being where they should be
and while that may not be the most sparkling of references to any prospective manager it's also not a do not sign him warning

it's an <unk> worth remembering on arguably the most <unk> day in the football calendar as clubs rush to grab a deal on transfer deadline day
and according to one football scout a young man's friends can also tell you if he's going to make it big in the beautiful game
<unk> pfannenstiel is a former player who now works for german club hoffenheim scouring the globe in the hope of finding a future star
profiling players and seeing how they behave off the pitch is key to understanding whether they are right for the <unk> insists pfannenstiel who played for twenty five clubs during a rich and varied career
i can go to africa i can go to brazil i can find hundreds of top class players
but the question is will they really work in germany
the former goalkeeper told cnn
a fan of big cats pfannenstiel has some david <unk> like qualities in his observation of footballers
whether they are in training staying at a hotel or even just <unk> in a group he watches them closely for signs of <unk> behavior
it sounds very basic but if i see a player who walks around by himself with big <unk> on and ignores everything that is around him then i am not sure that that's the player i would like to have he explained
musical head gear is not the only thing that detective pfannenstiel checks up on with players social lives being put under a <unk> glass too
does he have bad friends
is he going out on the weekend
is he a really hard working professional
these are all things you can find out he said
networking is <unk> <unk> <unk> allowing him to keep track of players across the globe without <unk> too many air miles
whether players know it or not people close to them might be reporting back to scouts like pfannenstiel so it's important players are on their best behavior and keep the right company
there are guys who are basically looking at every woman in the team's hotel is that really what you want
it's good to have a personal profile it's good to see their behavior outside the football field
language can be another stumbling block for footballers hoping to make it big abroad with pfannenstiel setting a pass mark of being able to speak at least the basics
the goal is for players to be able to gel with teammates both on and off the pitch if they can't then pfannenstiel will have no <unk> about waving <unk> <unk> to them
he hopes that they will not just communicate with other players but also with the coaches with the fans
the player needs to be liked by the fans to be one hundred percents happy
in many ways hoffenheim <unk> the current transfer market within football
for a provincial club with a humble history in one thousand nine hundred and ninety nine their stadium held less than one thousand seven hundred fans <unk> status has been boosted by skilled players from abroad recruited after some hefty investments from chief financial backer <unk> <unk>
one foreign import who has impressed pfannenstiel is <unk> polanski a polish national player who joined hoffenheim in two thousand and thirteen and has since become an essential pillar of the team
wilfried bony has a similar story originally from the ivory coast he was prolific with <unk> in the netherlands before joining english premier league team swansea in two thousand and thirteen
bony was the top goal scorer in the <unk> during the calendar year two thousand and fourteen and has recently made a forty two point five million dollar move to manchester city
but not all players settle into foreign countries as easily as bony and polanski seem to have done
as pfannenstiel argues many times players from these countries fail
not because they're bad players they fail because they can't adjust
they can't adjust to the life to the culture and to the surroundings
failure is not an option for hoffenheim which would rather coach their domestic players to stardom than buy <unk> from abroad
tightening purse strings are another reason for the club to look for talent closer to home with some transfer fees skyrocketing during the january window
the clubs who give players away they know the prices are actually sometimes out of proportion pfannenstiel argues
the huge expense of some transfer fees means that clubs are under pressure to avoid any costly mistakes leaving clubs like hoffenheim to nurture local talent
we are not that desperate anymore to bring in foreigners left right and center we'd rather give youngsters a chance
it's a tactic that hoffenheim along with many other german clubs have used to their advantage
the number of players coming from the under <unk> into the premier league in germany is higher than it ever was before
the search is now on for top talent in football but pfannenstiel won't be looking too far afield

luis figo the man who could be king of football
the defendants were convicted of murdering eleven police and two civilians in august two thousand and thirteen egypt's state run <unk> news agency reported
those deaths came in an attack on a police station
it followed a massive deadly crackdown by egyptian forces on supporters of ousted president mohamed morsy
today's death sentences are yet another example of the bias of the egyptian criminal justice system said <unk> <unk> <unk> of amnesty international
these verdicts and sentences must be <unk> and all of those convicted should be given a trial that meets international standards of fairness and <unk> the death penalty
issuing mass death sentences whenever the case involves the killing of police officers now appears to be near routine policy regardless of facts and with no attempt to establish individual responsibility <unk> added
so far four hundred and fifteen people have been sentenced to death in four trials for the killing of police officers while the case against former president hosni mubarak involving the killing of hundreds of protesters during the uprising has been dropped
to date no security officers have been held to account for the killing of one thousand protesters in august two thousand and thirteen the organization said on its website
amnesty international opposes the death penalty altogether
thirty four of the one hundred and eighty three defendants were tried in <unk>
all are permitted to appeal
in july and august two thousand and thirteen hundreds of demonstrators perhaps more than a thousand were killed by egyptian forces in what human rights watch said probably amounts to crimes against humanity
the authorities have failed to hold even a single low level police or army officer accountable for any of the killings much less any official responsible for ordering them and continue to brutally suppress dissent the group said
it issued a one hundred and eighty eight page report titled all according to plan
the <unk> massacre and mass killings of protesters in egypt
since august two thousand and thirteen three hundred and forty three police personnel have been killed egypt's ministry of interior says
at the heart of all this is the battle for control of egypt that has gripped the country for four years
morsy a longtime fixture in the muslim brotherhood became egypt's first <unk> elected president in two thousand and twelve
but he was <unk> a year later in a military coup after mass protests
also in two thousand and thirteen egyptian authorities cracked down on former morsy supporters
in december of that year egypt's interim government officially declared the muslim brotherhood a terrorist organization
egypt's current government led by president abdel fattah el sisi has called for a religious revolution and asked muslim leaders to help in the fight against extremism
he has launched a war against terrorism focused particularly on the country's sinai region where an extremist group recently pledged allegiance to isis
president abdel fattah al sisi touched on the desperate state of the economy the deadly jihadist <unk> in sinai the role of religion in politics and human rights
amid this litany of woes the jailing of greste who is australian and two other al jazeera journalists in egypt had become an embarrassment for a government whose human rights record was already receiving plenty of adverse attention
in july soon after their sentences were handed down to an international outcry president al sisi acknowledged the case had been a pr disaster for egypt
he told local journalists the trial had been very negative for the country's reputation
i wished they had been deported immediately after their arrest instead of being put on trial he said
greste was arrested at the end of two thousand and thirteen along with al jazeera cairo bureau chief mohamed fahmy and producer baher mohamed
they were accused of <unk> false information and belonging to a terrorist organization
after a four month trial greste and fahmy received seven year sentences
mohammed got ten years
as of monday fahmy and mohamed were still behind bars
the case against them was part of a heavy handed campaign against anyone who had anything to do with members or supporters of the muslim brotherhood which was <unk> a terrorist organization soon after al sisi and the military seized power
that campaign was supported by almost hysterical media coverage of the threat within
human rights groups say thousands of brotherhood members are in jail awaiting trial
nearly two hundred more have been sentenced to death
throughout the proceedings against the al jazeera journalists the egyptian government from al sisi <unk> insisted it had no part in the judicial process
few observers took that at face value
many thought the trio were <unk> in a confrontation between al sisi and the <unk> of qatar which funds al jazeera
the charges even suggested as much accusing the trio of broadcasting scenes through the qatari jazeera channel to assist the muslim brotherhood terrorist group in achieving its purposes of influencing international public opinion
australian foreign minister julie bishop also alluded to the political <unk> of the case when the three men were sentenced saying
al jazeera is not the favorite news channel in egypt
so my fear is that peter greste was in the wrong place at the wrong time
throughout the middle east from syria to gaza to libya qatar has funded and supported groups affiliated with the muslim brotherhood since the arab spring erupted four years ago
among <unk> allies was the leader of egypt's muslim brotherhood mohammed <unk> who became president in june two thousand and twelve but was ousted by al sisi a year later
egypt's traditional allies were openly <unk> by the sentences against the three
the white house <unk> the prosecution of journalists for reporting information that does not coincide with the government of egypt's narrative
but the journalists trial was part of a pattern
human rights watch said the prosecution coming after the prosecution of protesters and academics shows how fast the space for dissent in egypt is evaporating
one of many examples
<unk> <unk> an academic and former member of parliament was charged with insulting the judiciary after a tweet claiming the conviction of forty three employees of pro democracy organizations demonstrated the <unk> of the judiciary
he is yet to be tried
it was a <unk> campaign that seemed tone deaf toward governments that had long enjoyed good relations with egypt and which in the case of the united states provided billions in military aid
and as harrowing as the experience of the three al jazeera journalists has been others have suffered worse fates according to human rights groups
after al sisi was elected president human rights watch urged him to investigate the police and army killings of more than one thousand four hundred demonstrators over the past twelve months and the mounting allegations of torture and other ill treatment of detainees
egyptian officials might argue that the al jazeera case was one component of a broader strategy to get qatar to mend its ways and that it worked
in the wake of the military takeover in egypt qatar had become a sanctuary for egyptian brotherhood leaders
but in recent months the <unk> have quietly distanced themselves from prominent brotherhood figures
several left qatar in september although the <unk> insisted they had not been expelled
weeks later al sisi issued a decree allowing egypt to <unk> foreign prisoners which is exactly what has happened to greste
fahmy holds both canadian and egyptian citizenship so the same procedure seems likely in his case but baher mohamed is egyptian and his fate remains unclear
which brings us back the speech al sisi was making sunday as greste was being deported
it came two days after the jihadist group ansar <unk> al <unk> an affiliate of the islamic state in iraq and syria carried out its most audacious attack yet on security <unk> in the sinai desert killing at least thirty people
acknowledging the threat from islamist <unk> al sisi spoke of a dangerous mass that has for the past thirty to forty years been spreading extremist thought and doesn't want to understand that god had created us different
al sisi announced that east of the <unk> canal is now a single military command under the leadership of general osama <unk> to fight terrorism
but it's the second time in four months he has promised the egyptian people that he will combat extremism in sinai
he also addressed the shooting death in cairo last week of political activist <unk> <unk> while casting himself as father of the nation
<unk> was the daughter of egypt and all the daughters and sons of egypt are my children al sisi said promising an investigation
activists claim <unk> was shot by police during protests to mark the fourth anniversary of the two thousand and eleven uprising in which more than twenty people were killed
anti government protests have become more frequent despite the best efforts of the security forces
on the <unk> state of the egyptian economy and its public finances al sisi was equally <unk> thanking saudi arabia and the united arab emirates for their financial support estimated at eleven billion dollar in the year to july two thousand and fourteen
if it was not for your support egypt would not have survived until now he said
but he also admitted the government was still strapped for cash
egypt does not have one hundred and fifty billion egyptian pounds to spend on its people
simply put amid this dire outlook the al jazeera case became an <unk> that al <unk> government could do without
as president al sisi himself made clear the war on the muslim brotherhood will continue to be pursued <unk>
but his opponents at home and many international observers see a broader and <unk> campaign against dissent of any sort
japanese journalist kenji goto went to syria to tell the stories of lives torn apart by war
he apparently became the latest foreigner killed by isis after a video distributed saturday appears to show his beheaded body
a week earlier another video had shown goto holding a photo of what appeared to be the corpse of his fellow japanese captive haruna yukawa apparently beheaded by isis militants as well
jordan and japan got caught in the militants bloody <unk> last month when isis threatened to kill the two japanese hostages unless japan's government paid a ransom of two hundred million dollar
the militants revised their offer
jordan should release female suicide bomber sajida al rishawi
jordan countered with an offer demanding the release of <unk> al kassasbeh a jordanian military pilot captured in syria in exchange for the suicide bomber
the militants have not said if that's a consideration
isis said it would kill him if jordan didn't release al rishawi a convicted terrorist
despite the <unk> the pilot's fate remains unclear and jordan says repeated demands for the militants to prove the pilot is still alive have not yielded any results
isis militants seized al kassasbeh was after his jet crashed in syria in december
the twenty seven year old holds the rank of lieutenant
militants say they captured him after he ejected from his crashing f sixteen during u.s. led coalition airstrikes near isis de facto capital raqqa
jordan's role in the coalition is not popular in the nation adding to the pressure for authorities to secure his release
world leaders condemned isis over the weekend as news of the latest apparent beheading spread
we are deeply saddened by this despicable and horrendous act of terrorism and we denounce it in the strongest terms japanese prime minister shinzo abe said
to the terrorists we will never never forgive them for this act
president barack obama described it as a barbaric act and said the united states stands in solidarity with japan
unlike the united states britain and other allies japan is not involved in the military campaign against isis
but japan has been providing humanitarian aid in the middle east as isis continues its bloody quest to <unk> an islamic state across parts of iraq and syria
and japan said its efforts to provide humanitarian aid won't stop
we would like to expand our support for refugees chief cabinet secretary yoshihide suga said
we are surely going to have necessary support in terms of not <unk> to terrorism
goto forty seven left japan last fall when his younger daughter was three weeks old
his wife rinko first heard from his captors on december two
on january twenty an isis video posted to social media showed goto and yukawa dressed in orange kneeling in front of a masked man dressed in black
in that video the isis militant issued a two hundred million dollar ransom demand to japan in order to free the two men within seventy two hours
that's the same amount of money abe recently pledged for those contending with isis
days later a new message surfaced featuring what appeared to be the corpse of yukawa
and goto would also be killed the new message claimed unless jordan freed al rishawi
the militants carried out their threat saturday
days after the video was released an outraged japan is mourning the two men whose deaths will plunge it deeper into the global fight against isis
the pilot's fate on the other hand remains unclear
he was not mentioned in the latest video showing goto's apparent beheading
jordan will continue trying to secure his release government spokesman mohammed al momani told the petra news agency
until then the wait continues
two nations forever linked by the fate of their sons
a man was arrested at two fifteen p.m. est sunday afternoon outside the white house for attempting to climb a temporary bicycle rack on pennsylvania avenue u.s. secret service spokesman brian leary confirmed to cnn

he has been placed into the custody of dc police
the pioneering kenyan doctor was just nine years old when a girl was rushed across the border from southern ethiopia to northern kenya
a few years his senior she was severely dehydrated and barely holding on
everyone was trying to <unk> her and my uncle a local <unk> technician saw the horrified look on my face
i was just a terrified kid so he took me home
but osman couldn't get the girl off his mind
he persuaded his uncle to let him return to the hospital a few weeks later to see the girl
he was amazed to find she had nearly made a full recovery something that would inspire him to help others later in life
another human being managed to bring her back to life and i should also be able to do the same if i try my best he recalls thinking
though friends and family laughed off <unk> interest in medicine his mother voiced her support
you know these guys have never seen a black doctor before she said at the time
looking back osman admits their reaction wasn't too surprising
he was after all living in a rural part of kenya where <unk> form most of the population
but he refused to let that stand in the way of pursuing his dream a journey that has taken him far away from his <unk> home and eventually to the united states
osman is currently based in <unk> maryland near washington d.c. and best known as a pioneer in <unk> spine surgery
patients who are usually required to spend days in hospital can often walk out of his clinic just hours after surgery
a fellow doctor from hawaii became the world's first patient to undergo one of <unk> <unk> spine surgeries in the mid one thousand nine hundred and ninety s. he had the first ever <unk> <unk> <unk> and fusion as an outpatient
a medical milestone it was the culmination of several years of research
he called osman three days after his surgery declaring
it's the first time in four years that i'm able to stand on one leg while putting on my pants
but back surgery doesn't come without serious risks
patients undergoing a currently popular <unk> invasive surgery face a complication risk of up to sixty seven percents
moreover such procedures often result in some form of nerve damage
osman is able to dramatically reduce those numbers by drilling a hole through the pelvic bone
this allows him to access the injured lowest lumbar disc while avoiding damage to spinal muscles or entry into the spinal canal where nerves can be injured
it also doesn't involve access through the abdomen
the procedure is called trans <unk> approach to <unk> <unk>
hundreds of surgeries later osman says he still hasn't come across any side effects in patients
he does however explain that the method still isn't common in the u.s. or around the world
this hasn't stopped osman from sharing his groundbreaking technique with others
now more surgeons are embracing the approach as they become more familiar with it
it's my duty to tell the medical community to look at my technique if they truly have the patient's best interest at heart
he recently released the first clinical result of the approach while the original study was published in the journal of spine in one thousand nine hundred and ninety seven
he also introduced a technique called <unk> <unk> <unk> the same year
doctors as far away as south korea and china are now practicing the method
dr. anthony <unk> is best known as the former president of the world congress of <unk> invasive spine surgery and techniques
he says <unk> approach is growing rapidly in popularity among spine specialists around the world who are now using the procedure on a routine basis
these are highly specialized surgeons explains <unk> who currently heads up the international <unk> and <unk> therapy society
osman was born and raised in <unk> a place he describes as a small but <unk> market town between ethiopia and kenya
people from different ethnic and religious backgrounds lived together in harmony something he says was unusual for a region largely divided into tribal areas
each level of education osman completed took him further and further away from his family
nothing distracted me
i moved forward knowing everything was helping me reach my goal
i also began seeing black doctors the closer i got to nairobi
he trained at <unk> national hospital the country's largest healthcare treatment facility
it wasn't long before word of his success reached local communities in <unk> and those needing medical attention sought out his help in nairobi
while treating them was a very fulfilling experience osman grew frustrated as he wasn't able to <unk> to everyone's needs
this coupled with the need to complete his post graduate education eventually led to his decision to leave kenya
he was accepted to scotland's prestigious royal college of surgeons of <unk> in one thousand nine hundred and eighty
i'm kenyan wherever i go in the world and nothing can ever change that osman told <unk> head of surgery who was sad to see his favorite student go
osman eventually relocated to the united states where foreign doctors must get <unk> to practice medicine
i wanted to advance technology in spine surgery but how can i do that while i'm doing <unk> for the next three to four years
so i asked myself where will the world of spine surgery be ten years from now
predicting the future allowed osman to <unk> cutting edge medical procedures while still transitioning to working as a doctor in the u.s
some thirty years later his success story appears to have inspired a new generation of high <unk> in his rural hometown
osman explains his village in <unk> at one point produced the highest number of doctors veterinary surgeons nurses and engineers per capita in <unk> county
he remembers receiving an email from a young man about ten years ago
it turned out he came from the same village and was studying electrical engineering in kansas
he said if there was no said osman i probably wouldn't be here
i felt tears running down my cheeks and realized that i've achieved what i set out to do
to lead by example so others can use their potential to get more out of life
<unk> ultimate ambition is to produce an artificial skeleton which mimics a natural one as closely as technology allows
that goal could already be well within his reach
he has patents for growing artificial bones and joints as well as replacing damaged discs in the spine with <unk> materials
i still see that twelve year old girl in front of me he says
that's who i'm treating every day
if my patients are smiling then i have achieved my dream
the beloved writer actor and twitter devotee will sit down with cnn's max foster monday afternoon and he'll be taking the best of your questions
what do you want to know
tweet your question for fry with <unk> or leave it in the comments below
then watch this space for the full interview
zhang fan and zhang <unk> were executed monday after their death sentences were approved by the supreme people's court the xinhua news agency
the report stated that before their deaths zhang and zhang were allowed to meet with their families for a final time
they were among five members of the church of almighty god or <unk> tried on murder charges in august two thousand and fourteen over the killing of a woman in <unk> <unk> province
a court statement said the victim a thirty seven year old woman named wu <unk> was attacked after refusing to give her phone number to the group who were allegedly attempting to recruit new members
three other cult members <unk> <unk> zhang hang and zhang <unk> were sentenced to life ten and seven years in prison respectively for their roles in the attack
the four <unk> were related according to xinhua
the church of almighty god has been linked to kidnappings violence and extortion and has been banned by china's ministry of public security since one thousand nine hundred and ninety five
also known as eastern lightning the group <unk> that the <unk> are engaged in an apocalyptic struggle against china's communist party which it refers to as the great red dragon
founded in the one thousand nine hundred and ninety s in <unk> province the group believes that jesus has been <unk> as yang <unk> the wife of the group's founder <unk> <unk>
the couple live in the united states after fleeing to the country in two thousand according to xinhua
in august chinese state media reported that police had arrested nearly one thousand suspected members of the group including nearly one hundred <unk> members
the report said those arrested were responsible for numerous suicides and murders including those of their own family
in two thousand and twelve hundreds of members were rounded up after the group publicly proclaimed the end of the world was imminent
in a statement provided to cnn in june hong kong based members of the group responsible for its english language website said it was very natural for the chinese communist party to blame the group for the mcdonald's death because the party <unk> and then suppressed those that disagreed with it
they always find some excuse in advance and <unk> things and <unk> them said the statement
contract workers made the discovery in the city of <unk> around sixty kilometers southwest of <unk>
while cleaning a <unk> part of a city police station late last week the workers <unk> upon <unk> filled with human remains in a room that had been locked for a long time
until two thousand and eight the room was used as a <unk> where bodies were kept before funerals ram <unk> yadav an additional superintendent of police for <unk> district told cnn
in mid two thousand and eight he said the <unk> was shifted to an area hospital
these body parts were to be shifted to the district hospital <unk> but we don't know how they have since been kept here in the police station he said
an investigation is still ongoing
foul play is not suspected officials say but they are not sure why the bodies were not <unk> of properly
in hinduism and some other indian faiths funerals are usually conducted by cremation
officials say the bodies are likely to be at least twenty years old
another police official said that dna testing would be conducted on the remains
opposition lawmakers have called for an in depth investigation
<unk> <unk> party state legislator <unk> gupta told the <unk> times that his party will take up the issue with the chief minister and organize a movement on this issue
the discovery comes two weeks after around eighty skeletons and <unk> bodies surfaced in the ganges india's holiest river in the district
the two cult members father and daughter zhang <unk> and zhang fan were executed in east china's <unk> province on monday following the approval of the use of the death penalty by the supreme people's court
the pair had been convicted of committing intentional homicide in the <unk> <unk> city
the convicted duo attacked and ultimately killed a thirty seven year old woman wu <unk> last year after she refused to give cult members her phone number during a recruitment drive in the fast food restaurant
the pair along with three other people convicted in the attack including two other members of the zhang family belonged to the church of almighty god or <unk>
linked to kidnappings violence and extortion the church of almighty god has been on a list of fourteen banned religious groups issued by china's ministry of public security since one thousand nine hundred and ninety five
the three other members of the cult involved in the incident were sentenced in october to jail terms ranging from seven years to life
zhang fan and <unk> another member of the group called the victim an evil spirit before zhang <unk> her head with a chair then jumped on her and <unk> her head state media reported at the time of their conviction in october
before the execution <unk> municipal <unk> people's court arranged for zhang fan and zhang <unk> to meet with their family
but super bowl xlix will be remembered for its exciting crazy ending the kind of final scene that would have a hollywood <unk> saying <unk> nobody would ever believe that
in the end it was the nfl's glamorous star tom brady leading the patriots to a twenty eight twenty four heart pounding win and an <unk> rookie defensive back making an astonishing play to seal the win
after weeks of answering relentless questions about reportedly soft balls new england joined five other elite nfl teams with a fourth super bowl trophy
here are some highlights and <unk> from the game on the field and off
pete carroll looked so smart at the end of the first half making an <unk> call that resulted in an unexpected touchdown with time running out
but with twenty seconds left in the game and the seahawks scrambling for a potential game winning <unk> he blew it
he just blew it
as the patriots lined up to stop a run carroll called for a pass
with one of the best running backs in the game one nicknamed beast mode for his pounding running style carroll called for a pass
on the one yard line
there are three things that can happen when you pass they say and two of them are bad
that was my fault totally carroll told nbc of the play that ended with an interception and had the champagne <unk> u turning back to the patriots locker room
you know what the seahawks were thinking
that pass play works almost every time
it's hard to cover and it's only one yard
and they expect us to run
i thought it was going to be a touchdown seahawks quarterback russell wilson said
the guy just made a great play
butler said he just had a feeling of what to do
i knew what was going to happen he said according to nfl dot com
i don't know how i knew
i just knew
i just beat him to the point and caught the ball
tom brady now three time super bowl <unk> and four time winner of the big game isn't concerned with where people rank him among the all time great <unk>
after all it's not like he's about to retire and head off into a sunset with a <unk> wife
although that's not such a bad idea
i've got a lot of football left the thirty seven year old fifteen year veteran told reporters
i never put myself in those discussions
that's not how i think
you just have to enjoy the moment
brady called the seahawks no
one ranked defense incredible but when it was winning time it was brady who was incredible
on the game winning drive he threw nine passes
all of them were caught
one didn't count because of a penalty on the patriots
his team trailed by ten going into the fourth quarter
he went thirteen for fifteen for one hundred and twenty four yards and had two touchdown <unk>
we made the plays brady said deflecting the credit
we blocked great
we made great catches
it's a team effort
it's never one player
while brady won't quantify where he ranks <unk> report's mike freeman said the performance proved the pats quarterback is the best at his position ever
no one is better than brady
in this super bowl
in any super bowl
in history freeman wrote
um did that dude just act like he was pulling down his pants to celebrate a touchdown
signs point to yes
in the third quarter doug baldwin found himself wide open in the end zone and made an easy catch for six
he tumbled on the ground then got up and spun the ball on the turf to express his joy
after taking a moment to <unk> baldwin decided to celebrate his score some more
he ran over to the ball and made a motion <unk> someone removing his trousers
and then the nbc feed went to a <unk> tom brady on the patriots bench
what did we miss
needless to say the officials <unk> baldwin while the internet celebrated
thank you <unk> internet and <unk>
<unk> is my favorite hashtag ever
the end of the super bowl could be called the good bad and the ugly
there was a great catch a questionable play call and a fight
with new england running out the clock and tom brady down on a knee players should have been shaking hands and hugging after a hard fought game
but it was then that actual fighting broke out
the seahawks had just given the patriots breathing room with an <unk> penalty when some of the seattle players shoved their opponents after the kneel down
the patriots pushed back
there's a lot of frustration out there nbc <unk> al michaels said as players knocked others down and tackled each other the wrong way
a few <unk> were delivered too
seahawks linebacker bruce <unk> was kicked out the first player in the game's history to be ejected
who knew that your super bowl shopping list should have included drinks snacks
and tissues
plenty of tissues
it was a very serious year for commercials including one from nationwide that featured an actor essentially playing the ghost of a dead child
the video received thousands of thumbs down on youtube
one person said it wasn't the commercial it was the timing of it during the big game which is supposed to be the ultimate sunday <unk>
a twitter user agreed the ad was wrong for the moment

seen as tricky mean and unwilling to keep his promises the australian leader has been under pressure recently to resign
to stem the criticism abbott offered a few olive branches
more consultation with his colleagues more control over foreigners buying in to the property market in australia's major cities and a crackdown on islamic groups sympathetic to isis
throughout however he made it clear he was staying put
since his election in september two thousand and thirteen abbott has accumulated more critics than supporters
a litany of broken promises and a stalled budget have left his achievements looking <unk>
he had promised there would be no cuts to health education and pensions nor the national broadcasters abc and the <unk>
all have since faced reduced funding
his first budget has been hijacked by minor party objections and horse trading
many measures remain stuck in the senate the upper house of the australian parliament
he's managed to keep one of his central promises
to dump a carbon tax introduced by julia <unk> the predecessor he <unk> for breaking promises
and his government can be fairly said to have stopped the <unk> of asylum seekers making their way to australia from indonesian ports
this was achieved after several years during which up to one thousand people died on the journey
however even that achievement has come at a cost to his personal reputation
sending asylum seekers to australian run camps in <unk> new guinea and <unk> has ended in riots and one death
when he honored prince philip the husband of the queen of england with a <unk> the fuse of national anger ignited
he is appearing to be a tin <unk> leader out of touch with ordinary australians
<unk> took the opportunity to slap down his conservative allies by throwing them out of office in a statewide election last weekend
talk had begun worsening after the queensland poll that abbott would be dumped if he refused to resign

poll after poll reveals the extent of his unpopularity
a fairfax <unk> poll taken in late january shows the government would lose the next election by a landslide based on current figures
<unk> personal approval rating has <unk> too
the two cabinet ministers most often talked about as likely to challenge him for the top job have pledged loyalty albeit in muted tones
abbott didn't deny he had sought an assurance of loyalty from his deputy foreign minister julie bishop
i accept this is a government which has gone through a difficult patch
all governments go through difficult patches he said
this will be a test of character
now politicians pass the test when they do what is best for the long term not when they give in to short term fear and make a difficult situation worse
as for julie she's a friend of mine
julie is my deputy
she's been a terrific deputy and a terrific minister
i believe i have her support and i certainly look forward to continuing to have that
on his other rival communications minister malcolm turnbull there was silence
turnbull is a popular figure and the preferred conservative leader for those who vote for the opposition the australian labor party
however <unk> pro climate change pro same sex marriage stance makes him a difficult alternative for his own party to accept as leader
for the moment turnbull is <unk> the line and publicly stating he supports his leader
given the frenzy of anger and disappointment unleashed against abbott over the past week and the anticipation attached to monday's appearance it was clear the prime minister would never be able to achieve the bar set for him
in the end he did all that he could do
he begged his colleagues to stick with him and warned australians that if they followed queensland they'd face the re introduction of a carbon tax
wiping it from the statute books he says has saved the average australian household five hundred dollar a year
it might sound <unk> to assert that five hundred dollar a year is all that stands between tony abbott prime minister and tony abbott washed up politician
but given his nemesis turnbull has long advocated action on climate change it's <unk> than it sounds

but patriots <unk> malcolm butler intercepted a russell wilson pass at the goal line and put an end to the seahawks quest for a repeat championship
a play that had most people scratching their heads and wondering why did anyone tell russell wilson to throw that ball when he could have handed it to the unstoppable <unk> lynch instead
the unnecessary <unk> by the seahawks that followed as the patriots were just eighteen seconds away from the <unk> trophy exemplified the frustrations of sports when things just don't go your way
but run don't pass wasn't the only thing we learned during this game
one
commercials are to the super bowl what articles are to playboy but they aren't as much fun when you've seen most of them online before kickoff
at roughly four point five million dollar per thirty second spot why not wait for game night to air them and make sure we all pay attention
this year's fare tended to be of the <unk> sort such as <unk> puzzling dead kid commercial and <unk> heart wrenching lost puppy story which hopefully offset the go daddy ad that got pulled after animal rights activists threw a flag on the field because they claimed it promoted puppy mills
there was also the inspirational from dodge with its series of centenarians <unk> out advice to the always like a girl campaign which <unk> at twitter's <unk> all night long
luckily for viewers danny <unk> and steve <unk> as marcia and jan respectively provided some much needed comic relief in a hilarious brady bunch <unk> for snickers
two
we knew that <unk> lynch could never be accused of leaving his game at the press conference
this past week most stories about the seahawks <unk> revolved around his i'm just here so i won't get fined <unk> than his on field skills
while the sports press should be used to this lynch refused to speak to the press long before now it remains a delightful game for <unk> to continue to ask lynch questions they know he won't answer
after warming up in his peculiar looking high altitude training mask which he claims gives him a boost during games lynch played like a man on fire moving mountains
as nbc's <unk> <unk> said when lynch gets going everything starts to work
any questions
didn't think so

in addition to reminding us just how many hits she has had in her relatively short career katy perry's halftime show created a <unk> of realities between live and sync
her seemingly animated pop world the beach scene for teenage dream and california girls felt like a trailer for the upcoming <unk> movie got down to business with a gender bending i kissed a girl <unk> with lenny kravitz
then halftime took off when missy elliot who hasn't had an album in ten years <unk> out get <unk> freak on
but all eyes were on perry as she hit her stride with her anthem <unk> rising over the field on a sparkling comet accompanied by <unk> that made it feel more like the opening ceremony of the beijing olympics than football night in america
wasn't it nice to have a performer in her prime play the biggest night in television

sometimes it takes a game like this to remind us that there are several key players on the patriots besides the record breaking tom brady whose celebrity took a knocking in recent days with the <unk> of deflategate
rob <unk> the tight end with his own cereal <unk> <unk> caught whatever mr. <unk> threw at him while defensive tackle <unk> <unk> seemed like the only thing on this planet that could stop <unk> lynch
playing in his fourth super bowl for the pats <unk> <unk> the <unk> of football
a huge guy bursting out of his uniform who runs like the wind moves like an <unk> <unk> on so you think you can dance and then tackles his target like a soviet tank
oh and don't forget that he's a <unk> hero
on his way home from the afc championship game against the indianapolis colts <unk> helped a woman who rolled her <unk> <unk> off the road just outside of gillette stadium

and what about those balls
while many rooted for a seahawks victory out of spite for the routinely <unk> patriots the team from new england was largely acquitted of wrongdoing in the last few days as the nfl finally concluded that ten of the eleven deflated balls were just a few ticks under the minimum lending weight to the conclusion that cold weather was largely responsible

school officials remain tight lipped about the threats they've received from militants but stories have emerged of empty coffins being sent to <unk> as an ominous suggestion of the danger that could lie ahead
after the brutal attack pakistan taliban spokesman mohammed <unk> told cnn the bloodshed was revenge for the killing of hundreds of innocent <unk> during repeated army operations in provinces including south waziristan north waziristan and the khyber agency
last month the provincial government pledged to spend seven billion rupees on enhancing security at government run schools in khyber <unk>
however <unk> information minister <unk> ghani says it is still not enough prevent in an attack on the thirty five thousand government run schools in the province
so in an extraordinary measure the <unk> government has allowed teachers with firearm licenses to keep guns at school
umar <unk> a mild <unk> primary school teacher who has been a member of the executive council of <unk> primary teacher association for more than twenty years is shocked by the decision
why would you <unk> guns
he asks
if teachers take guns into classroom it <unk> this deadly weapon in the eyes of children and in the future it could inspire them to seek out guns misuse them and cause more tragedies to take place
teachers are meant to teach he adds
at a shooting range in peshawar the khyber <unk> police force has started basic weapon training sessions for teachers interested in learning how to use firearms
faisal <unk> a police superintendent says that one of the reasons given for arming teachers is so they can hold militants at bay during a potential attack until security forces arrive
around twenty female teachers have already received training from inspector <unk> <unk>
most had never held a gun before
the tragedy of december sixteen has emboldened these women <unk> tells cnn
most of them were mothers and they were helpless then they will be never helpless again
regardless of the day's training <unk> says none of the teachers involved have expressed interest in obtaining a gun license
back at the <unk> office saeed places the gun on his desk and shares his experience of volunteering at hospitals on the day of the attack
his eyes tear up as he recalls seeing <unk> as young as twelve with bullet wounds that would not be uncommon on a battlefield
he brushes away those who criticize the decision to bring in guns to schools saying these are extraordinary times and we must deal with them in extraordinary ways
after what i have seen i refuse to be helpless and unarmed if anyone comes in to attack my students the way the militants did in december
we were once warriors of the <unk> and the <unk>

the thirty seven year old sacked and twice intercepted refused to give in as the patriots at one point down by ten fought their way to a twenty eight twenty four victory over the seattle seahawks in <unk> arizona
they were helped by one of the less likely calls in football history as seattle threw a second consecutive super bowl title into the hands of malcolm butler
patriots rookie butler made a game saving interception when the seahawks with the ball on the one yard line and seconds to play <unk> chose to pass after an improbable juggling miracle catch by <unk> <unk>
that moment gave brady and coach bill belichick a fourth super bowl victory a feat matched by only two other <unk>
joe montana and terry <unk>
i just had a vision that i was going to make a big play and it came true said butler twenty four
<unk> brady said
this has been a long journey
i've been at it for fifteen years
this one came down to the end and this time we made the plays
our defense what can you say about them
malcolm what a play
for a rookie to make a play like that and win us the super bowl is unbelievable
ahead of the game belichick had been booed inside <unk> university of phoenix stadium the <unk> roof unusually left open as <unk> <unk> the voice of <unk> elsa sang the pre game national anthem
belichick and brady have denied any wrongdoing regarding the lengthy and unresolved deflategate <unk> which concerns underinflated footballs in the afc championship game against indianapolis
however brady was <unk> on the subject in a pre game interview aired on sunday and the <unk> as belichick appeared on the big screen made the feelings of many clear
with that controversy <unk> for the night the forty nine th super <unk> momentum changed as rapidly as perry's halftime hits and outfits
the patriots had largely <unk> seattle before the interval brady wearing down the seahawks defense drive by drive
brady in his sixth super bowl found brandon <unk> for the opening touchdown
in the process the patriots left <unk> famed legion of boom <unk> on bust
seattle <unk> jeremy lane had already departed the field with an ugly arm injury the price he paid for a successful interception and with team mates <unk> chancellor earl thomas and richard sherman all carrying injuries substitute <unk> simon became the latest <unk> on the wrong end of a collision as he failed to stop <unk>
seattle quarterback russell wilson essentially anonymous to this point struck back with the night's first phenomenal pass to twenty five year old rookie and former shoe salesman chris <unk>
that allowed the nfl's quiet man <unk> lynch to drive over the line and score
patriots tight end rob <unk> <unk> down <unk> wright to restore new england's advantage but that only served to cue up one of the <unk> plays in super bowl history
with seconds remaining in the half the seahawks abandoned the safe option of a field goal
instead wilson wasted just one point seven nine seconds in delivering a bullet pass down the throat of a <unk> <unk> in the end zone
cue katy perry who brought an almost overwhelming array of lights <unk> and songs to a halftime show she dedicated to her younger self
arriving on a giant mechanical lion before graduating to a <unk> with sharks perry opened with roar before <unk> in split second blasts of dark horse i kissed a girl teenage dream and <unk> <unk> during which she ascended aboard a shooting star
guest star missy elliott emerged to an energetic get <unk> freak on <unk> the show's other name lenny kravitz to the background
when play <unk> seattle were at the <unk>
having barely seen the ball that last gasp score sent the seahawks into the second half in possession and in control
the <unk> champions immediately moved up by three <unk> again wrapping up a forty five yard pass play to set up a seahawks field goal
after brady threw his second interception of the night seattle wide receiver doug baldwin <unk> lost new england's <unk> <unk> by running him into an official leaving baldwin all alone in the end zone and the nfc champions ahead by ten
brady had been nowhere near perfect but demonstrated his determination as he shrugged off a poor throw missing julian <unk> to find danny <unk> and get the patriots rolling again
watched by the likes of paul <unk> will <unk> and mark <unk> the intensity of new england's offense ground down the depleted legion as the final minutes <unk> away
with two minutes remaining brady once again tried to find <unk> in the end zone
this time he was successful and the patriots had overcome a ten point deficit
seattle however should have had the last laugh
having been granted a near unbelievable slice of good fortune as the falling <unk> used both knees and a hand to somehow hold on to a pass the seahawks made what some observers <unk> one of the worst calls in football history
on the brink of back to back super bowl victories seattle elected to throw the ball <unk> lynch and <unk> butler the interception
following that staggering climax the game's dying moments descended into a mass brawl which led to the <unk> of the seahawks bruce <unk>
by that point the fight simply delayed an inevitable new england victory
i can't even tell you i can't even feel it said seahawks coach pete carroll of the decision to throw the ball
for it to come down to a play like that i hate that we have to live with that
new england's <unk> said
we made more plays we executed when we had to we have a mentally tough team that works their <unk> off
we are the <unk> of what boston is all about
expectations were mixed going into the show
would she fall flat like the patriots footballs or take off like a <unk>
she had the support of well <unk> like ex russell brand who promised baffled brits that the halftime show would be amazing
but really we were just eager for a reprieve from the <unk> first half between the seahawks and the patriots
regardless of whether you appreciated her artistry the show delivered throughout on memorable moments from perry's entrance atop a robot tiger dressed in a suit of flames until her exit on a star that drew comparisons to nbc's more you know logo
much of the credit goes to guest stars lenny kravitz and missy elliott whom some deemed more worthy of the spotlight
first up was kravitz who joined in a <unk> of i kissed a girl
people were excited if not somewhat confused by the pairing
then perry <unk> to a tropical landscape of dancing beach balls palm trees and sharks for california girls and everyone started wondering whether we were in a teenage dream or on a bad acid trip
luckily snoop dogg <unk> in to assure us that yes the landscape was real and he knows because he was there
then missy elliott arrived to help perry get her freak on much to everyone's delight
some would say she stole the show
but the real <unk> was her exit on a star that drew comparisons to nbc's famous more you know star
what's the verdict
overall most seemed to delight in <unk> perry and were generally pleased that the show delivered enough moments to make into memes and objects of mockery
our friends at hln probably said it best
<unk> dancing sharks are the thing to beat this superbowl sunday
it could be a scene from a print by nineteen th century japanese artist <unk> but behind the <unk> image is a modern story
leading the four through the <unk> of <unk> the ski resort on the northern island of <unk> is <unk> graham
she's an australian citizen who first moved to japan when she was just fifteen and in two thousand and seven became a geisha
now working and living as <unk> she offers those intrigued by the geisha tradition a glimpse into their <unk> world by hosting <unk> and offering visitors the chance to watch them practice their arts
her initial fascination with geisha came when working as a filmmaker pitching a documentary on the subject
she <unk> the detachment gained through a camera lens claiming that only by becoming one herself could she really get to know their traditions and skills
i couldn't just take one step into it i had to totally embrace it it was the only way she says
the geisha world is <unk> very beautiful and with a very beautiful lifestyle she says explaining what first attracted her to a very different life
but really to live a beautiful life in any country is not so easy she adds hinting at the challenges she faced becoming one of the few western women to live as a geisha in japan
for most visitors to japan attracted by the mystery of the geisha industry <unk> tours may be as close as they will get to experience an authentic geisha experience
an <unk> entertainment at a <unk> consists of a multi course meal with <unk> for dances singing or music played on traditional instruments like the <unk> a three <unk> <unk> <unk> a traditional japanese <unk>
traditionally geisha would specialize in one art form and spend their careers improving their craft
aside from a few twenty one st century <unk> like an ipod <unk> to the dancing <unk> says that the scene at one of her hosted dinners would not have changed much for four hundred years
if you come to a <unk> you get to experience the most beautiful parts of japanese culture the best of japanese cuisine
there really is no other way to experience it all in one space
while <unk> is something of frontier in the country for geisha culture the rest of the year <unk> is based in tokyo's <unk> district and also travels to host geisha <unk> abroad
for centuries <unk> have worked as <unk> and paid companions
the most literal translation of geisha is simply artist
different districts in japanese cities have varying training regimen for geisha but typically as in kyoto exams are taken after the first year as an <unk> with four additional years of <unk>
many operate within geisha houses <unk> for <unk> geisha that help manage their careers while also providing a unique bond and atmosphere of <unk>
with each <unk> crafted <unk> costing thousands of dollars being affiliated with a geisha house helps <unk> geisha absorb the costs
after a year's training at a geisha house in tokyo's <unk> district <unk> now operates as an independent
she says she was denied the chance to take on the position of geisha mother and mentor young geisha affiliated with the geisha house she trained with because she is not japanese
along with kyoto the <unk> district has a long tradition of geisha enabling visitors today to easily <unk> in some geisha spotting as they walk through streets on the way to functions at local <unk> and restaurants
it's become something of a tourist <unk> in kyoto
there are now organized walking tours something that many within in the community have criticized as being too intrusive
for some the <unk> of geisha culture goes against its very nature
<unk> is part of the deal with <unk> says author <unk> <unk> who spent six months living in <unk> geisha district while researching her book geisha
the remarkable truth behind the fiction
people want to <unk> it but as a tourist you won't see the pristine experience you'll get an experience but it just won't be the same
i think those that work in the geisha industry are very good at hiding
for <unk> geisha remain the embodiment of <unk> and grace and are still the <unk> of the traditional japanese art forms
and far from being painted <unk> their role as artists and professional companions makes them rather formidable believes <unk>
these are really impressive women
walking down the street with them i felt really proud
the arizona republican made the remark after protesters rushed a senate armed services committee witness table where ninety one year old henry kissinger the secretary of state under president richard nixon was testifying
mccain the committee's chairman ordered them escorted from the room by capitol police
he said the protesters one of whom held handcuffs above <unk> head put him in danger of being harmed
these people were physically threatening henry kissinger mccain told cnn's dana bash sunday on state of the union as he defended his comments
i'm used to people popping up at these hearings and yelling and then they're escorted out that's at least some version of free speech he said
these people rushed up
they were right next to henry kissinger waving handcuffs at him
he's a ninety one year old man with a broken shoulder who was willing to come down and testify before congress to give us the benefit of his many years of wisdom
of course i was outraged and i'm still outraged
obama also cautioned against the risk of <unk> the threat of terror groups and said the u.s. should instead align itself with the overwhelming majority of muslims who reject the radical ideology and tactics of terrorist groups like isis and al qaeda
i don't <unk> with labels
i think we all recognize that this is a particular problem that has roots in muslim communities obama said in an interview with cnn's fareed zakaria
but i think we do ourselves a disservice in this fight if we are not taking into account the fact that the overwhelming majority of muslims reject this ideology
republicans have criticized obama in recent weeks for refusing to label the terror threat the u.s. and the west faces as islamic extremism or rooted in radical islam
obama stuck to condemning the terrorism and violent extremism in the wake of terror attacks in sydney and paris carried out by jihadists
we are in a religious war with radical islamists sen. lindsey graham proclaimed on fox news earlier this month
when i hear the president of the united states and his chief spokesperson failing to admit that we're in a religious war it really <unk> me
but obama said the u.s. needs to be wary of handing terrorists the victory of <unk> their actions and the threat they pose to the u.s
obama emphasized that while he is mindful of the terrible costs of terrorism terror groups aren't an existential threat to the united states or the world order

obama says netanyahu's visit is too close to the israeli election for a meeting
the truth of the matter is that they can do harm
but we have the capacity to control how we respond in ways that do not undercut what's the essence of who we are
that means that we don't torture for example and thereby undermine our values and credibility around the world obama said
it means that we don't approach this with a strategy of sending out occupying armies and playing whack a <unk> wherever a terrorist group appears because that <unk> our economic strength and it puts enormous burdens on our military
the u.s. needs to instead keep its response surgical obama said to address the specific threat the u.s. faces without alienating the majority of muslims who are peaceful and reject extremism those who have embraced a <unk> violent almost medieval interpretation of islam

these investments will increase infrastructure funding by over a third support hundreds of thousands of american jobs and lay the foundations for long term economic growth the official
the infrastructure push comes as the president is set to unveil his two thousand and sixteen budget in a speech at the department of homeland security in washington on monday
both republicans and democrats have cited transportation needs as well as tax reform as priorities for the upcoming fiscal year
still the white house tax proposal aimed at foreign profits for u.s. companies is far more ambitious than what gop lawmakers now in control of congress are likely to approve
continuing the obama administration's efforts to crackdown on foreign tax shelters the white house proposal would put in place a one time fourteen percents transition tax on the foreign earnings already accumulated overseas
the white house estimates that this revenue along with money from the highway trust fund would fully finance a six year infrastructure investment plan as part of obama's proposal
in the future the u.s. would also apply a nineteen percents tax rate on new foreign earnings while providing a credit for foreign taxes already paid under the administration's plan
the reformed system would close loopholes that allow u.s. companies to shift profits to tax havens and avoid paying tax on them for years or forever the white house official said
the new chairman of the house ways and means committee rep. paul ryan r wisconsin a frequent critic of the president's economic policies said in an interview on sunday that he is interested in working with the administration as well as democrats in congress to find some fiscal common ground
we want to work with the administration to see if we can find common ground on certain aspects of tax reform and exhaust that possibility
if and when that possibility is exhausted then we will put out what we think ought to be done ryan said on nbc's meet the press on sunday
we really believe that we should reform the entire tax code for all people individuals families businesses simpler the whole thing
but it is pretty clear to us that the president doesn't agree with that on individuals ryan said
on the latter he said i love them both
the president joined nbc's savannah guthrie in the white house kitchen ahead of the game for a traditional five minute pre game interview
they touched on more serious topics like the state of the union and whether or not he walked in to the capitol with too much swagger
obama defended the tone of his speech saying he was telling the american people about the success that america has had in digging itself out of a really tough recession and that is a celebration of the american people that's not about politics
my job is to present the right ideas and if republicans think they have a better idea than they should present them he said
but my job is not to <unk> my sails and not tell the american people what we should be doing pretending somehow that we don't need better roads or we don't need more affordable college
the president said he has found over six years in office that when i tell the american people very clearly what direction i think the country should go in sometimes people change their minds and even republicans occasionally start agreeing with me
just not as quickly as he would like obama said
at the end of the interview the host gave the president a <unk> <unk> of either or questions
when asked if he would pick football or basketball the president was ever the politician saying i'm still a basketball guy but i love football
on offense or defense always offense
and on buffalo wings or chips and <unk> he said you know that's tough but i'm gon na go with chips and <unk>
and again on hillary clinton or joe biden obama didn't skip a beat saying love them both
good try
but the most memorable moment of the interview may just be a photograph of obama <unk> some beer with his <unk> up

it left manager <unk> <unk> satisfied with his team's efforts
i think two zero was a fair result he said
in the first half we had four chances and we scored two which was okay
the second half we didn't have many but they didn't have a shot on target either

for the first time in more than a month demonstrators peacefully took to the roads many said to make their voices heard and let their government and the world know that their fight for universal suffrage continues
joshua wong eighteen one of the student leaders of the movement was one familiar face in the crowd
this rally is to let people know the umbrella movement is not over wong said referencing the iconic symbol chosen by the demonstrators when they occupied the streets of hong kong for two and a half months late last year
the turnout though fell far short of expectations even for organizers
while the group behind the march the civil human rights front had forecast fifty thousand people to join they estimated only thirteen thousand took part in the procession
a spokeswoman for the hong kong police force put that number at just eight thousand eight hundred
while admitting some disappointment <unk> chan with the civil human rights front was still upbeat saying the march had achieved its main goal
to remind the hong kong government that the reform proposal currently on the table for the two thousand and seventeen election doesn't go far enough
in the coming days i think people will try to give more political pressure not only through demonstration but civil disobedience in order to fight for true democracy chan said
dennis <unk> a nineteen year old student who joined the march called it half successful because new groups had joined
some of them planned to meet after the rally to <unk> the next steps said joshua wong and other students
but it's unclear where this movement which drew over one hundred thousand protesters at its peak in two thousand and fourteen goes from here without a clear leader or strategy to achieve its aims
as hong kong works through the process of how its top leader will be elected in two thousand and seventeen the government has asked for feedback during a two month period of public consultations
but hong kong's leaders including chief executive <unk> <unk> have made it clear that there are limits
reform must be within the framework outlined by beijing
that framework has hong kong's next leader being directly elected for the first time but notes that the candidates for the ballot will be screened by a nominating committee
the government responded to sunday's protest march with a statement on its website
the calls on all sectors of the community to adopt an accommodating rational and pragmatic approach as well as an inclusive attitude to express views to forge consensus so that five million eligible voters can elect the chief executive by universal suffrage through one person one vote in two thousand and seventeen

he also called homosexuality part of a lifestyle like drinking and swearing
the former arkansas governor winner of the two thousand and eight iowa caucuses and likely two thousand and sixteen <unk> comments came during an appearance sunday on cnn's state of the union as he defended an excerpt from his new book in which he says he has friends and associates who are gay
people can be my friends who have lifestyles that are not necessarily my lifestyle
i don't shut people out of my circle or out of my life because they have a different point of view huckabee told cnn's dana bash while deflecting a question about whether he believes being gay is a choice
i don't drink alcohol but gosh a lot of my friends maybe most of them do
you know i don't use profanity but believe me i've got a lot of friends who do
some people really like classical music and ballet and opera it's not my cup of tea huckabee said
he also offered a nod to legislation that some conservatives have advocated on the national and state levels protecting businesses from discrimination claims for adhering to their owners religious views
i'd like to think that there's room in america for people who have different points of view without screaming and shouting and wanting to shut their businesses down he said
what worries me in this new environment we're in it's not just that someone might disagree they don't want to argue with me even take a different point of view
they want to close someone's business down
huckabee pointed to president barack obama's two thousand and eight opposition to same sex marriage but said there's no chance he'll ever drop his opposition to gay marriage
this is not just a political issue
it is a biblical issue
and as a biblical issue unless i get a new version of the <unk> it's really not my place to say ok i'm just going to evolve huckabee said
it's like asking someone who's jewish to start serving bacon wrapped shrimp in their <unk>
we don't want to do that i mean we're not going to do that
or like asking a muslim to serve up something that is offensive to him or to have dogs in his backyard he said
we're so sensitive to make sure we don't offend certain religions but then we act like christians can't have the convictions that they've had for two thousand years
since then the united states has provided advisers to the iraqi military in its fight with isis and has bombed isis positions
but in an interview with cnn last week outgoing defense secretary chuck hagel raised the prospect that the united states might need to expand its involvement
this week isis has again dominated headlines and tv news coverage around the world with the release of a video allegedly showing jordanian pilot <unk> al kaseasbeh being burned alive after being captured by the group
this followed shortly after the apparent killing of two japanese hostages
all of which raises the question
how is isis doing as it <unk> the u.s. led military campaign against it in both iraq and syria
and should the united states get more actively involved on the front lines of the fight at least in iraq where the government is pushing for greater american involvement in its fight against isis
u.s. officials assert the coalition has killed more than six thousand isis fighters since the start of the campaign
that's a significant loss when you consider that isis currently has a core force of nine thousand to eighteen thousand fighters according to u.s. intelligence estimates
u.s. officials also estimate that isis can also draw on manpower from other militant groups to bulk up to a force of around thirty thousand
gen lloyd austin the commander of u.s. central command who oversees the campaign against isis said last week that as a result of the campaign of airstrikes the group is developing a manpower issue
balanced against this however is the fact isis continues to recruit at a fast clip
in october u.s. officials estimated that there were around one thousand recruits joining isis per month from overseas
<unk> the importance of that steady flow of isis recruits the head of u.s. special operations command gen. joseph l. <unk> said last week that since the syrian war began over three years ago more than nineteen thousand foreign fighters from ninety different countries have traveled to syria and iraq
so if the centcom campaign is killing around one thousand two hundred isis fighters a month and yet isis continues at least for the moment to recruit an estimated one thousand fighters from overseas a month the campaign against them has succeeded only to a modest degree
hagel told cnn's barbara starr last week it might be necessary to send noncombat american troops to help iraqi troops on the front lines to fight isis
we have to look at all the options and i think it may require a forward deployment of some of our troops not doing the fighting not doing the combat work that we did at one time for six years in iraq and we did for many many years in afghanistan but to help airstrike precision he told starr
indeed the introduction of american forward air controllers to call in precise u.s. airstrikes and of u.s. special forces embedded with iraqi units on the front lines will ultimately be necessary if the goal of american policy is to defeat isis rather than simply playing for a draw with the group which is de facto the current obama administration policy
on friday isis launched a surprise attack on kirkuk in northern iraq the largely kurdish city that is a key to iraq's oil production
the attack appears to be a strategic decision meant to draw kurdish fighters away from mosul isis's overall base in iraq
isis has controlled mosul iraq's second largest city since june but in the past month kurdish forces have closed in around it
kurdish authorities said last week that they've cut a key supply line to isis in mosul and have taken back some three hundred square miles of land around the city from the group
beyond the mosul area isis has lost ground in iraq elsewhere
the iraqi army pushed the group out of diyala province an important region close to baghdad as well as more than one thousand square miles in the sinjar region in eastern iraq
further a number of isis's leaders have been killed in u.s. airstrikes
and in syria last week isis lost control of kobani a small town on the syrian turkish border where many of the us led airstrikes have been concentrated
but overall isis is maintaining its ground in syria in spite of those airstrikes
at least one third of syria is under isis's control
a number of estimates suggest that isis controls a population of around eight million people in iraq and syria
isis calls itself the islamic state and while this may seem a <unk> <unk> it makes more sense when you realize the group <unk> <unk> over a population around the size of the population of switzerland
at the same time isis's influence keeps growing around the muslim world
in the past six months isis has drawn into its fold some dozen militant groups from algeria to pakistan
these affiliates aren't wasting any time in carrying out attacks in the name of isis
on january twenty seven gunmen claiming to be affiliated with isis attacked the corinthia hotel in tripoli libya which is favored by government officials and foreigners
they killed ten people after <unk> into the lobby and firing guns at hotel guests
five of the victims were foreigners one an american
two days later at least thirty two people were killed in a series of attacks on soldiers and police in sinai in eastern egypt
the terrorist group known as the province of sinai has claimed responsibility for the attacks and had pledged allegiance to isis in november
isis has recently claimed even more recruits as it moved into new territory in yemen competing there with al qaeda in the arabian peninsula
a yemeni official who spoke to cnn in january said that the aqap cadre still significantly <unk> those in isis but the move into yemen is significant for the group as it a country where al qaeda has maintained a presence for more than a decade
similarly in afghanistan in the southern province of helmand a cell of more than three hundred fighters loyal to isis is led by a former taliban commander <unk> abdul <unk> <unk>
militant groups across the muslim world see the success isis has had so far in syria and iraq and opt to join it often leaving behind organizations plagued by infighting
the perks they get in return for waving the black flag of isis include affiliation with the fastest growing terrorist group on the planet and a bustling propaganda machine with a strong social media network
from afghanistan to libya militant groups who once would have looked to al qaeda for guidance now look to isis
the best way to begin to reverse this is to <unk> isis in iraq where the group has shown itself to be the most adept terrorist group of the modern era taking control of cities like mosul whose population numbers one point five million people
urban warfare is the hardest kind of warfare and it's hard to imagine that the iraqi army and kurdish forces will successfully pull off <unk> mosul on their own
winning mosul back from isis will be much more likely if the there are american air controllers calling in close air support strikes against isis positions and u.s. special forces working side by side with iraqi units
of course there are risks associated with this
u.s. troops may be killed or injured but there are also risks associated with the fact that the longer isis controls vast swaths of the middle east more and more foreign fighters will pour in from western countries for training with the group and some will seek to bring their skills home to attack the west
i sort of dreamed about it quietly not daring to think about it too much she said monday grinning as she described her relief at learning her son was released from prison and safely out of egypt
australian al jazeera journalist peter greste had been behind bars since december two thousand and thirteen
on sunday family members learned he was finally free
i'm ecstatic you know i just can't say how happy i am about it all his mother said
i'm very excited and pleased and thank goodness this is all over
but as they thanked government officials journalists and supporters around the world for helping push for his freedom the greste family also told reporters at a press briefing in australia on monday that there's more to be done
on a more somber note we also and i know peter sincerely wanted me to mention this point we want to acknowledge that peter's two other colleagues are still there andrew greste said
they also deserve to be freed
peter won't rest until they're released from prison and we hope that will follow in the very near future
all three were convicted of supporting the banned muslim brotherhood but have maintained their innocence
al jazeera demanded their release as did a chorus of many other international journalists
egypt's highest court recently accepted the appeal of the three journalists and granted them a retrial
on sunday morning greste's family started to hear rumors that something might happen then checked with their contacts
it seemed like it could be true
but egypt is a very uncertain and unpredictable place and until he was on that plane anything could have happened
he wasn't out of there until he was out of there andrew greste said
now peter greste is in <unk> gathering his thoughts his brother said
he's safe healthy and very very happy to be on his way home
after his release family members said he enjoyed a meal of beer and pork
now his family members say they're giving him time to figure out where he'll go and what he'll do next
he needs that space to start with lois greste said but we're sure he's going to be fine
australian foreign minister julie bishop said greste had been released unconditionally but will need some time to adjust to life outside prison
he was somewhat bewildered
he was only given short notice by egyptian authorities that he was to be released unconditionally
we moved as fast as we could to collect him from the prison and escort him to the airport and make arrangements for his immediate departure she said he will make his way home in his own time
i think he wants a little bit of rest and recreation but he also wants to be reunited with his family and friends as soon as possible
greste left egypt around four p.m. local time sunday egyptian interior ministry spokesman <unk> abdel <unk> said
but one of greste's lawyers suggested there could be more legal issues ahead for greste
according to egyptian law this is considered an extradition lawyer <unk> <unk> said
peter must be tried in australia and authorities there must determine if he is guilty or not
al <unk> the managing director of al jazeera english said he spoke with greste earlier sunday
the journalist sounded strong
he sounded immensely relieved perhaps not celebratory but immensely relieved <unk> told cnn's reliable sources
<unk> sought to keep attention on fahmy and mohamed
it's very unclear what's happening to baher and what's happening for mohamed he said
but we just need to bring this injustice to an end and to get them out
at the time of their arrest in december two thousand and thirteen egypt was mired in political turmoil surrounding the removal by coup of president mohamed morsy in his muslim brotherhood backed government
after morsy was ousted the longstanding political party was declared a terrorist organization by the military which had staged the coup
greste described in a january two thousand and fourteen letter how he and his colleagues were detained saying that interior ministry officials burst into a hotel room that he and fahmy were using
officials rushed baher <unk> home he said
i am nervous as i write this the letter read
i am in my cold prison cell after my first official exercise session four glorious hours in the grass yard behind our block and i don't want that right to be snatched away
that is why i have sought until now to fight my imprisonment quietly from within to make the authorities understand that this is all a terrible mistake that i've been caught in the middle of a political struggle that is not my own he wrote
but after two weeks in prison it is now clear that this is a dangerous decision
it <unk> an attack not just on me and my two colleagues but on freedom of speech across egypt
read the letter greste wrote while in prison
amnesty international and other observers have long held that greste fahmy and mohamed were <unk> in a geopolitical dispute between egypt and qatar the small middle eastern country that finances al jazeera
qatar has long been perceived as a supporter of the muslim brotherhood
egypt is the sixth leading <unk> of journalists in the world according to a census the non partisan committee to protect journalists took in december two thousand and fourteen
the jailing and sentencing of the al jazeera journalists generated outrage from colleagues and activists around the world
a campaign led by al jazeera declared that journalism is not a crime
many tweeted under the hashtag <unk> and journalists including cnn's chief international correspondent christiane amanpour who held up a sign with the campaign on her show
on sunday <unk> called on egyptian president abdel fattah al sisi to pardon and release greste's al jazeera colleagues mohamed fahmy and baher mohamed and the other journalists still behind bars for doing their work
human rights watch did the same
al sisi issued a law last november giving him the power to deport foreign defendants
it brought hope to two of the al jazeera defendants families but stoked concerns for others
greste is australian
fahmy who used to work for cnn has dual nationality with egyptian canadian citizenship
mohamed is egyptian
some worried that the case would lose its international appeal if greste and fahmy were released leaving the egyptian defendant behind bars
<unk> <unk> baher <unk> wife told cnn that she couldn't believe greste has been released
why him and not her egyptian husband
because they were all three in the same case i don't know only one got released
i don't know why they released him now after a year
what's special about this timing
she demanded
are the foreigners more important in our country
we used to hear that the three would be pardoned but does this mean that only foreigners will be released
<unk> is worried but optimistic because she's confident that greste will tell the world that their imprisonment is unjust she said
no one will be silent
we won't be silent she said
peter won't be silent
<unk> said that releasing greste proves that the case isn't about terrorism as the egyptian government claimed but about targeting journalists
was doing his job she said
he was <unk> news saying what the muslim brotherhood said and what the government said
do i need to explain what a journalist should do
<unk> mother <unk> abdel hamid <unk> appealed to al sisi in a statement that an egyptian news outlet published sunday telling the president that her son is ill with hepatitis c and an injured shoulder
as a mother and an egyptian citizen i appeal to you mr. president abdel fattah al sisi to pardon my son
it hurts me to see his health deteriorating while i have little access to him she wrote
my father and uncles have served in the highest ranks of the police force and the military
they have spent their lives defending egypt
it breaks my heart that the son of a patriotic family like ours has been wrongfully framed as a terrorist in a trial that produced no evidence to the accusations
islamist extremists tried to enter maiduguri the capital of borno state during a <unk> attack after the army fought them off last week

boko haram gunmen have been routed and are on the run said <unk> <unk> another resident
soldiers repelled attacks in maiduguri on january twenty five but the extremists seized the nearby town of monguno and its military barracks
both cities are near the chad and cameroon borders which would give the militants an entry point into those countries
monguno and its military post had served as a buffer to keep the militants away from maiduguri
its fall left maiduguri vulnerable to capture by the militants
borno gov

the youths sacrificed their lives and moved to <unk> to support our <unk> armed forces in a patriotic battle to defend the soul of borno state and its people from being seized by determined insurgents he said in a statement
i am confident that as a people we can overcome the threat of insurgents shettima said
borno is our land we can not and we must not allow anyone push us out of our land
the governor said he is not asking citizens to take justice into their own hands but to register and get training to support the military
the latest attacks come as nigeria prepares for elections february fourteen
u.s. secretary of state john kerry was in the nation last month to call for peaceful voting
in neighboring yobe state a suicide blast sunday outside the home of a prominent politician killed seven people and injured several others a police officer and witnesses said
<unk> <unk> a candidate of nigeria's ruling peoples democratic party was not injured in the explosion
it occurred while he was holding a meeting with his campaign team at his home in <unk> town
we were outside the house when a bus pulled over and an <unk> man was pushed out said <unk> <unk> who was among a crowd of supporters outside the home at the time of the blast
the bus drove off and before anybody realized what was happening the man exploded

boko haram has terrorized northern nigeria regularly since two thousand and nine attacking police schools churches and civilians as well as bombing government buildings

one beat sixth seed andy murray seven six six seven six three six zero in a contentious <unk> in melbourne he become only the second man to claim five australian open titles
and with djokovic twenty seven odds are that he'll match roy emerson's record haul of six
emerson was in attendance sunday along with other australian tennis legends including rod laver
i love my time being here djokovic told reporters
being mentioned in the elite group of legends in our sport is a huge privilege and honor
i can't say how proud i am
that's going to serve definitely only as a great deal of inspiration for the rest of my career
this was the third time djokovic downed the scot in a final at melbourne park and how murray will be <unk> blowing a lead in the third set
mind you djokovic let slip a four two advantage in the second set and thus might have won in three if not for a lapse
djokovic looked spent physically early in the second and in the opening stages of the third by which time the two had been on court for almost three hours
he <unk> on his feet struggled to get serves in play and went to ground after a rally
not that murray wanted to buy into any of it
he felt the serb was <unk> and could be heard <unk> on court about his friend
don't worry about him he does it all the time
murray though did let it get to him
he obviously looked like he was in quite a bad way at the beginning of the third set and came back unbelievable at the end of that set murray told reporters afterward
then obviously the way he was hitting the ball in the fourth and moving was impressive
if it was <unk> how he recovered from it that's a tough thing to recover from and play as well as he did at the end
so yeah i'm frustrated at myself for letting that bother me at the beginning of the third set because i was playing well i had good momentum and then just dropped off for like ten minutes and it got away from me
djokovic overturned a two zero hole in the third and saved a break point at three three when he struck a drop volley that forced murray into an error
djokovic immediately urged the crowd to back him and they did
energized he didn't lose another game to collect his eighth major overall to join among others murray's former coach ivan lendl
a cool handshake at the net after roughly four hours of play followed
murray too didn't laugh during the trophy presentation when new dad djokovic wished him and fiancee kim <unk> many kids in the future
djokovic denied he was <unk> injury or trying to throw murray off his game
the length of the rallies and the <unk> that we had in the first two sets have taken an energy from me djokovic said
it's normal to expect that you can't always be you know at your one hundred percents
so you go through some particular moments that you can call crises during matches like these
this is what i had in these fifteen twenty minutes
after that i felt better
if murray wasn't best pleased with <unk> <unk> he should also spare some criticism for his own second serve
against the elite murray's second serve can be the source of trouble and on sunday djokovic captured sixty six percents of those points
djokovic began the final <unk> hitting ten winners and one unforced error to build a commanding four one lead
broken at four two djokovic regained the break but injured his thumb when he slipped near the net
temporarily <unk> djokovic couldn't serve out the set and called for the trainer
a murray double fault at four two in the tiebreak a double fault by murray in a tiebreak in the two thousand and thirteen final was costly and later a missed volley gifted djokovic the first
djokovic won thirteen straight points at one stage in the second set to reverse a break deficit but said a brief stoppage after two protestors ran on court in the middle of the second halted his progression
a strong start from murray in the tiebreak was enough to see him level the affair
by this time he was clearly in the <unk> and needed to put djokovic who had lost five of his previous seven grand slam finals away
the knockout blow never came and djokovic ultimately improved to eight one in his last nine matches against murray
he ended the match as he began it making a <unk> three unforced errors in the fourth
i started hitting the ball more covering the court better <unk> the points said djokovic
yet murray did something this fortnight he wasn't able to achieve last year as he recovered from back surgery land in a grand slam final
we put in a lot of hard work to try to get back in this position after what was a difficult year last year he told the crowd referring to his entourage
unfortunately i couldn't do it tonight but i'm a little bit closer than i was a few months ago and i'll keep working hard to get there

but in doing so japanese journalist kenji goto suffered his own gruesome fate apparently becoming the latest foreigner to be decapitated by isis
a newly distributed video from isis appears to show the beheaded body of goto
it came one week after a video surfaced showing him holding a photo of what appeared to be the corpse of his fellow japanese captive haruna yukawa
just like isis previous beheading videos the sixty seven second footage released saturday was issued by the terror group's media wing al <unk> media
the video can not be <unk> by cnn
and now japan finds itself more deeply embroiled in the global fight against isis
we are deeply saddened by this despicable and horrendous act of terrorism and we denounce it in the strongest terms japanese prime minister shinzo abe said according to broadcaster nhk
to the terrorists we will never never forgive them for this act
the members of the united nations security council said in a statement that they strongly condemned goto's heinous and cowardly murder adding that those responsible should be held accountable
this crime is yet again a tragic reminder of the increasing dangers journalists and others face every day in syria
it also once again demonstrates the brutality of which is responsible for thousands of abuses against the syrian and iraqi people the security council said
u.s. president barack obama said the united states stands in solidarity with japan in denouncing this barbaric act
we applaud japan's steadfast commitment to advancing peace and prosperity in the middle east and globally including its generous assistance for innocent people affected by the conflicts in the region obama said in a statement
unlike the united states britain and other allies japan is not involved in the military campaign against isis
but japan has been providing humanitarian aid in the middle east as isis continues its bloody quest to <unk> an islamic state across parts of iraq and syria
and japan's efforts to provide humanitarian aid won't stop one top official said sunday
we would like to expand our support for refugees chief cabinet secretary yoshihide suga said
we are surely going to have necessary support in terms of not <unk> to terrorism
let the nightmare for japan begin
the isis video opens with a black slate that reads a message to japan
it then shows a kneeling goto
the man known as jihadi john is standing behind him
the terrorist speaks in english while holding a knife in his left hand
abe because of your reckless decision to take part in an <unk> war this knife will not only slaughter kenji but will also carry on and cause carnage wherever your people are found the man says
so let the nightmare for japan begin
the video cuts to black as the militant puts the knife to goto's throat
it then shows the apparent result of the decapitation
it's not clear who conducted the apparent killing
the knife wielding masked man with a london accent has been nicknamed jihadi john
he has appeared in at least six videos with hostages and has overseen the beheadings of other captives
goto forty seven left japan last fall when his younger daughter was three weeks old
his wife rinko first heard from his captors december two
on january twenty an isis video posted to social media showed goto and yukawa dressed in orange kneeling in front of a masked man dressed in black
in that video the isis militant issued a two hundred million dollar ransom demand to the japanese government in order to free the japanese men within seventy two hours
that's the same amount of money abe recently pledged for those contending with isis
days later a new message surfaced featuring what appeared to be the corpse of yukawa
and goto would also be killed the new message claimed unless jordan freed prisoner and convicted terrorist sajida al rishawi
suga said japan tried hard to save both yukawa and goto
since the beginning of the incident we have been trying to use all kind of means and to do our best to save their lives by using our diplomatic route as much as possible suga said sunday
when asked whether japan negotiated over the ransom suga said no
jordan also said it did everything it could to free goto in cooperation with japan government spokesman mohammed al momani told jordan's official petra news agency sunday
but that country is still grappling with its own hostage situation
among its web of threats isis said it would kill jordanian military pilot captured in syria if jordan doesn't release convicted terrorist al rishawi
but pilot moath al kasasbeh's fate remains unclear
he was not mentioned in the latest video featuring goto
jordan will continue trying to secure the release of the pilot al momani told petra on sunday
but he said officials are still seeking proof of life evidence that al kasasbeh is alive
goto a veteran journalist had said he felt compelled to document the stories of war even if it meant going to some of the most dangerous places in the world
syrian people suffering for three years and a half
it's enough he said in a video shot in october
so i would like to get the story of what isis wants to do
in a statement posted on the website of goto's media company his family thanked those who had prayed for his safe return and said they were deeply saddened by his death
goto's mother junko ishido said her son wanted to help create a world free of wars
i'm shedding tears of sorrow i just can't think of any words to say she said according to nhk
but i don't want this sorrow to create a chain of hatred
while feeling a great personal loss i remain extremely proud of my husband who reported the plight of people in conflict areas like iraq somalia and syria she said
it was his passion to highlight the effects on ordinary people especially through the eyes of children and to inform the rest of us of the tragedies of war

that price was well above christie's auction house estimated value of seven hundred and sixty dollar to one thousand two hundred dollar
this week however the <unk> price jumped dramatically one thousand times its previous value at a sotheby's auction in new york
the discrepancy in the value of <unk> cathedral from the <unk> is due to a difference of opinion by art experts at the rival auction houses
christie's analyzed the painting in two thousand and thirteen and declared that it was the work of a follower of john constable not a creation of the famed english romantic landscape artist himself
but sotheby's claimed it was an original constable made in preparation for another work owned by the <unk> gallery in london
the auction house valued the painting at between two million dollar and three million dollar
anne <unk> former eighteen th and nineteen th century british art curator at the <unk> wrote in catalog for the sotheby's auction that the present work by constable was heavily <unk> with a dark and opaque <unk> which probably dated to the late nineteen th or early twenty th century in a misguided attempt to finish the painting
<unk> wrote that this was the reason why christie's overlooked its authenticity in two thousand and thirteen
the <unk> on the present painting were readily <unk> in the course of its recent cleaning and <unk> original and brilliant conception has been once again revealed <unk> wrote
christie's however said that experts disagree about the <unk> authenticity
we are aware that sotheby's have sold this work as by constable the auction house said in a statement
we took the view at the time of our sale in two thousand and thirteen that it was by a follower of
we understand that there is no clear consensus of expertise on the new <unk>
<unk> wrote that the painting recently sold was one of five preliminary oil sketches <unk> to perhaps the greatest of his late <unk> a work that goes by the same name
according to sotheby's it is believed the sketch was possibly sold by the artist in one thousand eight hundred and thirty seven for six pounds or about nine dollar today

the pangolin is now a little safer because of you
last year after i wrote about the illegal trade in these artichoke shaped scale covered mammals cnn digital readers donated more than twenty thousand dollar toward the shooting and production of an anti pangolin poaching public service announcement and media campaign
the <unk> is now airing in vietnam which is a hub of the illegal trade
hosted by a vietnamese <unk> the advertisement is expected to be seen on sixty national and provincial television channels in the country and is airing on at least twenty stations as of this week according to education for nature vietnam a environmental non profit that commissioned the <unk>
our native species the pangolin is being threatened by hunters and traders who defy the law to profit from nature regardless of the cost to <unk> environment the <unk> <unk> <unk> who was described to me as the female anderson cooper of vietnam says in the clip
she continues
if you buy pangolin scales or eat pangolin meat in restaurants you are directly supporting these criminal networks
the <unk> ends with a call to action asking viewers to call a <unk> to report illegal wildlife crime
pangolin scales are used in traditional medicine and were openly available in markets when i visited vietnam in february two thousand and fourteen
pangolin meat a <unk> was easy to spot on restaurant menus in <unk>
in an effort to curb demand education for nature vietnam also has posted banners in markets telling people that buying and selling pangolin scales is illegal and that the scales are not a magic medicine said doug <unk> the group's chief technical adviser
we've always focused on tigers rhinos and bears and now <unk> we're really <unk> <unk> which is great said <unk>
radio spots are in the works as well
all of this was funded by the cnn reader donations he said
the pangolin a scale covered mammal that resembles an <unk> and rolls up into a ball when it's threatened is thought by conservationists to be the most <unk> mammal in the world
i reported on this little known creature last year after cnn digital readers voted for me to cover illegal wildlife trafficking as part of my change the list project
the <unk> celebrity has been increasing as of late
<unk> the maker of angry birds featured them in a mobile game
and prince william helped raise awareness about their plight in a november youtube video
the humble pangolin a <unk> <unk> is one of the most endangered animals because of poaching the prince said
the pangolin runs the risk of going extinct before most people have even heard of him
enforcement efforts also give cause for hope
this month police in zimbabwe arrested five pangolin poachers according to <unk>
and in june two tons of pangolin scales were seized in hong kong according to that non profit group
if the pangolin is saved it will be in part thanks to those efforts and yours
so here's another heartfelt thanks to those of you who contributed to education for nature <unk> anti poaching <unk> and who took time to read and care about this bizarre but important little animal
i hope this public service announcement opens minds and that similar work is soon be taken up in china which is researchers say is another large market for pangolin products
the new spanish party podemos aims for a repeat of the greek scenario in spain with some polls already show it ahead of the incumbent conservatives and the main opposition <unk> for national elections due later this year
podemos which means we can held its march for change at midday filling the spanish capital's emblematic <unk> del <unk> square and adjacent streets
it's the same place where anti austerity protests began four years ago during a deep economic crisis and podemos is seen partly as an <unk> of that movement which leveraged social media to further its message
a leading newspaper el <unk> reported that spanish authorities estimated about one hundred thousand people took part on saturday while podemos put the figure at three hundred thousand
el <unk> own estimate based on people density along the oft used protest route was about one hundred and fifty thousand
whatever the number it was considered a strong opening shot by pablo <unk> the leader of podemos which formed only a year ago
he said saturday's protest would start the countdown on spain's conservative prime minister <unk> <unk> whose party has labeled podemos as a supposedly dangerous choice that can't possibly deliver on its promises
<unk> was in athens just before the greek elections to support syriza the anti austerity party that would go on to win
syriza's leader alex tsipras was in madrid late last year when podemos officially designated <unk> as its leader
both parties in greece and spain have insisted that there should be fresh negotiations on how to pay the large debts their countries incurred during the economic crisis
the debts and rolling back the austerity measures have been a key focus of both parties
podemos last year won five seats for spain in the european parliament considered a strong showing for a newcomer
its first electoral test at home comes in may in spanish regional and local elections and then in national elections due toward the end of the year

the image was snapped at miami international airport not at <unk> <unk> international airport outside the venezuelan capital by miami herald staffer carl <unk> in november two thousand and thirteen the newspaper said
wyss beaming smile came when he finally arrived on american soil after his detention while reporting about contraband in the border town of san <unk> in the state of <unk>
venezuelan authorities at the time said he was detained for failing to have the proper media credentials the miami herald reported friday
but <unk> officials apparently believed it was a fitting image to promote tourism in a south american nation where chronic shortages of basic goods had led to protests
the hashtag of the twitter campaign was <unk> or we love venezuela
on twitter on thursday wyss seemed somewhat <unk>

<unk> has me in <unk> using <unk> from when i got out of venezuela after forty eight <unk> detention
numerous attempts to reach <unk> for comment were unsuccessful

mohammad <unk> the officer in charge of the police station in the area of the nation's capital were the fire occurred said authorities had sent at least thirteen bodies to a hospital morgue
many of the bodies were <unk> and charred beyond recognition
a short time earlier dhaka police chief <unk> mia told reporters about the efforts to find others who were in the five story building
the rescuers were still searching for bodies in the debris mia said
such factories making products for a number of western retailers play a big part in <unk> economy with ready made garments alone making up eighty percents of the country's twenty four billion dollar in annual exports
the factory that burned saturday was used to make plastic goods
these buildings haven't always proven to be the safest places to work
there are many examples in recent years of fatal factory fires in bangladesh the most glaring being the spring two thousand and thirteen collapse of a nine story building that housed five garment factories
more than one thousand one hundred people died in that blaze
saturday's fire started on the plastic <unk> ground floor and immediately and quickly spread fueled by <unk> chemicals in the building firefighters said
authorities didn't say how many people were in the building when this happened and thus how many remained unaccounted for
yet some of those escaped and there were many estimated about eighty or ninety others worked there
afterward the scene filled with not only firefighters but several thousand onlookers some of them trying to track down their still missing relatives
firefighters didn't specify exactly what caused the blaze though they suspected a busted gas <unk> may be to blame
past factory fires have led to emotional rhetoric from officials calls for action and in some cases criminal charges
thirteen people were found guilty of gross negligence of safety measures and charged with culpable homicide after a november two thousand and twelve <unk> factory fire on <unk> outskirts that killed at least one hundred and seventeen people and spurred others to jump from the building to escape the flames
most of those dead in that blaze were women almost half of them burned so bad that dna tests were needed to identify them
the building collapse months later in dhaka was even more appalling and exponentially more deadly
that blaze spurred widespread criticism about the state of workers rights in bangladesh
the government responded by <unk> laws so that workers no longer need approval from employers to form trade unions and every factory that sells within the country also has to pledge five percents of their profits toward a workers welfare fund
the government also boosted minimum wages from thirty eight dollar to around sixty eight dollar per month

the referee blew the final whistle a full fifteen seconds before the end and had to be escorted down the tunnel by armed police as tunisian players and officials chasing him down the tunnel <unk> what ranks as the finest moment in the country's soccer history
the hosts are ranked one hundred and eighteen th in the world by fifa and were not scheduled to even compete in the tournament
equatorial guinea had initially been thrown out of qualification in the first round back in may two thousand and fourteen after <unk> an <unk> player
several matches during their attempt to qualify for the two thousand and fourteen world cup were also awarded to the opposition for the same reason
but the ebola crisis that has engulfed west africa led to fears in morocco the original host country that fans might bring the disease with them
after a lengthy <unk> they eventually pulled out at the last minute
equatorial guinea who co hosted in two thousand and twelve stepped in and were <unk>
the build up to the tie had seen the hosts <unk> the spirit of the denmark national team of the early one thousand nine hundred and ninety s
denmark failed to qualify for the one thousand nine hundred and ninety two european championships but after yugoslavia were ejected due to the civil war raging in their country the danes were given a free pass into the tournament
they went on to win it
we have the will to win and we like the challenge in front of us
we are hungry for victory equatorial guinea's coach <unk> becker said in a press conference earlier in the tournament
denmark were <unk> in the one thousand nine hundred and ninety two european championship at the last minute and they went on to win it
we want to do that too
yet that denmark team although in decline was still considered to be one of europe's most cultured teams
equatorial guinea were one of the lowest ranked teams in the africa cup of nations
they will now play the winner of ghana and guinea who play sunday
the democratic republic of congo also made it to the semifinals after a dramatic four two victory over congo

he has appeared in at least six videos with hostages
the fate of a jordanian pilot captured by isis in syria moath al kasasbeh was unclear
he is not mentioned in the video
isis had been demanding that jordan exchange a convicted terrorist sajida al rishawi for the pilot
if there was no swap isis said it would kill al kaseasbeh first then goto
goto would be the second japanese hostage to be killed by isis recently
a video file posted online a week ago by a known isis supporter shows an image of goto holding a photo of what appeared to be the corpse of his fellow captive haruna yukawa
we stand today in solidarity with prime minister abe and the japanese people in denouncing this barbaric act the president said in a written statement
we applaud japan's steadfast commitment to advancing peace and prosperity in the middle east and globally including its generous assistance for innocent people affected by the conflicts in the region
the forty seven year old goto left japan last fall when his youngest daughter was three weeks old
his wife rinko first heard from his captors december two
jordanian officials have said they are willing to swap al rishawi a female jihadist imprisoned in jordan for her role in a two thousand and five suicide bombing at a wedding reception that killed dozens for the pilot
but jordan's key condition is proof that al kaseasbeh is still alive
al kaseasbeh was captured after he ejected from his f sixteen jet last month near raqqa the extremist group's de facto capital in syria
<unk> al kaseasbeh an uncle of the pilot told cnn

instead saturday <unk> dull one one draw between leaders chelsea and current champions manchester city did little more than preserve the status quo
manchester city traveled to west london five points behind chelsea knowing that victory would take a large chunk out of that lead
also traveling was manchester city's frank lampard who until last season played for chelsea and remains their record goal scorer
his controversial move to manchester city when it had been thought he had signed for <unk> team new york city fc had angered many chelsea supporters giving extra <unk> to the clash
but there was little drama in a largely benign encounter with chelsea showing signs of fatigue after their <unk> <unk> against liverpool in the league cup

manchester city quickly <unk> when spain international david silva converted after a rare mistake by chelsea goalkeeper <unk> <unk>
manchester city dominated the second half without creating any more clean cut chances
indeed chelsea would fail to register a single shot on target after their goal
the game did come to life again briefly when lampard came on as a late substitute
despite some boos he was given a largely warm reception back at a club where he scored a record two hundred and eleven goals in all competitions
but lampard couldn't find the breakthrough either as the two teams shared the spoils
they had a big old game <unk> lampard told sky sports after the game referring to wednesday's match against liverpool
it was a good performance all round without the electricity the big games need
chelsea i think accepted the point
after the game lampard was given a standing ovation from the home side something he was denied before leaving in the close season
it felt a bit strange and i was excited about today but a bit nervous too
i knew this would be different lampard said of his return
i was delighted with the reception from both fans he added
they chelsea fans showed complete class by giving me an ovation at the end which i didn't get a chance to see at the end of last season

leicester city scored a <unk> through <unk> <unk> but it was too late for the <unk> club to mount another comeback
liverpool maintained their recent run of good form with a two zero victory against west ham united
west ham have not won at <unk> since one thousand nine hundred and sixty three a game in which england's one thousand nine hundred and sixty six world cup hero geoff <unk> scored twice so little was expected of the visiting side
liverpool eventually took the lead through <unk> sterling but it was the return of striker daniel <unk> that had the <unk> on their feet

all i can recall is all those people who didn't believe in us he added
this is one of the biggest moments in sport for australia because this is an asian tournament that's so difficult to win and a tournament we were never supposed to win with this group of players
the tournament is likely to be <unk> last after a <unk> career in english and international soccer
but <unk> coach <unk> <unk> believes that <unk> still has much to offer the team with qualification for the two thousand and eighteen world cup finals in russia next on the agenda
i'd be surprised <unk> said of <unk> rumored retirement
he's had a fantastic tournament
he hasn't said anything to me
i haven't had any discussion with him about his future and i'd be surprised if i had to because again he was a very important part of our team
if <unk> was part of the past one of the last members of australia's so called golden generation that qualified for three world cup finals in a row then goal scoring hero <unk> <unk> could be the future
he was named player of the tournament having been involved in six goals over the course of the tournament
the victory was also <unk> of australia's decision to join the asian football confederation
up until two thousand and five australia had competed in the <unk> football confederation the smallest of fifa's six <unk> with little in the way of true competition aside from the occasional matches against new zealand
the <unk> also offers just half a qualification spot for the world cup finals
a playoff match against tough opponents in south america or asia
a thirty one zero victory against american <unk> in a qualification match for the two thousand and two world cup finals a world record that still stands today forced australian soccer to focus on joining the afc which they did in two thousand and five
as well as holding asia's most prestigious international title club side sydney <unk> famously won last year's asian champions league final against saudi arabia's al <unk> prompting allegations that not everyone in asian soccer is happy with australia's success
after the <unk> beat the united arab emirates in the semifinal one leading figure appeared to express concern that australia had taken one of the <unk> prized world cup qualification spots yet had given little back in return
yes it is true there are indications that confirm that there is a desire among west asian federations to remove australia from the afc sheikh salman bin ibrahim al <unk> the <unk> president of the afc said in an interview with <unk> newspaper al <unk>
i also know that the arabs are not the only ones that are not convinced with the value of australia staying within the asian football family
sheikh salman later denied the comments saying they had been manipulated
i'm really stunned with the timing to bring this topic out
it's a false topic he told australia's herald sun newspaper
to read a story like this is really sad because there's no truth in it
the success of this tournament has exceeded our expectations
i won't let a story like this affect the success of the tournament we had in australia
after australia's victory sheikh salman was quick to praise the team and the country's hosting of the tournament telling the <unk> website that the competition that has been remarkable in spirit and in passion and we have australia to thank for that
brown twenty one was not breathing when a man identified as her husband and a friend found her at about ten twenty five a.m. inside her <unk> in <unk> georgia said police in the atlanta suburb
they called nine hundred and eleven and performed cpr until public safety officers arrived and took over said police spokeswoman lisa holland
brown was taken to north <unk> hospital where she is still alive and breathing
other than that i don't know her condition holland said saturday afternoon at a press briefing
nobody knows what caused brown's <unk> holland said but police consider it a medical incident at this time
she said investigators had found nothing to indicate it was drug or alcohol related
police had been to the residence recently
somebody reported a fight there january twenty three but nobody answered the door and officers found no evidence of an altercation holland told cnn
the police spokeswoman noted one <unk> in the case
her mother died in the very same manner
it was three years ago february eleven that brown's mother renowned singer whitney houston was found dead in a bathtub in the beverly hilton hours before she was to attend a pre <unk> bash there
an autopsy later revealed that she'd drowned <unk> in extremely hot water about twelve inches deep
the los angeles county coroner ruled it an accidental drowning with the effects of <unk> heart disease and cocaine use being contributing factors
brown is her only child
she encourages me and inspires me houston once said of her daughter
when i look at her eyes and i see myself i go okay
i can do this
i can do this
brown was born in one thousand nine hundred and ninety three during houston's marriage to randb singer bobby brown which ended in divorce in two thousand and seven
the daughter of music royalty became a public figure during the mid two thousand s reality show being bobby brown in which she frequently appeared alongside her parents and often had a front row seat to their marital fireworks
mother and daughter even performed together on national tv in two thousand and nine when the two sang my love is your love in central park on abc's good morning america
given the <unk> close relationship it's no surprise that houston's death was a major blow
days after her mother's body was found a grieving bobbi kristina then eighteen was taken to <unk> sinai medical center because she was overwhelmed family friend kim <unk> said
she loves hard <unk> said then of bobbi kristina
she's going to be ok and we're going to see to it
brown appeared on episodes of <unk> brief reality show the <unk>
on our own which followed life for the family after houston's death
one of that reality show's <unk> revolved around brown's relationship with nick gordon who lived with houston and her daughter from the age of twelve
months later brown reportedly got engaged to gordon
and in january two thousand and fourteen she tweeted out a picture of wedding rings presumably belonging to her and gordon along with the words <unk> <unk>
made me promise several times to look after <unk>
and mom i will never ever ever break that promise gordon told the entertainment show extra afterward saying houston just treated me like she gave birth to me
it was unclear whether gordon came home saturday morning to find his wife in the bathtub or had been in another part of the house overnight holland said
police have obtained a search warrant to look through the house but that's standard procedure she said
concern for brown surged again after news broke
music director michael <unk> sent along healing energy to the daughter of a late great friend
<unk> diane warren tweeted i hope bobbi kristina gets the help she needs
poor thing warren wrote
almost three <unk> to the day her mom passed and the same thing almost happened to her
the talks in belarus capital minsk ended with no signature on any proposals after a couple of hours discussions relating to the bitter conflict that has killed thousands of people in eastern ukraine the diplomat said on condition of anonymity
discussions were unlikely to resume on sunday according to the diplomat
differences were very wide and the atmosphere was described as not fruitful to agreement or cooperation the diplomat said
at the meeting were representatives of the ukrainian government russian government and the organization for security and co operation in europe as well as representatives of the self proclaimed donetsk people's republic and luhansk people's republic denis <unk> and <unk> <unk> according to ukraine's national news agency ukrinform
the talks which came on a week when fighting escalated in eastern ukraine had been expected to start friday but were delayed
in the past twenty four hours fifteen ukrainian soldiers were killed and thirty three were wounded ukraine's national defense and security council said in its daily update on the situation
the town of <unk> was the focus of the fiercest fighting on saturday the <unk> said adding that separatist forces are trying to seize it so they can attack the town of debaltseve afterward
debaltseve northeast of donetsk city has been the scene of fierce fighting in recent days as separatist forces seek to surround ukrainian troops
ukrainian authorities have evacuated three hundred and ten civilians from debaltseve the <unk> said
but the town's residents remain at risk
twelve civilians have died in debaltseve as the result of the militants shelling vyacheslav <unk> donetsk regional police chief reported on his official facebook page
he said he was in the town and that the shelling was continuing
the reports of civilian deaths in debaltseve come a day after shelling in donetsk city killed twelve people according to an official with the pro separatist city council
cnn could not confirm twelve deaths in donetsk but its team in the city saw seven bodies after a series of shell blasts near the center
it's not clear who is responsible for the shelling
in previous instances each side has blamed the other
the chief monitor for the osce mission in ukraine ambassador <unk> <unk> condemned the shelling of densely populated civilian areas in eastern ukraine
yet again innocent civilians have been impacted by the crisis and yet again we are seeing more bloodshed said <unk>
osce monitors were on the scene in donetsk city friday to examine what happened
it should be understood that the main outcome of such violence is a surge in human suffering
i urge all sides to exercise maximum restraint and fully assume their responsibility to prevent further displacement and suffering and to <unk> their efforts to reach a political settlement he said
the government in kiev and its western allies accuse russia of fueling the violence by sending troops and military equipment over the border into ukraine
moscow denies the allegation although it has said some russian soldiers are fighting as volunteers
from mid april to january twenty one the conflict killed at least five thousand and eighty six people and injured at least ten thousand nine hundred and forty eight others according to the united nations
on friday the two eagles balloon <unk> by american <unk> bradley and russian <unk> <unk> surpassed a gas balloon world record for duration <unk>
the record of one hundred and thirty seven hours five minutes fifty seconds was set by double eagle ii on a one thousand nine hundred and seventy eight <unk> flight
according to rules set by the federation <unk> <unk> the record must be surpassed by one percents in order to qualify as a new record
the two eagles reached that point friday at ten fifty one a.m
et
officially the record hasn't been broken
it may be weeks or months before the u.s. national <unk> association reviews and documents it
friday's duration achievement follows another milestone thursday when the <unk> surpassed a one thousand nine hundred and eighty one distance record for gas balloons set by double eagle v
under the same rule the <unk> had to best the one thousand nine hundred and eighty one record of five thousand two hundred and eight miles or eight thousand three hundred and eighty two point five four kilometers by one percents
with that distance margin safely surpassed the balloon is expected to land saturday on the <unk> peninsula in mexico completing its six thousand mile journey
the two eagles balloon launched from <unk> japan on january twenty four
the pilots and the support team on the ground have been tweeting about the journey
that's the way the joke would open pairing the most unlikely of <unk> partners the short legged long bodied <unk> with the larger stronger pit bull
but <unk> is proof that the match has happened
it is a true pit bull head on a <unk> body said dawn <unk> of the <unk> <unk> county humane society in south georgia
a man found the dog now named <unk> wandering in his backyard
he called the shelter and described him as a pit bull with short legs <unk> told cnn affiliate <unk>
hi
i'm <unk> and i'm looking for my forever home
i'm full of energy
i don't like walking on a <unk> reads a posting on the animal <unk> facebook page
i'm a <unk> pie and love to run
i don't listen very well so you'll need to take some time to train me
because i tend to be a bit hyper i might not be the best addition to a household with little kids
but i'm sure that all i need is a little <unk>
and with that posting and others <unk> has become a social media sensation
we posted a photo of him when he became available
and within a day it went to one million hits
and by that night it was up to two million
and now it is over two point four million hits <unk> said
humane society workers are taking their time to pick his new owner because they don't want him to become a freak show
it will be a pretty tough test for people that are wanting this dog
they're going to have to answer questions we're going to do follow up inspections on him said don flowers also of the humane society
the humane society is hoping <unk> newfound star status will bring attention to other animals on the county's facebook page there are dogs <unk> and <unk> as well as <unk> and <unk> the cats along with others
<unk> who is fully grown at twenty five pounds is <unk>
he is expected to be adopted by next week
man <unk> with stolen dog during search for new pet
on monday kurdish fighters declared that they had released the city on the border to turkey from isis grip after one hundred and twelve days of fighting
the efforts of the kurdish fighters known as the ypg or people's protection units on the ground were backed by an extensive campaign of airstrikes by the u.s. led international coalition against isis
and according to the interviews given to isis aligned <unk> news agency in syria it was those airstrikes that won the battle for kobani referred to by the fighters as ayn al islam
recently we have withdrawn from ayn al islam bit by bit because of the airstrikes and deaths of a number of our brothers said one of the two fighters his face covered apart from his eyes
he points to a scene of destruction behind him but <unk> that isis will persist and this is the message we send to obama
the second fighter interviewed by <unk> stood near a road sign reading ayn al islam
he said isis forces had raided three hundred and sixty villages around kobani from which the people ran away like rats
but the reason behind their withdrawal from the city he said is that we no longer had places to hold there
we were inside ayn al islam and we occupied more than seventy percents but the airstrikes did not leave any building standing they destroyed everything
his horror of the airstrikes was apparent
i swear by god their planes did not leave the air day and night
they did airstrikes all day and night
they targeted everything
they even attacked motorcycles
they have not left a building standing
but by god willing we will return and we will have our revenge <unk>
isis is on its heels after the loss of kobani and an offensive by kurdish peshmerga armed fighters who protect iraq's kurdish region around mosul iraq's second largest city and a focal point for all sides in the conflict
but on friday the sunni extremist group launched an assault on iraq's oil rich city of kirkuk in what may be an attempt to divert kurdish troops from mosul
a report by <unk> a private website dedicated to presenting news from a kurdish perspective said at least thirty isis fighters were killed in the assault and fifteen captured
casualties on the other side included brig
gen. <unk> <unk> the highest ranking operational commander of the peshmerga brigade located in kirkuk
isis captured fifteen employees working at the <unk> <unk> southwest of kirkuk after launching their assault in the area brig
gen. <unk> <unk> the head of <unk> suburbs and villages police told cnn on saturday
a joint operation is underway by his police officers peshmerga and kurdish security forces to free the hostages and take back control of the <unk> seized by isis militants on friday <unk> said
troops have already liberated al <unk> village also taken by isis on friday and located next to <unk> oil field he said
meanwhile gen. hussein mansour the head of peshmerga forces in <unk> in diyala province was killed in clashes with isis in southwestern kirkuk <unk> jabari a senior kurdish figure and local peshmerga leader told cnn on saturday
mansour brought his troops from <unk> about one hundred miles away to reinforce the peshmerga in kirkuk following the isis assault he said
u.s. and coalition aircraft carried out seventeen airstrikes in iraq on friday according to a u.s. central command statement ten of them near kirkuk and two near mosul
both the coalition and the peshmerga are trying to prevent isis from opening a new front in kirkuk which isis likely hoped would lessen the pressure on mosul
additionally by going on the offensive here isis appears to be offering some obvious targets for strikes
if isis can be driven back from positions in kirkuk it will have to try other tactical offensives to draw kurdish forces away from the outskirts of mosul
the kurds on their own admission have no intention of entering mosul but want to choke off isis supply lines into the city
another ten airstrikes were carried out friday against isis targets in syria eight of them near kobani
according to the syrian observatory for human rights a london based opposition group from october six to monday the fighting for kobani killed nine hundred and seventy nine isis combatants three hundred and twenty four ypg fighters and twelve rebels backing the ypg
thirty eight more isis militants died in attacks using booby trapped vehicles or bomb belts and the isis shelling of kobani killed twelve civilians sohr said
on the other hand hundreds of militants died during u.s. and arab allies airstrikes on the city and its countryside the group said
however the success of the coalition airstrikes in kobani will be hard to replicate elsewhere
there are almost no civilians left in the city of kobani and most residents left early on when the fighting started especially in the contested areas close to the front line
this meant airstrikes were fairly straightforward with the coalition able to target one side and avoid civilian casualties
the front line was well defined so it was clear where the isis and kurdish fighters were
a more challenging situation is when airstrikes seek to target isis inside populated areas like mosul in iraq raqqa in syria and other cities under isis control
here the effectiveness of airstrikes is limited because of the risk of casualties among civilians
when coalition airstrikes hit cities in aleppo in northern syria civilian deaths were reported last year

the world no
one beat second ranked maria sharapova six three seven six in the australian open final to move into sole possession of second place in grand slams won in the open era behind steffi <unk> twenty two
and on this form matching graf or surpassing the german shouldn't be <unk> even if williams turns thirty four in september
i would love to get to twenty two williams told reporters
but i have to get to twenty first and then i have to get to twenty one
there's so many wonderful young players coming up so it will be a very big task
the american defeated her russian rival for the sixteen th straight time although sharapova ensured it was a <unk> contest from start to finish
indeed the finale between two of the most recognizable athletes in the world produced some <unk> rallies which hasn't always been the case when they've played due to williams <unk>
it's frustrating to be the one going home with the small trophy sharapova told reporters
but i do love the battle
i love high quality tennis
i love being part of it
it's a lot better than watching it on tv
a <unk> sharapova saved match points in two different games with punishing <unk> both players took turns <unk> shouts of come on williams was <unk> in the second set for yelling out in celebration when a point wasn't over and despite not being fully fit williams covered the court with <unk>
a twelve minute rain delay in the first set during which williams <unk> off court forced organizers to close the roof on rod laver arena and with conditions subsequently perfect for serving it boosted williams already potent delivery
i also started serving better in the second set because i knew if i wasn't having my ground strokes where i wanted them to be i knew i could serve it out williams said
fifteen of her eighteen <unk> including one to wrap up the nearly two hour contest came in the second
when the games on her serve were thirty all forty thirty or fifteen thirty a few times she came up with really great serves sharapova said
there's a few just very limited amount of players that serve in that speed range as she does consistently
she finds the corners extremely well
williams who suffered from a fever and cough all this week set the tone by breaking in the first game
she took control of the first by winning six straight points following the rain delay to build a five two advantage
but sharapova one of the game's best competitors didn't melt in the second set
she matched and even surpassed williams from the baseline
sharapova saved one match point trailing five four and the other at four six in the tiebreak after saving two match points in the second round
another escape act wasn't on the cards however
with williams finally holding match point on her own serve she thought she hit an ace out wide
a let was called
no matter
she <unk> and hit an almost identical serve to see off sharapova
the pair haven't always gotten along <unk> current boyfriend men's pro <unk> dimitrov is believed to have formerly dated williams but a warm handshake ensued
williams maintained her record of never losing past the quarterfinals in melbourne improving to twelve zero
besides suffering another defeat to williams sharapova failed in her bid for a sixth major and first outside roland garros in seven years
i haven't beaten her in a really long time but i love every time i step on the court to play against her because she's been the best and as a tennis player you want to play against the best sharapova said
i was almost down and out in the second round and i feel like i gave myself a second life in this tournament and gave myself an opportunity
it wasn't quite enough today but i'm proud of my effort and couple of weeks here
like williams four time winner djokovic has never been beaten at melbourne park in a semifinal or final
it's been done
that's basically air force one in a nutshell
now the pentagon has announced the next generation of this world class icon will be a military version of the seven hundred and forty seven eight
for nearly thirty years the current jumbo jet air force one has been a customized version of the seven hundred and forty seven two hundred b
the newer seven hundred and forty seven eight is longer and more efficient than its older brother
why is a new one necessary
it is time to upgrade air force secretary deborah lee james said in a statement wednesday
the difference between the civilian version and what the president will fly on
the commander in chief gets a plane that's <unk> out with top of the line parts and backup systems
and a lot of technology that's well classified
related
what's new about the seven hundred and forty seven eight
let's remind ourselves why the world is so fascinated with this flying technological marvel
for more than half a century passengers aboard the u.s. presidential aircraft have been witness to american history
consider the fact that all these things happened on an air force one
president <unk> body was flown to washington for burial
lyndon johnson was sworn in as president
<unk> let a reporter interview him in the plane's <unk> while dressed only in a towel
the only woman ever to swear in a u.s. president did so aboard air force one
president richard nixon became the first american president to visit china where he historically opened the door to u.s. chinese relations
air force one served as president george w. bush's command center during the first hours following the nine eleven attacks
one of the main goals for the new plane the air force said will be <unk>
although the plane is designed to be more fuel efficient than its predecessor a new seven hundred and forty seven eight lists for around three hundred and sixty eight million dollar
add all the presidential bells and whistles and the <unk> price goes north rather quickly
the seven hundred and forty seven eight is made in the u.s. which the air forced hinted was a plus
the boeing seven hundred and forty seven eight is the only aircraft manufactured in the united states when fully <unk> meets the necessary capabilities wednesday's statement said
the four engine airbus a three hundred and eighty the world's largest airliner which is made in france was thought by some to be <unk> only competition for air force one
when will the president get a new jumbo jet
hard to say
if everything goes smoothly boeing likely will work with the air force on hammering out a timeframe and production schedule
in december boeing had thirty six <unk> orders for twenty four passenger versions and twelve freighter models
from humble beginnings as a small less than <unk> outfitted plane during the <unk> administration to its current jumbo jet status air force one has become a world class icon representing power and privilege
members of congress celebrities and advocates <unk> for seats on it to get rare access to the president arguably the most powerful person on the planet
the plane's well known blue and white color scheme was largely created by legendary industrial designer raymond <unk> and approved by jfk himself
officially the aircraft is only called air force one while a sitting president is aboard
the presidential fleet includes several aircraft other than the two seven hundred and forty seven s that from time to time carry the air force one call sign
the presidential helicopter is operated by the marine corps and is often seen ferrying the president to and from the south lawn of the white house
it's called marine one
on the rare occasion the president travels by army aircraft that is known as army one
by the same logic aircraft used to carry the vice president are given the call sign air force two
over the years the various air force ones have had their fair share of hollywood screen roles
for example the technological <unk> onboard the present seven hundred and forty seven s got wide play in the one thousand nine hundred and ninety seven <unk> ford action movie air force one in which the president's jet is hijacked by russian <unk>
however many of the more outlandish <unk> featured in the film owed more to shall we say artistic license than to airborne fact
the plane for example has no escape pod
nor is it equipped with parachutes the massive <unk> created by an aircraft the size of a seven hundred and forty seven means they can't be used
designed to operate as independently as possible from ground services the aircraft can fly halfway around the world without refueling
they carry their own automated baggage <unk> as well as built in front and <unk> stairs enabling them to operate self sufficiently at airports and <unk> around the world <unk> security risks
capable of in flight refueling from airborne <unk> manufacturers say the aircraft has virtually unlimited range its passengers sustained by <unk> capable of storing up to two thousand meals at a time
the entire aircraft is shielded against the effects of <unk> pulse a wave of energy generated by the detonation of a nuclear device that can disable unprotected electronics
it features private accommodation office space and a workout room for the president first lady and family
as well as accommodation and offices for support staff and security personnel
also on board is a <unk> and conference rooms that can should it ever be necessary be converted into a fully functional airborne medical center
remember the likeagirl video which became a sensation last summer
it's now been viewed online more than eighty million times worldwide according to the company behind it always a maker of <unk> pads
and it's about to reach even more viewers
the powerful video so clearly demonstrated how the phrase like a girl <unk> up negative and weak stereotypes
when adolescent girls older women and boys were asked to demonstrate how to run like a girl or fight like a girl their arms <unk> as they ran and awkwardly slapped instead of throwing powerful <unk>
contrast that with <unk> girls girls ten and younger who when asked to do the same thing ran as fast as they could and hit as hard as they could
they were girls on fire and to them running like a girl meant nothing more than running like themselves
well a sixty second version of this video is about to get its biggest audience by far when it is showcased during the super bowl on sunday
to give you a sense of the possible reach more than one hundred and ten million people around the world watched the game last year
<unk> francisco vice president of global always said the company has been thrilled with the response to the ad including over fifty four million online views alone for the english version but determined that the most watched television event of the year could take the message even further
we've only reached one half of our girls in the united states and
even fewer boys and men with the message so i think with such a powerful message like this and the fact that we know it's already making an impact and changing perceptions there's no better platform than the super bowl
francisco said the power of the ad is <unk>
it <unk> the real and serious issue of the drop in self confidence that girls go through at puberty and how attitudes can shift just by watching the video
she cited a study of one thousand eight hundred americans between the ages of sixteen to forty nine which was conducted by the group research now in december
among girls ages sixteen to twenty four seventy six percents no longer said they saw the phrase like a girl as an insult after watching the video she said
two out of three men who saw it said they would stop or think twice before using the phrase like a girl in a negative way
it's already making an impact and changing perceptions
there's no better platform than the super bowl to reach over one hundred million people to spread the message and <unk> the meaning of like a girl francisco added
this super bowl ad will leave you <unk>
no word on the cost of the sixty second spot but it is probably in the millions
cnn's brian <unk> reported that thirty second spots for sunday night's game on nbc cost four point five million dollar
lauren <unk> is a critically acclaimed director and photographer whose past works include the film thin about eating disorders the documentary the queen of <unk> about the economic collapse in two thousand and eight and the book girl culture on body image
she directed the like a girl video which involved interviews with more than one hundred people
the fact that like a girl is playing at the super bowl is so exciting and important because it puts the message broadly into the mainstream in front of men as well as women said <unk> who happens to also be a friend of my husband's and mine
as we gather to celebrate one of the most important days in sports like a girl reminds a giant audience that we need to empower our daughters sisters and mothers to be their best and that means playing ball and living life like a girl said <unk> who received a directors <unk> of america award nomination for the commercial
she says she's the first solo female director to get a nod in the commercial category
i am very proud that i also broke through a barrier by directing like a girl she added
after a year in which the nfl has faced questions about how it handles domestic violence against women and campus sexual assaults have garnered national headlines the likeagirl ad could have an impact beyond the phrase itself some women say
it is hugely significant that the likeagirl commercial is being shown during the super bowl
the ad turns a negative stereotype of girls on its head during one of the largest sporting events watched by men all over the country said jennifer <unk> newsom filmmaker and founder and chief executive officer of the nonprofit the representation project
the representation project is paying close attention to what ads are shown during the super bowl
it is collaborating with the three percents conference to host the second annual super bowl <unk> to monitor the portrayal of women in ads during the game
<unk> newsom said stereotypes don't just hurt women
they hurt boys girls and men too she said
especially after such a destructive year for the nfl i hope we get to a place where we are not relying on gender stereotypes to divide us and instead can work together for a healthier culture for all she added
her newest film the mask you live in about the impact our narrow definition of <unk> is having on boys men and society just <unk> at the <unk> film festival
in addition to unveiling a sixty second clip of the video during the super bowl always is sending <unk> <unk> a fifteen year old quarterback and the only girl on her football team in northern virginia to the super bowl as a likeagirl ambassador
the brand is encouraging people to share the video and what they proudly do likeagirl on social media during the game
we can change the meaning of words
that's what we are taking a stand on and our message which we hope will inspire girls women boys is that we can make the everyday like a girl to mean amazing things always francisco said
i think our girls deserve that

even suge is short for a family nickname that hardly seemed fitting for one of hip <unk> most feared <unk>
sugar bear
being known as big and <unk> is not how knight rose to fame
instead he is best known for helping promote west coast rap in a field that had long been dominated by east coast artists and <unk> an east coast west coast hip hop feud to a level that many still hold accountable for the deaths of two of the <unk> biggest stars
how the co founder of death row records who is being held in connection with one's man death in an alleged <unk> hit and run came to be considered such a tough guy is equal parts legend and rap sheet
born in compton california as the youngest of three children and the only son knight had sports ability and size earning a football scholarship to the university of nevada las vegas
his former coach told the las vegas sun in one thousand nine hundred and ninety six that knight was a good kid
he wasn't a problem guy at all said wayne <unk> who was school's head coach in one thousand nine hundred and eighty six when knight played there and who later went to work for the new orleans saints
you didn't really see that street <unk> about him
knight briefly played as a defensive <unk> for the los angeles <unk> before becoming a <unk> for singer bobby brown
that gig didn't last long but helped give him a larger glimpse into the music industry
being from compton knight had for years been friends with fellow native andre dr. dre young a member of the controversial rap group <unk>
its hard core songs include f <unk> police which helped form the basis for what became known as <unk> rap
the oft repeated tale is that to get young released from his contract with ruthless records owned by fellow <unk>
member eric <unk> e wright knight appeared at the <unk> offices with a group of men armed with pipes and baseball bats
i know you've heard all the stories knight told a new york times magazine writer in one thousand nine hundred and ninety six about the incident
but you have to realize one thing
results
young was eventually released from his contract and became knight's flagship artist when he co founded death row records in one thousand nine hundred and ninety one
another infamous story had knight <unk> rapper <unk> ice over a balcony to get the latter to share the profits from his hit song ice ice baby
the rapper whose legal name is robert van <unk> has since said the incident has been exaggerated
i went to my hotel room and suge was in there with several people van <unk> said during a one thousand nine hundred and ninety nine <unk> one behind the music episode about his career
he let me know he wanted to get some points off the record ice ice baby
suge took me out on the balcony started talking to me personally
he had me look over the edge showing me how high i was up there
i needed to wear a diaper that day
i was an investor in death row records with no return on my money
the rapper added he didn't hang me off from any balcony okay
the <unk> been kind of blown out of proportion and i want to clarify that suge and i have no bad feelings towards each other
knight's roster of artists included several who were no strangers to violence and run ins with the law including snoop <unk> dogg and tupac shakur
in one thousand nine hundred and ninety four shakur accused producer sean <unk> combs and rapper christopher <unk> <unk> wallace with being involved in an incident at a new york studio in one thousand nine hundred and ninety four in which shakur was shot
both combs and wallace denied the accusations
but the tensions intensified in one thousand nine hundred and ninety five after knight gave a speech at the source awards where he said any artist out there that want to be an artist and stay a star and don't have to worry about the executive producer trying to be all in the videos all on the record dancing
come to death row
many took the comments as a direct dig at combs who often appeared in his artists music videos
the following month jake <unk> a death row employee was killed during a late night party in atlanta in which both knight and combs were present with their <unk>
those from knight's camp blamed combs <unk> and the death brought public visibility to what was known as the east coast west coast rap war
knight was driving the car in which shakur was a passenger when the rapper was shot to death in las vegas in one thousand nine hundred and ninety six
the following year wallace was shot to death while riding in a <unk> in los angles that included his friend and mentor combs
there was speculation that both of the deaths were tied to the feud though the slayings remain <unk>
in one thousand nine hundred and ninety six knight was sent to prison for almost five years for <unk> a man in a las vegas hotel on the night shakur was killed
in two thousand and two he was jailed for violating his probation by <unk> with known gang members and again the following year for punching a parking attendant outside a hollywood nightclub
in two thousand and five knight was shot in the right leg at a party in miami held in honor of <unk> west's planned appearance before the mtv video music awards
history repeated itself in august two thousand and fourteen when knight was shot six times at another pre <unk> party this one hosted by singer chris brown
in october knight and comedian <unk> <unk> williams were arrested for allegedly stealing a photographer's camera
his legal issues and the departure of many of his top acts resulted in knight's label filing for bankruptcy in two thousand and six
in an interview with rolling stone in two thousand and thirteen to celebrate the twenty th anniversary of <unk> debut album <unk> knight portrayed his label as a <unk>
death row wasn't only a black owned record label death row was pretty much the only american owned record label he said
everything else was either sony or some other thing
it became the blueprint for any label that's out including the majors he said
i was the first person doing three hundred and sixty degree deals with all the artists
the majors would tell the artists it's the worst piece of s t deal in the world don't go for it
and now they're doing it
three weeks to the day since he informed a group of republican <unk> in new york that he was serious about a third presidential bid romney on friday finally pulled the plug on his long and sometimes agonizing political career telling supporters that he would not mount a third bid for the republican presidential nomination in two thousand and sixteen
mitt romney will not run in two thousand and sixteen
he decided he could be the nominee said tagg romney the oldest of romney's five sons
the fear was that in order to get there it was going to be so hard fought that he could not emerge from a position of strength
the family he explained all said we would support him although none of us was looking forward to the process
but no one said we won't go through this
romney's decision to forgo a run made over the weekend in consultation with his family came on the heels of what associates described as frank and clinical strategy session with his closest advisers in boston last friday at the offices of <unk> capital the financial firm run by tagg romney and spencer <unk> romney's top fundraiser
romney's announcement also came two days after david kochel one of romney's closest confidantes since his days as massachusetts governor announced that he would join the likely campaign of jeb bush romney's top rival for support in the republican establishment
at the boston meeting last week romney's brain trust gave him a clear eyed assessment of his chances in two thousand and sixteen with some aides <unk> in via conference call
it wasn't pandering and <unk> said one person on the call
it was here's the data
ever since romney trial ballooned his campaign at the office of republican <unk> woody johnson earlier this month his donor network had grown lukewarm to the idea his former staffers had started accepting offers with other potential candidates and the media consensus about romney three point zero had <unk> somewhere between skepticism and ridicule
some of his closest longtime associates including boston based advisers eric <unk> and peter flaherty were pushing him to run
his wife ann was also supportive sources told cnn though anxious about putting themselves through the grueling process of a national campaign once again
and one source close to the family says that a donor on his own did some in depth private polling and the results were shocking about how strong romney was running
others in his camp expressed <unk> of another campaign against a much stronger field than the cast of <unk> <unk> and polarizing conservatives that romney faced in two thousand and twelve
romney was told that while his old grassroots supporters and field organizers in early states like iowa and new hampshire maintained deep respect for him they were not <unk> about a third campaign
perhaps more frustrating for a businessman who <unk> himself on the formidable financial network he built in two thousand and twelve romney learned that bush who had jumped into the presidential fray quickly in early january was quickly <unk> away his support among top donors and was winning the early battle for gop establishment money
in almost every big donor state bush was securing commitments from <unk> who once <unk> up for romney
tagg romney
i'm both sad and relieved at dad's decision
still his team ever loyal to the man they <unk> called the <unk> were in agreement that they would make it work if he wanted to gas up the <unk> for one more ride
the takeaway was there is enough wood here to build a fire said another close romney adviser who joined the meeting
we thought it was was possible
but it would be hard
last time we had all the winds at our back and this would have been difficult but absolutely <unk>
look if people like rick santorum can get in then it's a no brainer that the governor could have done it and done it well
said the adviser
the polls had him up
that was residual name id
but he can't carry that for a year
it would have been a fight
at the friday meeting aides were given <unk> to start pulling together operational plans
advisers also concluded that it would be smart to launch some kind of political action committee to begin raising money and send a message to donors that his interest was more than just a <unk> act
people said we have to get ready to take the next step said one adviser
if he is not ready to run we need to announce a committee because we have to start raising money and sending a message to people
but when there was no follow up from romney this week people began to wonder if he might be pulling back
according to tagg romney his father came to the conclusion that he was unlikely to enter the race that weekend but wanted to sit on the decision for a few days
three clues from romney's day in mississippi that he wasn't going to run
many of romney's supporters say his decision to opt out by no means takes him out of the race entirely
longtime romney adviser ron kaufman said that romney believes the best role for him is to help <unk> the message and help the winner of the primary process deliver that message
i think he came to the conclusion that while yes he can win the primary yes he can raise the dough perhaps he can beat mrs. clinton there's an easier path to winning the presidency if mitt doesn't get involved but stays above it as the most popular republican in the country kaufman said
but jim merrill romney's top new hampshire strategist said the governor had arrived at the conclusion that it was time to step aside and let others take up the party mantle
i think having run before he understands how grueling it is
he knows it would be a challenging primary
knowing what we went through in two thousand and twelve i think he decided it was time for other voices to be heard
romney mentioned the need for other voices to be heard in the bowing out statement he read to supporters on a conference call friday
but <unk> in his words was a critique of bush not exactly the new face romney was describing as his preferred nominee
i believe that one of our next generation of republican leaders one who may not be as well known as i am today one who has not yet taken their message across the country one who is just getting started may well emerge as being better able to defeat the democrat nominee romney said
in fact i expect and hope that to be the case
romney and bush have a <unk> relationship but are not close
romney's advisers have said that the two thousand and twelve nominee is skeptical that the mild <unk> bush who last ran for political office almost a decade ago is ready for the <unk> of a modern campaign and the media scrutiny that comes with it
still it was bush who <unk> romney in the early stages of the so called invisible primary lining up donors and well regarded staff talent with <unk>
his hire of david kochel formerly romney's top strategist in iowa blindsided romney this week
bush's swift behind the scenes maneuvering which his advisers have described as a shock and awe strategy rattled romney once he caught wind of it in early january
the bush activity prompted romney to announce his interest in the race three weeks ago and freeze donors in place as he thought through the <unk> of another campaign
but it became clear that many of his former financial supporters and staffers were not only moving to bush but also other candidates vying for mainstream republican support including new jersey gov
chris christie florida sen. marco rubio and wisconsin gov
scott walker
romney's decision to pull back on a campaign gives renewed life to all of them said james <unk> a republican fundraiser
with romney out the field is back open and it <unk> other candidates who are trying to be the anti jeb he said
who is going to be the alternative to jeb bush and rand paul on the right
yes says diego neria <unk> a transgender man who says he had a private audience with the pope in late january reportedly a first for the pontiff
neria was born as a girl in spain and raised as a devout catholic
but after his sex change operation eight years ago many people <unk> him in church in his hometown of <unk> in western spain
neria recalls heated discussions with a parish priest and some others in town
afterward he started staying away from mass
i've never lost faith ever neria says
but the other thing is the rejection
he wrote to pope francis last year saying his local bishop helped get the letter noticed
next according to neria came two phone calls from francis
and then a <unk> audience on a saturday evening january twenty four at the papal residence <unk> santa <unk>
vatican <unk> and the local spanish <unk> office declined to comment on the meeting insisting the pope's private meetings are just that
neria a civil servant told cnn that he's not an activist for transgender people and doesn't expect changes overnight
this man loves the whole world neria says of pope francis
i think there's not in his head in his way of thinking discrimination against anyone
i'm speaking about him not the institution
catholic doctrine holds that sex change procedures do not change a person's gender in the eyes of the church
but if this pope has a long life which all of his followers hope neria says i think things will change
and he's already seen changes at home
the downside
neria says he's <unk> to the sudden media interest in him since the story broke in the local paper <unk> of <unk>
he says he's gotten queries from journalists as far afield as india and colombia
but he also sees a positive side
just the fact that you've met the holy father without knowing what was said neria says people now seem to look at you in a different way
at least one hundred and nineteen cases were confirmed by late last year including forty deaths the world health organization said in a statement
and the disease is taking an alarming turn
the outbreak that started last november has some disturbing dimensions the who said this week
the <unk> that transmit this ancient disease from rats to humans have developed resistance to the first line <unk>
it's especially spreading in densely populated slums in the capital of <unk>
cases were confirmed in at least twenty districts and the capital christophe <unk> of the <unk> <unk> de madagascar said late last year
<unk> is part of a team working with the who on the ground to combat the disease
the plague is caused by <unk> <unk> a bacteria found in <unk> and spread by <unk>
recent flooding in the nation has displaced tens of thousands of people and an untold numbers of rats leading to fears the disease could spread said margaret chan director general of the world health organization
once an infected <unk> bites human beings they can develop the <unk> plague which is marked by swollen <unk> <unk>
if the bacteria reaches the lungs one can develop <unk> plague
the <unk> type is rare but more dangerous than <unk> plague because it can be transmitted between humans through inhalation and coughing
if diagnosed early <unk> plague can be successfully treated with antibiotics the world health organization said
<unk> plague on the other hand is one of the most deadly infectious diseases
patients can die twenty four hours after infection
at least eight percents of cases advance to <unk> plague the who said
it's unclear what percentage of the current cases <unk> the more lethal plague
past plague epidemics have have occurred in europe the united states africa asia and south america
the plague was known as the black death in europe in the fourteen th century and led to the deaths of fifty million people the who said
the workers were repairing a building used for scenery when it collapsed thursday police spokesman chen chung <unk> said

<unk> new feature silence tells the story of two <unk> priests in seventeen th century japan and the <unk> of japanese christians at the time according to <unk>
the film is in pre production its <unk> <unk> <unk> said in a statement
the production was concerned that the existing structure on the <unk> back lot was unsafe and a third party contractor was working to reinforce it when it fell
everyone is in shock and sorrow and expresses their deepest concern and sympathy to the families of the individual who died and those who were injured <unk> said
police will investigate to determine whether any laws were broken
there have been no arrests or charges
it's only thirty seconds long
the visuals pan the inside of a family's house with a few pictures of kids on the walls
the dialogue is simple
a woman orders pizza from a nine hundred and eleven operator
after a moment of frustration the <unk> catches on that this woman is in trouble and pretending to order pizza from nine hundred and eleven is the only way she can call the police
this commercial created by the advocacy group no more is the only tv ad that has ever made me bury my head in my hands and <unk>
listening to the woman ask for help reminded me of the two policemen who came to my home twenty three years ago when my abusive husband choked me and beat me so severely i thought he would kill me
with the recent controversy over baltimore <unk> running back ray rice and san francisco's ray mcdonald alleged sexual assault of a woman the nfl badly needs some good pr when it comes to violence against women
the league has not historically taken abuse by players seriously
according to the usa today nfl arrest database there have been eighty nine family violence arrests of nfl players since january two thousand making domestic violence the worst crime category within the nfl
in the first few weeks of two thousand and fifteen one nfl player new orleans junior <unk> was arrested for alleged assault of a woman in his home
he denied the allegation
but the bigger problem isn't going away
the nfl's refusal to understand domestic violence and punish offenders obviously needs to change
although the league deserves polite applause for using the most watched sporting event of the year to raise awareness about domestic violence one powerful ad isn't going to solve the problem
the nfl seems committed to <unk> domestic violence perpetrators through its new personal conduct policy
it has hired domestic violence advocates such as cynthia hogan one of the original authors of the congress one thousand nine hundred and ninety three violence against women act
but there are easy things we can all do to end domestic violence
the first
learn how complex and cold blooded abuse is
intimate partner abuse has nothing to do with testosterone or playing or watching sports
it doesn't even necessarily have anything to do with being male
relationship abuse is a systematic pattern of psychological and or physical domination perpetrated by both men and women at alarming rates across all ethnicities income levels educational degrees religions and nationalities
relationship violence is one of our society's most common <unk> and <unk> felony crimes
here are a few misconceptions to explode on super bowl sunday
domestic violence occurs in all communities and all countries
without a doubt someone from your school your neighborhood your church or your workplace is currently being abused
the major risk factor
being young and female
women eighteen twenty four are three times as likely to be abuse victims and one in four women will be physically abused by an intimate partner at some point in her life regardless of her iq or <unk>
if you are being abused just leave
abusers often threaten to kill victims if they leave
statistics show that most domestic violence <unk> happen after the relationship has ended
victims often have children pets homes family members and jobs to protect
it takes an average of seven attempts often over the span of years to escape a domestic violence relationship
leaving is rarely easy
the abuse stops when you end the relationship
financial abuse stalking and battles over children are common post relationship abuse vehicles to manipulate and harm victims
many of the fifteen million children who witness family violence every year pay the abuse forward
boys who are exposed to violence in their homes are more likely to abuse their own partners and children later in life
how can this be true when millions of boys are victims of family abuse and over ninety six percents of convicted abuse perpetrators are male
actor and singer harry <unk> said it best
men who created violence against women are the ones who should end violence against women
it will never happen to me
that's what i thought growing up in washington dc in a nonviolent family of harvard graduates
i thought i couldn't possibly be stupid enough to let a man beat me until my husband also an ivy league graduate choked me five days before our wedding
during our marriage he held a gun to my head pushed me downstairs routinely called me <unk> and repeatedly threatened to kill our dog
abuse can happen to anyone
although the police had evidence my husband was not arrested or charged
at the time i had no idea that physical abuse was a crime and i would have protested that i was a strong smart woman in love with a troubled man but not a battered wife
there's nothing i can do to help
abuse thrives only in silence
simply by talking about the complex realities of intimate partner violence with your friends co workers and family you establish yourself as a sympathetic resource for victims in the future
and please take half a minute on superbowl sunday to watch this ad
if a man can dress up as a woman to entertain an audience then why can't a white person get on stage in <unk> the daughter of former vice president dick cheney wondered aloud thursday in a private facebook post obtained by cnn
why is it socially acceptable as a form of entertainment for men to put on dresses make up and high heels and act out every offensive stereotype of women but it is not socially acceptable as a form of entertainment for a white person to put on <unk> and act out offensive stereotypes of african americans
cheney wrote in a post on thursday her private facebook page
some of <unk> posts appear to only be visible to those who are in her facebook network
shouldn't both be ok or neither
cheney wondered
cheney who is openly gay and married emphasized that she was not drawing any comparisons between white people painting their faces black and transgender individuals only men who entertain in drag
cheney said the question was sparked after seeing an ad on tv for the upcoming season of <unk> <unk> drag race
asked via facebook message whether she'd like to clarify her comments cheney gave a brief response
seriously
it's not the first time cheney has taken her views to facebook
cheney took to facebook in nov. two thousand and thirteen after her sister liz who was campaigning for senate in the wyoming gop primary reaffirmed her opposition to same sex marriage
liz this isn't just an issue on which we disagree you're just wrong and on the wrong side of history cheney wrote then on facebook
after apartheid fell he was put on trial and sentenced in one thousand nine hundred and ninety six to two life sentences plus two hundred and twelve years in prison
but de kock showed <unk> meeting with victims families some of whom publicly <unk> him and helping the missing persons task force locate bodies a fact noted by south african justice and correctional services minister michael <unk>
in the interests of nation building and reconciliation <unk> said friday he was granting parole to de kock
de kock was a police officer who ran the c ten <unk> unit designed to battle the foes of apartheid including members of the african national congress
he operated from <unk> a farm outside <unk>
when apartheid fell and the <unk> gained control of the government de kock cooperated with the truth and reconciliation commission established in one thousand nine hundred and ninety four to achieve full disclosure of apartheid era <unk>
de kock was convicted of murders such as the deaths of five unarmed people in a van in one thousand nine hundred and ninety two and many other crimes
he was sentenced in one thousand nine hundred and ninety six after an eighteen month trial
south africa doesn't have the death penalty
in asking for a mitigated sentence de kock said the unit he commanded was established with the full knowledge and approval of senior government officials and police generals according to the <unk> <unk>
<unk> granted de <unk> request that the date and conditions of his parole not be made public
that means the state will not carry out any executions in two thousand and fifteen the agency said in a press release
ohio said in early january that it will add <unk> sodium a drug the state used for lethal injections from one thousand nine hundred and ninety nine two thousand and eleven the department said
<unk> sodium and <unk> will be the only drugs used
ohio decided to stop using the two drug regimen of midazolam and <unk>
that drug combination was last used in january two thousand and fourteen on convicted murderer dennis mcguire
witnesses said he <unk> and <unk> about ten minutes before he died
the mcguire execution was closely watched because midazolam a sedative and <unk> a painkiller had never been used in a u.s. execution
ohio like many states was forced to find new execution drugs after european based manufacturers banned u.s. prisons from using their drugs in executions among them danish based <unk> which manufactures <unk>

the california department of public health sent out the latest numbers friday of confirmed cases since december and while the total is still small the jump was a startling fifty four percents in just more than a week
most cases fifty eight are linked to an outbreak at disneyland in mid december
health officials said forty of the cases were employees or park patrons while eighteen of the cases were secondary infections
the new numbers include two cases in marin county near san francisco where one parent of a six year old has asked school officials to bar any children who have not been vaccinated for measles mumps and <unk>
father asks school district to ban children who haven't been immunized
fortunately there is no need to exclude any students from a marin county school at this time as there is no evidence for school based exposure the county public health office said in a statement
the two measles patients are siblings both of whom are unvaccinated
their cases are related to the outbreak at disneyland
cnn affiliate <unk> reported the children aren't going to school and aren't in the county
the health department said sixty three percents of the people with measles are more than twenty years old
measles is a highly communicable respiratory disease caused by a virus and spread through the air
measles starts with a fever runny nose cough red eyes and sore throat the centers for disease control and prevention says
opinion
why i won't let unvaccinated people around my kids
the disease outbreak became apparent when visitors reported coming down with measles after visiting the park from december fifteen to december twenty
at least five disney employees have been diagnosed with measles disney said
measles was declared eliminated in the united states in two thousand which means it is no longer native to the united states but continues to be brought in by international travelers
last year the united states had its most number of measles cases at six hundred and forty four since two thousand the cdc says on its website
in the first twenty eight days of january alone eighty four measles cases were reported in fourteen states including california according to the cdc
the larger california statistic that the state released friday encompasses december and january
new cases are being reported regularly as are public notices for those who might have <unk> with infected people
for example the new york state health department on friday announced a new measles case in <unk> college in <unk> on hudson which is one hundred miles north of new york city
the infected student rode amtrak train no
two hundred and eighty three from new york city's penn station a train that went to albany and eventually to niagara falls
the cdc recommends that children get two doses of the mmr vaccine beginning at twelve months with the second dose between the ages of four and six years old
infants six to eleven months old should get the vaccine before international travel
the information backed up a report by eric pelletier a national security reporter at the french magazine l'express who wrote that amedy coulibaly recorded seven minutes of the attack including the moments when he killed three people
citing a french source close to the investigation pelletier reported friday that coulibaly was able to use a computer at the market to email a copy of the attack video before he was killed by police
coulibaly was carrying the gopro camera on his torso during the january nine attack and subsequent standoff the source told l'express
french investigators have viewed the recording said pelletier who shared details of his reporting with cnn
but a second police source told l'express saturday that it could not yet be determined whether coulibaly had managed to email out the video
there is a strong probability that this video may have been transmitted to a recipient and not to a traditional media outlet an investigator told l'express
the investigator expressed his fear to see that video surface online one day
the source said french investigators have examined computers recovered from the grocery store and are looking into what accomplices coulibaly may have connected with around that time
several survivors said coulibaly tried to connect to the internet on his own computer but failed
he then went to a second computer in the store after forcing a hostage to help him
he inserted his memory card into the computer and appeared to be manipulating video or image files on the computer
coulibaly reportedly had proclaimed his allegiance to isis
he is believed to have killed a policewoman a day before the market attack
officials said they believe hayat boumeddiene coulibaly's widow may have played a role in the plans and has fled to syria
two days before coulibaly was killed brothers said and cherif kouachi attacked the offices of satirical magazine charlie hebdo killing twelve people and injuring eleven
they died the same day as coulibaly as police moved in to end a separate siege
obama will address attendees about the importance of religious freedom on feb. five at the annual national prayer breakfast
the dalai lama arguably the most visible symbol of <unk> struggle for independence has also been invited
the white house declined to say whether the two leaders will meet at the event though national security council spokeswoman bernadette meehan pointed out that the two leaders have met three times before most recently last february
the president is a strong supporter of the dalai <unk> teachings and preserving <unk> unique religious cultural and <unk> traditions meehan said
as he has done in the past the president will see many religious leaders at the event but we don't have any specific meeting with the dalai lama to announce
the dalai lama won the nobel peace prize in one thousand nine hundred and eighty nine for his advocacy for tibet in the country and around the world

early monday morning the drone's owner who asked not to be identified says his friend was operating the quadcopter inside his apartment which is located within ten blocks of the white house
the owner who says he was not at his friend's apartment at the time explains it was the unfortunate decision to fly the drone outside the apartment window that initially led to the embarrassing run in with the u.s. secret service
but a glitch with the <unk> controls known as a flyaway to drone operators is also to blame the owner added
moments after the drone was flying outside of the building it <unk> <unk> off in an <unk> direction toward the white house the owner said
the drone operator has not been identified by the secret service as no arrests were made after the incident
a secret service spokesman said the agency's initial investigation indicated the operator was using the drone for recreational purposes
the flyer an employee of the national geospatial intelligence agency self reported his involvement to authorities hours after the crash the secret service spokesman said
initially contacted by cnn on wednesday the drone operator declined to comment
but his friend the drone owner pointed to numerous on line accounts of other flyaway <unk> involving operators of dji phantom quadcopters
as reported in the new york times there is a facebook page devoted to dji phantom users who have experienced similar mishaps
a dji spokesman sharply rejected the owner's story in an interview with cnn
for anyone to even consider operating a personal uav in this area is almost unfathomable and displays a remarkable lack of awareness dji spokesman michael perry said
we think a rogue fly away scenario highly unlikely given the reported circumstances perry added pointing to reports the drone operator in the white house incident had been drinking
still perry indicated dji has encountered technical issues with its quadcopters
we watch for and actively address any real anomalies in our systems perry said
however a separate company spokesman suggested such instances are rare
no this is not a common <unk>
most of the instances we've seen of this kind have been a result of pilot error said jon <unk> dji's policy and marketing representative
still <unk> are an increasing concern in the nascent consumer drone industry particularly due to the surge in interest among amateur users who can afford to spend five hundred dollar for the thrill of flying a device that is decidedly more advanced than a toy helicopter
in an interview with the wall street journal last december the chief executive of dji's chinese parent company said his staff is actively working to make its <unk> less prone to mishaps
we have to make something that can not go wrong in any scenario <unk> dji technology co chief executive frank wang told the journal
the journal article notes dji's <unk> are commonly featured in flyaway videos online
in an interview with cnn wednesday dji said it was requiring customers to download a <unk> update that would prevent the quadcopters from flying in the nation's capital
it is a violation to fly drones in washington d.c. punishable up to a year in jail and a fine

<unk> <unk> of <unk> health and nutrition placed a call to a woman in lebanon oregon but instead of a hello she heard what sounded like a violent struggle on the other end of the line
<unk> alerted her supervisor tina garcia
then her boss mario gonzalez ceo of <unk> stepped in
gonzalez says he was walking around the sales floor when one of his managers asked him to listen to a call and what he heard was very traumatic
call center workers say they heard a woman screaming for her life and yelling please don't kill me according to a press release from the <unk> county sheriff's office
it just got progressively worse gonzalez told cnn affiliate <unk> in las vegas
we were not going to hang up this phone on the young lady said garcia
as far as i was concerned the people in that room we were the only lifeline
gonzalez was about to call las vegas police but decided to look up local oregon officials
he alerted the <unk> county sheriff's office which dispatched personnel to check out the home
when deputies arrived on scene a female was heard calling for help while a male voice could be heard saying quiet according to the press release
deputies reported seeing thirty three year old walter warren john <unk> holding a woman from behind when they entered the home
<unk> let go of the woman who was crying and <unk> for air according to officers
officials are not releasing the name of the victim
after an investigation deputies learned the woman claimed she was physically assaulted and <unk> with blankets and pillows during the alleged attack
the victim told officials <unk> threatened her with a rifle <unk> the stock of the gun into her chest according to the press release
she said she feared for her life and was convinced <unk> wanted to kill her and himself
the woman's cell phone was in her back pocket during the attack and she wasn't aware that someone called the police
gonzalez said the arresting officer called him back to thank him
deputies credited <unk> for intervening and possibly saving the woman's life

cnn reached out to <unk> attorney mark <unk> for comment but has not heard back
we've all done a lot of soul searching starting with yours truly goodell said
and we have taken action
the commissioner made these remarks during his state of the league given each season on the eve of the super bowl
this sunday's matchup is between the new england patriots and seattle seahawks
the nfl is the most popular professional sport in the united states which makes the spotlight on it that much brighter
on friday goodell touched on a number of subjects from instant replay to extra points to a possible franchise in los angeles
but he couldn't get away from issues that have dogged his office chief among them how the nfl handles allegations of domestic violence by players
goodell said the nfl wasn't where it needed to be in august when then baltimore <unk> running back ray rice became the center of controversy after video surfaced showing him hitting his then fiance
this case came on top of several others from child abuse accusations against minnesota <unk> running back adrian peterson to an assault case against carolina <unk> defensive star greg hardy that had some demanding that the commissioner resign
he gave no indication friday he would do any such thing even after what he called a year of
humility and learning
we obviously as an organization have gone through adversity but more importantly it's been adversity for me goodell said
and that is something where we take that seriously
it's an opportunity for us to get better
it's an opportunity for us for our organization to get better
for the first time the commissioner also addressed what's been dubbed deflategate which relates to the use of underinflated footballs in the first half of the new england patriots afc championship win over the indianapolis colts
as information leaked out about the situation some suggested strict punishments for new england from large fines to <unk> to kicking the team out of the super bowl
but the patriots have fired back with coach bill belichick denying wrongdoing and suggesting science could explain the air pressure issue and owner bob kraft suggesting the nfl may owe belichick and patriots quarterback tom brady an apology if its investigation finds no wrongdoing
what the heck is deflategate anyway
the commissioner made no apologies friday for the league's handling of the case saying this is my responsibility to protect the integrity of the game
he's tapped ted wells to lead an external investigation into the issue
i represent thirty two teams he added
and if we have any information where the potential is that those rules were violated i have to pursue that and i have to pursue that aggressively
that investigation is focusing on two main questions according to goodell
why were some footballs used in the game that were not in compliance with the rules and was this result of deliberate action
he added i want to emphasize we have made no judgments on these points
and we will not compromise the investigation by engaging in speculation

he returned to iran in two thousand and twelve to help build a state run secular orphanage
it was during this visit that he was abruptly pulled from a bus and imprisoned
over the last two and a half years abedini has endured beatings and torture at the hands of his <unk> and fellow inmates according to his family
at one point reports circulated regarding death threats targeting abedini from isis prisoners held at the same iranian facility
president obama you have my prayers from inside of these walls abedini wrote
i pray for god's guidance wisdom and blessing for you as you lead this great nation
<unk> letter to obama was posted online by the american center for law and justice an organization founded by television <unk> pat robertson that has worked to <unk> <unk> situation
in the letter abedini thanked obama for meeting with his wife naghmeh abedini and their children in <unk> idaho on january twenty two
they have had a heavy burden to carry in my absence and your presence helped to relieve some of that burden abedini wrote
with this meeting i feel more hopeful now
it's becoming a higher priority said naghmeh abedini
the ten minute face to face meeting with the president was an answer to my prayers she added
the meeting took place in a <unk> and intimate setting
the kids were there and i saw a lot of compassion and care as we talked naghmeh abedini said
the <unk> have two children <unk> and jacob both under the age of eight
jacob asked obama if he would be able to bring his father home in time for an upcoming birthday according to the abedini family
sharing some words of comfort the president responded that he would try
i could see that he cared as a father said naghmeh abedini
during their meeting the president reassured naghmeh abedini that her husband's case was a high priority
he told her that he and secretary of state john kerry meet regularly regarding the issue and kerry continues to bring up abedini and to push for his release in ongoing meetings with the iranians
naghmeh abedini said obama promised her the united states will keep at it until saeed is released
the abedini family has been fighting for his release for the last three years
earlier this month the obama administration called for <unk> immediate release along with other americans held in iran including washington post tehran bureau chief jason <unk>
in a subsequent briefing white house press secretary josh earnest emphasized that the issue of american citizens imprisoned in iran is of great concern for the administration
the fact that kerry raised the issue in his diplomatic exchanges with the iranians is an indication of how seriously the united states takes this case said earnest
abedini continues to be denied adequate medical attention for injuries said <unk> <unk> international legal director for the <unk>
it's not that they haven't given him any treatment
it's that they continue to give him medications that have not helped and doctors medical tests have concluded surgery is necessary <unk> said
despite their grueling emotional journey abedini family members say they continue to hold on to hope as they make headway in bringing increased attention to saeed <unk> story both in the united states and internationally
since meeting the president naghmeh abedini said she has received follow up calls from the white house and is set to meet with u.s
ambassador at large for international religious freedom david <unk> <unk> at the end of february
princess elena of <unk> who will debut next year on disney <unk> sofia the first according to the company appears to represent a commitment to diversity which also happens to be a smart business strategy in a country with a burgeoning latino population
but most importantly elena a princess meant to reflect diverse latin cultures and <unk> says disney will offer young latina girls an opportunity to see themselves in the media that they consume
just like other american girls
and they will see a lot of her
elena will have her own animated series later in two thousand and sixteen and will be voiced by the dominican born actress <unk> <unk> according to a disney press release
in other words
move over cinderella there is a new <unk> in town
from sleeping beauty to snow white the disney princesses are a staple of pop culture fantasy <unk> iconic to generations of young girls
disney has introduced with great fanfare <unk> diverse princesses before
the asian princess a native american princess a middle eastern princess and an african american princess
and they are no longer primarily known for their ethnicity
they are simply seen as disney princesses
the same will likely be true of elena
what's crucial is that all young disney fans can feel included visible and relevant through a multicultural lineup of <unk>
by seeing themselves throughout our culture the next generation of <unk> will feel more fully part of american society
besides it couldn't hurt for young <unk> have a positive role model even if she is a fictional character
a two thousand and twelve study by the national hispanic media coalition found that tv shows and films often contributed to the public's negative perception of latinos
in fact the coalition found that the top three ways that non latinos viewed latinos in the media were as criminals <unk> and <unk>
elena also reflects an important recognition by disney of the power of the latino consumer market
last year the nielsen company estimated that u.s. hispanics have a spending power of one dollar <unk> trillion and companies like ford <unk> and <unk> <unk> have all targeted hispanic customers
disney already markets a line of <unk> dresses so elena could be seen as a logical extension of their brand
it can not be lost on disney that its rival <unk> has enjoyed phenomenal tv and <unk> success with their latina character <unk> the explorer
sure some critics have expressed reservations about elena noting that she is not getting her own movie like the other princesses and that she is on disney junior channel not the more popular disney channel
and disney generated controversy when it debuted sofia the first in two thousand and thirteen
sofia was initially reported to be the first latina princess and then the company walked back on comments by a producer and declared that sofia was not latina after all
but i think disney should be applauded for trying again
the enormous reach of the company will ensure that millions of viewers are exposed to an <unk> latina character
consider <unk> series will be rolled out in twenty five languages on disney junior channels in one hundred and fifty four countries around the world
that's a lot of <unk>
it is welcome news that disney is finally introducing a princess that looks like thousands of little hispanic girls
here's hoping that someday elena will be seen not just as a latina princess but as a character as american as <unk> mouse

i am still a little bit in shock
it was a nightmare she said describing how hospital workers tried to rescue babies from a nursery as flames engulfed the building
a nurse and two babies were killed by the blast mexico city health secretary <unk> <unk> told cnn affiliate <unk>
at least seventy three people were injured he said including about twenty newborns
outside the hospital frantic family members searched for word of loved ones they feared were inside
searching continued thursday evening at the site though officials said it appeared everyone had been accounted for
jose eduardo was relieved to learn his wife and son who was born wednesday had survived the blast
he heard about the explosion on the news from his home where he'd gone to rest after the baby was born
he rushed to the hospital to be by his wife's side
she told me that it started to smell like gas and the ceiling started to fall on everyone he told cnnmexico
she covered up the baby and ran
his wife was barefoot when she escaped he said

we heard something and it smelled so much like gas really a lot
and then two minutes three seconds later we saw an explosion that made everything fly in the air witness teresa <unk> told cnnmexico
it threw me to the ground
virginia gonzalez who lives near the hospital said her <unk> was covered with broken glass from blown out windows

lugo the nurse who was inside the hospital during the explosion told cnnmexico she is suffering from first degree burns but feels lucky to be alive
i feel grateful to have another chance to keep living she said to keep working as a nurse
first calls came into firefighters reporting a gas leak at the hospital a facility on the southwest outskirts of mexico city that is part of the government health system
hospital workers had already started <unk> the building when the explosion happened minutes later mexico city mayor miguel angel mancera told reporters
one of the city's publicly accessible <unk> captured the blast showing a plume of smoke rising from the direction of the hospital
a truck was supplying gas to the hospital when apparently a hose burst and the resulting leak caused an explosion mancera said
the gas in question is known as liquefied petroleum gas a mix that could be mostly propane or mostly butane
these propane butane mixes are commonly used in mexico for heating cooking and other fuel applications
gas express <unk> the company that owned the truck has operated in mexico city since two thousand and seven and has a contract to supply gas to hospitals run by the mexico city government the mayor said
the hospital is seventy percents collapsed mancera said although some walls and steel columns are still standing
but in the isolated town of sandino cuba's first catholic church since the one thousand nine hundred and fifty nine revolution took power is set to be built
there is money to start there is the construction material to start there are the <unk> to start so everything is ready said bishop jorge <unk> <unk> <unk> who oversees the diocese where the new church will be built
the sandino church has been fifty six years in the making ever since fidel castro took power and cuba became an officially atheist state
religious people fell under suspicion by the new revolutionary government but none more so than those who belonged to the catholic church which was seen as being overly sympathetic to the batista regime that castro had driven from power
in the first years of the revolution thousands of catholic priests were jailed or forced into exile and church property including the <unk> school that castro attended was seized by the cuban government
only with the visit in one thousand nine hundred and ninety eight of pope john paul ii to the island did relations between the cuban government and catholic church begin to thaw
christmas again became a national holiday and cubans faced less official discrimination for practicing their faiths
in december cuban president raul castro thanked pope francis for his role in the secret talks that led to a prisoner swap between cuba and the united states and the start of negotiations to restore full diplomatic relations
in two thousand and fifteen church officials said requests to build new churches that had long been <unk> in red tape began to receive government approval
while church officials said several new catholic houses of worship are in the works the first will be built in sandino a remote town at the end of a <unk> <unk> road in cuba's <unk> province
the rev
<unk> castro drives that road to sandino once a week to <unk> mass in a converted garage in the back of a house the church <unk>
he has lost count of the miles he has put on his green russian <unk> as part of his ministry to towns throughout the province
when the new catholic church is built the first in <unk> history castro said he would move to <unk> there full time
i hope the church doesn't stay within the four walls he said that it will go farther than that
that with the building of the new church there will be more people of faith castro said
the cuban catholic church desperately needs more followers in cuba where in recent years the <unk> religion <unk> that mixes african religions with catholicism has exploded in popularity
the church in sandino will take about two years to build and when completed will hold two hundred people castro said
most of the fifty thousand dollar collected so far for the new church comes from fund <unk> held by the st. lawrence catholic church in tampa florida
much of <unk> history and culture comes from cuba said the rev
tom morgan st. <unk> <unk>
it's absolutely fantastic they are building a new church and i hope to be able to visit one day
morgan said he was optimistic that recent changes in u.s treasury department regulations would make it possible for his church to send supplies and building materials to cuba to help with the construction of the new church
as she makes her way down a path to attend mass in <unk> castro's converted garage <unk> martinez said she has waited more than five decades for a church to be built in sandino
martinez said she her husband and two children were those relocated to the town during early one thousand nine hundred and sixty s when a <unk> fidel castro was still battling what he called <unk> <unk> against his revolution waging guerrilla warfare in the countryside
while there is no official tally hundreds perhaps thousands of people suspected of plotting against the revolution were shipped to sandino to live in a form of internal exile
it was a process to make a community for political prisoners martinez said
they took our farm away and brought us here
a lifelong catholic martinez said one of the most devastating things about being forced to move five hundred miles away from her home to a town she had never heard of was that there was no church
having a church is very important she said
many of the people here were brought up catholic and need a church
we were <unk> and prayed when we went to bed and woke up just like our parents and grandparents taught us
but kerry was slapped with a fifty dollar fine this week when he didn't clear a sidewalk on the side of his home in boston where a blizzard <unk> more than two feet of snow earlier this week
kerry was abroad with president barack obama in saudi arabia on tuesday when the snowstorm hit new england
kerry was hit with the fine after a <unk> submitted a picture of the snow filled sidewalk on the city of boston's online citizens connect portal on wednesday
the snow removal company tasked with clearing the sidewalk alongside kerry's home initially cleared the front of kerry's home but <unk> yellow caution tape set up on the side of kerry's home as police tape and steered clear kerry's spokesman glen johnson said
the tape had been put up to warn <unk> of falling snow and ice overhead johnson said
the last of the snow around kerry's boston home was cleared late thursday morning
the snow has all been <unk> now the secretary will gladly pay the ticket and let's hope this is the last blizzard of the year johnson said
for an aviation enthusiast like leighton it was nothing short of thrilling
after years of anticipation leighton a real estate investor finally snagged a seat on a rare one thousand nine hundred and eighty s soviet built <unk> il sixty two airliner
patriotic military music filled the cabin
flight attendants handed out communist propaganda magazines
as leighton put it that two thousand and twelve flight on air <unk> airlines from beijing to pyongyang was an experience beyond belief
that's high praise
leighton may rank among the most accomplished <unk> in the world
he said he's flown on at least fifty kinds of aircraft and racked up an estimated two million air miles
the il sixty two by western standards was quite old but it was actually one of the newer planes i flew on while i was there leighton said
only a handful still fly in commercial service worldwide he said
its interior <unk> might have been inspired by a waiting room inside a one thousand nine hundred and seventy s soviet doctor's office leighton joked
<unk>
<unk> and blue
walls
a kind of <unk> <unk>
odd yes
but also spectacular and well kept
the twenty eight year old canadian native who lives in <unk> washington has rain man like <unk> skills which he'll show you if you prompt him
when i get on a plane i can not only tell you where it was manufactured i can also tell you when it was produced leighton said
his expertise has earned him appearances as an aviation analyst on canada's <unk> the bbc and the fox news channel
leighton also shares his <unk> adventures as a correspondent for <unk> dot com
how to travel to north korea
a police state that's largely cut off from the world may run its national airline a bit
differently from the west
crew members appeared to be thoroughly inspected before they get on the plane leighton said
neither a hair nor a button out of place
leighton was surprised when the flight attendants began speaking to him in english
you got the feeling that in north korean society aviation ranks among the most prestigious career paths he said
it allows them the extremely rare experience to explore their own country and to experience a bit of the world outside their borders
after <unk> down the beijing runway the powerful il sixty two rocketed into the sky like a fighter jet leighton said
when it leveled off it was time for meal service north korean style
at other times during <unk> north korean tour in flight meals may have been served with a side of paranoia
he and other passengers said they saw metallic <unk> a couple hundred feet above or below their plane
they suspected these <unk> were reflections from unseen military aircraft <unk> them nearby
you can't really be too scared leighton said
but you realize that if the pilot ever went crazy enough to make a run for the south with you on board the aircraft wouldn't be airborne for very long
that's only mildly <unk>
fear is relative he reminds himself
i mean remember you're on a thirty year old russian aircraft in north korea leighton joked
you kind of get <unk> fatigue after a certain point
opinions about air <unk> have been mixed
a two thousand and fourteen review by uk based <unk> gave it only one star out of five for poor service
but flying enthusiast sam chui who said he's traveled on air <unk> a dozen times <unk>
they provide decent service chui said
they're just using some different equipment which as a flight enthusiast you totally enjoy
just like its airplanes north korea's airline roots are planted in soviet russia
in one thousand nine hundred and fifty authorities formed an airline called <unk> which linked pyongyang and moscow according to flight global
in one thousand nine hundred and fifty five north korea's national carrier <unk> formed according to air <unk> website
the government <unk> it air <unk> in one thousand nine hundred and ninety two
efforts to modernize air <unk> fleet have been <unk> by longstanding international economic sanctions against north korea
among jet setting <unk> chui <unk> as the arch duke of aviation photography leighton said
chui said he has flown one hundred and eleven types of aircraft and logged more than two point four million miles
he fell in love with aviation while growing up in hong kong watching spectacular <unk> and landings at the now defunct airport known as kai <unk>
years later chui had turned into a full <unk> <unk> flying on the world's <unk> aircraft and scoring seats on new types of planes
this hobby is expensive
to pay the bills chui thirty four works as a financial markets investor from his home base in the united arab emirates
he figures the money he's spent over the years would have bought him a couple more houses
one of the last flights of the supersonic concorde
first test flight of the world's biggest airliner the airbus a three hundred and eighty
inaugural flight of the sleek new airbus a three hundred and fifty
bragging rights create a healthy element of friendly rivalry among his fellow <unk> chui admits
but aviation is big enough for everyone to enjoy
enthusiasts gather at conventions like a seattle area event co sponsored by <unk> dot com called <unk> which has quickly gained popularity since it launched in two thousand and nine
a self described super bowl for enthusiasts is airliners international hosted this june in atlanta
these are the places where <unk> will be writing their bucket lists of planes they most want to fly on
for leighton there seems to be no shortage of determination
his holy grail is a four <unk> russian bomber nicknamed the bear many of which are still in service at russian and indian military bases
there has to be some sort of <unk> legal way to get on one leighton said
so i'm gon na keep working at it
despite its relatively small size and population ghana boasts today one of africa's fastest growing economies driven mainly by its substantial natural riches and strong agricultural production
previously known as the gold coast ghana gained its independence from great britain in one thousand nine hundred and fifty seven becoming the first sub saharan nation to break the chains of <unk>
since then it has <unk> stormy periods of army rule and political uncertainty to emerge in recent decades as a vibrant democracy that has enjoyed several peaceful <unk> of power
over the last six years ghana's economy has grown each year by an average of six percents hitting a record breaking fifteen percents in two thousand and eleven
growth declined in the following years but in two thousand and fifteen economists expect the country to post strong growth of around eight percents
unsurprisingly the west african country has traditionally relied heavily on exporting precious metals and minerals including aluminum <unk> and of course gold ghana is the continent's biggest gold producer following south africa
another economic driver and big source of income is oil
since he the discovery of the jubilee field off the coast of ghana in two thousand and seven there have been twenty three new oil and gas finds
in two thousand and twelve oil earned the country three billion dollar while reserves are estimated at around two billion <unk>
besides oil and gold agriculture is a major pillar of ghana's economy
the sector makes up around twenty percents of the country's gdp but more importantly provides employment for more than sixty percents of its total workforce
at the heart of this is cocoa
ghana is the world's second largest producer following the ivory coast with the commodity being the country's third export product below oil and gold
yet lately the ghanaian government has stepped up its efforts to <unk> the economy pushing for more vegetable production to help boost growth
last year the country exported more than forty two thousand tonnes of vegetables up nearly four times compared to two thousand and nine
currently the vegetable industry pumps almost three million dollar into the country annually but with continued investment in local farms and crops that figure is expected to jump to more than twenty five million dollar each year

state attorney phil archer whose jurisdiction includes <unk> and <unk> counties announced friday that his office won't file charges against zimmerman who first came to the world's attention for his arrest and eventual acquittal in the two thousand and twelve shooting death of african american teenager trayvon martin
friday's announcement relates to the thirty one year old's arrest in lake mary florida on january nine
while it clear that the officers had probable cause to arrest mr. zimmerman which was <unk> by the circuit court judge at initial appearances the subsequent <unk> by the victim of her initial statement along with new documents provided by the victim and her attorney <unk> my office from proceeding further archer said
zimmerman attorney don west had told reporters that his client was accused of throwing a wine bottle at a girlfriend
police learned about it days later after coming in contact with the victim at a traffic stop lake mary police spokeswoman <unk> <unk> said
the woman has since denied that zimmerman threw a bottle or that she ever feared him according to a statement friday from lake mary police
she also made it clear that she did not want to proceed with the case said police noting that lake mary police chief steve <unk> <unk> with <unk> decision
a lack of eyewitnesses or other <unk> evidence to dispute her version of the incident also contributed to the decision
this is the latest instance since july two thousand and thirteen when a jury found him not guilty of murder in martin's death that zimmerman has had a run in with the law only to have authorities decide not to push for a trial
about two weeks after the verdict he was pulled over for speeding in northern texas
much bigger troubles came in november two thousand and thirteen when zimmerman was taken into custody at his then girlfriend's <unk> florida home after the two allegedly had a heated fight
he was arrested then on aggravated assault and misdemeanor counts of domestic violence battery and criminal <unk> accusations posting nine thousand dollar bail days later
but after the girlfriend asked that the issue be dropped archer announced that prosecutors would not press charges
<unk> has said the woman in the more recent instance is not the same as in two thousand and thirteen
also in september two thousand and fourteen lake mary police said that a man claimed zimmerman threatened him during a road rage incident saying i will
kill you and do you know who i am
he was not arrested and has not been charged
talking about the aggravated assault cases west said earlier this month of his client
it's clear he hasn't been very lucky with the ladies the last few months
the lawyer also said then that zimmerman doesn't have a full time job <unk> that he's had his struggles since the martin case which made him into a national lightning rod when it came to the merits of stand your ground laws and matters of race
it's been a devastating experience that he's had that he's working through the lawyer said
i'm concerned obviously
the embassy said two u.s. citizens were fired on near the palace in <unk> saudi arabia
one was wounded
there has been no fatality a statement from the embassy reads
no names were immediately released and information about what led to the shooting and the <unk> identity wasn't available
security forces are investigating and the embassy is seeking further information about the incident the statement reads
rather than getting behind the wheel however this robotic valet physically lifts your three tons of road machinery and slots it into pre designated robot parking <unk>
nicknamed ray by its creators the automated <unk> truck is the brainchild of germany's <unk> transport
aimed at business travelers in a hurry the automated parking system can be controlled and booked via an app
all travelers have to do is drop the car off in a designated area go to a nearby touch screen to confirm the car is empty and ray does the rest
ray uses sensors to measure and photograph the car it then gently lifts it and takes it to one of two hundred and forty nine parking spots reserved for the robot <unk>
the company claims that its space saving system which uses lasers and sensors to measure not just the height and width of the cars but accessories such as wing mirrors and <unk> can park sixty percents more cars than a human driver
the system is also connected to the airport's flight data system
ray will retrieve the car based on flight <unk>
the app also lets car owners communicate with ray if there are any flight delays
the airport charges twenty nine a day or four an hour for the service which the airport's management said was likely to appeal to time strapped <unk>
our product is especially appealing to business travelers who arrive at the airport shortly before the flight seek efficient parking and return within a few days thomas <unk> the airport's managing director said in a statement
a new tie up with <unk> announced this month aims to increase the efficiency of ray by getting the car and the parking robot to communicate with each other
our jointly developed technology exchanges data automatically between ray and <unk> cars via bluetooth and thus facilitates the parking progress said rupert kock the managing director at <unk> transport systems
but ray is not the only robot valet on the block
a new jersey startup called <unk> also aims to take parking to the next level by using an automated parking system that can park hundreds of cars without human intervention
<unk> them like the squares in a giant <unk> cube in <unk> that need no light and little ventilation the company says the system not only saves on energy but can fit more cars into a smaller space freeing up valuable land for other real estate
according to <unk> ceo mark patterson the advantage of his system is that it is designed with multiple entry <unk> multiple robots and multiple lifts so there is no single point of failure
if any one thing goes down we can still operate the system he told cnn
drivers put their car into a parking bay that places the car on a large steel tray
robotic wheeled platforms slide under the vehicle and then transport it to the <unk> following buried wires in the floor of the <unk>
patterson says its increased <unk> means the <unk> can be filled and <unk> more quickly than conventional <unk>
our system is installed in a garage with level concrete floors so there's total fire separation between floors like in a conventional garage most legacy systems are steel rack structures with no separation between floors he said
developers like it because you can park one hundred percents more cars in the same space and that's a big value proposition
the other advantage is that the <unk> is a sterile environment that has no need for human intervention
the cars are not running in these <unk> so there's a big savings on air handling equipment patterson said
you need seven or eight air changes an hour with traditional <unk> versus just one or two with this system
similarly there's also no need to illuminate the building to the sort of levels that would deter <unk> or other attackers that <unk> in the gloom of multi story <unk>
robots don't care if it's dark patterson said
would you let a robot swim in your bloodstream
digital nose on a chip can sniff out cancer
cnn could not confirm twelve deaths but its team in donetsk saw seven bodies after a series of shell blasts near the center of the city
five bodies concealed under sheets could be seen at a spot by the hotel europe where a local billionaire has organized food aid <unk> by his staff
one man had died at the wheel of his car
a shell apparently hit near where dozens of people were waiting in line for much needed supplies
elsewhere two more bodies could be seen where a <unk> bus was hit
until now the fighting has largely been concentrated on the outskirts of the city near the airport
but friday the blasts moved significantly closer to the city center where there are no obvious military targets
it's not clear who is responsible for the shelling
in previous instances each side has blamed the other
what is clear is the mounting civilian death toll with the ordinary residents of donetsk being caught up in the fighting
last saturday at least thirty civilians were killed in shelling in the southeastern city of mariupol while eight people died when a transit stop in donetsk was <unk> two days earlier
there has been fierce fighting around the town of debaltseve northeast of donetsk where separatist forces have almost surrounded ukrainian troops
u.s. state department spokeswoman jen psaki condemned the fighting there in remarks thursday and pointed the finger firmly at the pro russian rebels for any casualties
over the past week the separatists have fired countless rockets at the city killing and wounding scores of innocent people and prompting the ukrainian government and local ngos to organize a <unk> evacuation she said
there can also be no mistake about russia's role in the escalation of violence which is causing suffering and death among those russia has claimed it wants to protect
the government in kiev and its western allies accuse russia of fueling the violence by sending troops and military equipment over the border into ukraine
moscow denies the allegation although it has said some russian soldiers are fighting in ukraine as volunteers
presenting his annual report friday at nato headquarters in brussels belgium secretary general jens stoltenberg said two thousand and fourteen had been a black year for european security
russia is following a disturbing pattern he said using military force to <unk> crimea destabilize eastern ukraine and intimidate its neighbors in disregard of international law
on thursday the european union foreign affairs council announced it was extending the financial sanctions imposed against russian and ukrainian separatist interests until september in response to the mounting violence
it will also decide whether to add more names to the list of those sanctioned when it meets february nine
eu foreign policy chief <unk> <unk> said she was pleased the european union was maintaining a united front on the issue
we hope this can help put pressure in particular on russia to take positive steps and prevent negative steps to you've seen in recent days she said
in a statement the council strongly condemned the indiscriminate shelling of the residential areas especially in mariupol and the recent escalation of fighting in the donetsk and luhansk regions of ukraine
it said it was shocked by the high number of casualties adding
it notes evidence of continued and growing support given to the separatists by russia which underlines russia's responsibility
there are now nine hundred thousand internally displaced people and six hundred thousand refugees as a result of the conflict the council said
the eu has already given ninety five million euros for humanitarian assistance it said
russia's foreign ministry said friday that it was disappointed by the <unk> decision on sanctions and accused it of bias in favor of kiev saying it was hostage to an aggressive minority that is opposed to russia
it's time for the european union to realize the <unk> of the sanctions standoff that only hurts people and our economies the ministry said in a statement
ukrainian president petro poroshenko announced monday that kiev would ask the <unk> tribunal to investigate alleged crimes against humanity in the conflict in eastern ukraine
the conflict broke out last spring after russia annexed ukraine's southeastern crimea region and as pro russia separatists claimed control of the luhansk and donetsk regions
a ceasefire agreed to in minsk belarus in september crumbled long ago
new talks were supposed to be taking place in minsk aimed at finding a political solution to the crisis but there are conflicting reports as to whether they had been delayed
the new talks were unlikely to happen because representatives for ukraine's government had not arrived friday even though rebel representatives were there said <unk> <unk> the self declared defense minister for the rebel group donetsk people's republic
from mid april to january twenty one the conflict killed at least five thousand and eighty six people and injured at least ten thousand nine hundred and forty eight others according to the united nations
terry carter fifty five wasn't a product of the thug life but he did found and own the defunct heavyweight records said friend <unk> carraway thirty eight
carter mentored young men to a better life carraway said
his death will bring a lot of people together you know from all different walks of life <unk> <unk> ex gang members current gang members whatever people on the streets foster kids whatever the case may be carraway said
it's a sad day for them he added
carter was also a friend and acquaintance of knight through their work in making rap records said carraway who was a writer for heavyweight records during its business run between one thousand nine hundred and ninety seven and two thousand
they became friends through mutual friends and they hit it off and they were cool carraway said
from my understanding they had no issues whatsoever
they were friends
they respected each other
to my knowledge there was no <unk> ever whatsoever between him and suge knight carraway said
knight is being held in <unk> of two million dollar bond in the death of carter pending a court appearance which isn't expected until at least monday according to jane <unk> a spokeswoman for the los angeles county district attorney's office
knight arrested for murder in connection to fatal traffic incident in compton the los angeles county sheriff tweeted
police in los angeles say a man matching knight's description drove over carter and another man with his red pickup truck in compton a city adjacent to south los angeles that's renowned in rap music
the pickup truck driver ran over the two men again as he sped away from the scene
the condition of the second man <unk> sloan fifty one wasn't disclosed by police
so far people we talked to said it looked like it was an intentional act
so we're handling it as a homicide los angeles police lt. john <unk> said
the hit and run stemmed from an argument knight allegedly had on the set of the <unk>
biopic straight outta compton and then spilled over to the parking lot of <unk> burgers
the film is about how the group <unk> emerges from the streets of compton california in the mid one thousand nine hundred and eighty s and <unk> pop culture with their music and tales about life in the hood according to <unk>

he was just a father figure basically to me and an array of others who were inner city youth troubled youth gang members ex gang members that type of thing carraway said
he was a person that reached out to a lot of people to help then get on their feet helped them put food on their tables helped them become entrepreneurs
he gave a lot of direction to a lot of us who didn't have fathers growing up and things of that nature carraway said
he taught us positive stuff
more recently carraway saw carter at carter's <unk> birthday party on december twenty carraway said

knight forty nine turned himself in to los angeles sheriff's department investigators early friday
cnn affiliate kcal tv and the los angeles times quoted knight's attorney james blatt as saying knight feared for his life and was trying to flee when the incident happened
we feel strongly mr. knight did not do anything wrong in this matter
he was attacked by a number of individuals that has already been corroborated by certain witnesses
he left the scene because he was in fear for his safety and life he said
in a conversation with cnn before the arrest blatt declined to confirm to cnn whether knight was driving
police say knight allegedly tracked the two men to the lot
a red pickup truck is involved in this and those people were also at the other altercation so yes it all suggests that he was the person driving that truck <unk> said
it looks like he drove backward and struck the victims
and then went forward and struck them again as he left <unk> said
officers later found knight's ford <unk> abandoned in <unk>
early friday knight accompanied by his lawyer turned himself in at the west hollywood sheriff's station where homicide detectives were interviewing him
knight founded the wildly successful death row records in one thousand nine hundred and ninety one signing artists such as snoop <unk> dogg and tupac shakur
but then his fortunes began to <unk> with a series of run ins with the law
knight was driving the car in which shakur was a passenger when the rapper was shot to death in las vegas in one thousand nine hundred and ninety six
shortly afterward knight spent several years in prison for violating parole on assault and weapons convictions
that prison time along with <unk> death <unk> between knight and a number of rappers and <unk> by dr. dre snoop and others contributed to the <unk> bankruptcy in two thousand and six
in august knight and two other people were wounded in a <unk> while they were inside a celebrity filled sunset strip party hosted by singer chris brown on the eve of the mtv video music awards
in october he was busted along with comedian <unk> <unk> williams for allegedly stealing a photographer's camera

the reason why raif badawi received another reprieve friday wasn't immediately available but previous <unk> were made because doctors determined he was too badly injured in his first beating january nine to withstand more according to amnesty international and his wife
the case of badawi who was sentenced last year to ten years in prison and one thousand lashes after a jeddah court convicted him of insulting islam has garnered international headlines and global outrage
badawi started a blog called free saudi liberals in two thousand and eight to encourage discussion about islam particularly the intrusion of the nation's religious police in saudis personal lives
he was officially charged with adopting liberal thought founding a liberal website and insulting islam and was convicted of the latter
badawi received his first fifty lashes on january nine and was taken back to prison
he wasn't flogged as scheduled in subsequent weeks including this friday his sister <unk> badawi said
said boumedouha deputy director of amnesty international's middle east and north africa program said last week that saudi authorities should publicly announce an end to his flogging and release him immediately and unconditionally rather than assess his fitness to be flogged week by week
raif badawi is still at risk
there is no way of knowing whether the saudi arabian authorities will disregard the medical advice and allow the flogging to go ahead boumedouha said last week

back then he was the game's <unk> <unk> inferior players out of the way in an all out assault to overhaul jack nicklaus tally of eighteen majors and cement his title as the best of all time
tiger woods design was supposed to form another <unk> of his burgeoning legacy
a series of lasting monuments to <unk> his immense standing within golf
except the best laid plans of men often go awry
woods hasn't won a major since the scandal that engulfed his private life in two thousand and eight and only now nearly a decade on from the inception of his design arm is one of his plots open for business
with the verdict still out on whether he can <unk> that magical form and fatherhood having altered his outlook on life the concept of legacy is very much back on the agenda
my goal is to design a limited number of distinct and memorable golf courses woods told cnn in an exclusive interview
i hope that one day the courses i design will become a lasting contribution to the game that has given me so much
architects forever talk about moving earth when it comes to course layout and the sands have undoubtedly shifted under woods feet
after locking down fourteen majors in a nine year spell the former world no
one has just five top ten finishes in them across the last five injury hit seasons
the benefits of those spells in rehab has been more time to dedicate to design <unk> in woods first opening at <unk> san lucas in mexico just before christmas
and though there might have been an eight year wait for his first completed course which has been well received the second should be along within eight months
it will represent an important landmark too his first opening in the united states at bluejack national in houston
the fact that woods design operation is finally laying down roots across the americas has taken on an extra significance with his kids now of an age when they can start to play alongside their all star dad
he's obviously won a whole bunch of tournaments and major championships and they remain very important to him says michael abbott partner of beacon land development the company that's building bluejack <unk> course and a friend of woods for over twenty years
but to be able to take his kids charlie and sam to a golf course he's done is also very important to him
abbott agrees that a large slice of tiger woods design is about legacy
i think so
i think he's very proud and he wants to share that with not only those close to him but also everybody else
to say this is what i've learned and this is my creativity and now i'm putting it on the ground for you to see
perhaps unsurprisingly the junior woods are showing early signs of promise much to the delight of their proud father
i saw as much of his son <unk> swing as i did of his over the time we spent together abbott explained
he'd say come look at this this is the way i want to swing right here
tiger talks about the old days when he and his father used to go and play the short course in california and how the short course at bluejack reminds him of that the ability for young girls and boys to come out and play and challenge themselves but also have pure fun
he also built junior <unk> into the course at bluejack that tells you everything
woods who began his two thousand and fifteen season in phoenix on thursday is still active in his pursuit of nicklaus bumper haul of major titles
but he won't be trying to match the prolific nature of the golden bear when it comes to rolling courses off the production line at an exponential rate
the majority of nicklaus <unk> three hundred and eighty properties are in the u.s. while others are dotted around the globe in far <unk> places such as china russia nicaragua japan costa <unk> and new zealand
woods dedication to <unk> the heights he reached in the early part of the decade prevent him from taking on too much but even after he <unk> he insists he'll only pick projects that mean something to him
golf course design has always been something that i have been interested in woods who attempted his first design for a magazine competition aged nine explained
it wasn't until my ten th year on tour after having success on different types of courses all over the world that i had the knowledge and experience to start tiger woods design
i see it continuing to be very selective looking for only the best sites and partners to work with even after my golf career slows down
that the fruits of woods design labor are only starting to emerge has much to do with the financial downturn of two thousand and eight
several projects have been on the table for some time
the cliffs in north carolina and <unk> <unk> in mexico are yet to yield a completion date
a much <unk> project in dubai was <unk> in two thousand and eleven due to funding problems though woods recently announced he was teaming up with donald trump for another go at building in the <unk>
and while he has been enlisted to build another course at <unk> san lucas one industry expert thinks woods needs to go further if his design arm is to enhance his standing in the game
i can't see <unk> design business affecting his legacy unless he gets a project that really moves the dial adam lawrence editor of golf course architecture magazine told cnn
either a site where he and his team can build something that is universally viewed as one of the best courses in the world which <unk> they have the ability to do so something that hasn't be proven yet or <unk> they do something that has a real impact on <unk> development
with the best will in the world you don't change golf by building extremely expensive resort courses in <unk> an ultra high end residential project in houston or a monster expensive course to be run by donald trump in dubai
lawrence also believes woods might also benefit not just himself but also the game of golf itself by looking at designing a course in the <unk> countries
i would like to see tiger take on a low budget project in an emerging market he added
a tiger branded course in india or brazil but a proper public access cheap golf course and not a fancy housing development could really impact on how golf grows in that market
those projects in developing nations may well come down the line but listening to woods it is clear he believes bluejack national could enter the pantheon of great u.s. courses when it opens for business
bluejack national has one of the best natural settings for golf i have seen he said
with its changes in <unk> the beautiful <unk> and <unk> bluejack national is reminiscent of the <unk> of georgia and the <unk>
the opportunity is here to create a golf course unlike any other in the houston area and our goal is for it to be among the best in the nation
due for completion in october woods has been making regular visits to the site near the small town of montgomery in texas
abbott says he has been struck by woods willingness to take other opinions on board and how in tune he is with those players at the other end of the skill spectrum to himself
bluejack national is spectacular and i think it's incredibly special that this is his first course in the united states abbott said
when i first talked to tiger he mentioned the <unk>
this one cut of turf how you create great <unk> and how all levels of players can find some success
when tiger woods goes in he goes all the way
he doesn't do anything half way he's an all in guy and that's reflected in his work ethic on and off the course
this is important to him he feels like he's designing golf courses that will be meaningful because it will encourage people to play the game
at bluejack he's taken it to an even further level where he's designed this playground section a nine hole short course that is spectacular
he's also designed four little <unk> that help if you only had an hour or two to play
not only is he tackling golf course design from the angle of making it playable he's also tackling it from people's time commitments to be able to play whether it is someone who wants a couple hours on the course a corporate person entertaining a guest or a father and daughter
he's taken time investment and really put it into his design so you ask is the guy in tune
when a designer thinks that way i think he's in tune
still any <unk> golfer standing on the first <unk> of a woods designed course could be forgiven for <unk> with a mixture of fear and <unk>
woods litany of career titles have been secured on a collection of the world's most <unk> courses giving him ample ammunition when it came to <unk> out his own ideas
but his emphasis on <unk> essentially says to the amateur i've got your back
i have played enough pro ams over the years to know not every golfer is a scratch <unk> woods said
designing golf courses that players of all skill levels find enjoyable is very important to me
the biggest compliment that a designer can receive is if a golfer can't wait to play his golf course again
abbott is happy to talk legacy but he's also keen to stress that woods still has plenty left in his playing locker
having watched him take on a collection of journalists during the opening of el <unk> abbott says woods swing has its speed and power back
i'm absolutely backing tiger to bag some more majors he said <unk>
it's exciting to see him play this way
he's determined
the appetite is still there it's like he's never eaten before
what are your thoughts on romney's announcement
sound off on cnn ireport
romney acknowledged during the call that he may not have been the strongest contender for the gop in a general election and said that was the primary motivation behind his decision
former romney co chair not happy with two thousand and sixteen interest
i feel that it is critical that america elect a conservative leader to become our next president
you know that i have wanted to be that president
but i do not want to make it more difficult for someone else to emerge who may have a better chance of becoming that president he said
the two thousand and twelve gop nominee said on the call that he'll do whatever i can to help elect that person and attempted to tamp down any further speculation over whether he'll change his mind
that seems unlikely he said
accordingly i'm not organizing a pac or taking donations
i'm not hiring a campaign team
romney said that while he's convinced that we could win the nomination
it would have been a difficult test and a hard fight
our finance calls made it clear that we would have enough funding to be more than competitive
with few exceptions our field political leadership is ready and enthusiastic about a new race
and the reaction of republican voters across the country was both surprising and heartening he said noting early primary polling that's had him leading the potential gop primary field
but since his surprise announcement to donors earlier this month that he was interested in making another bid romney has had a rocky start
wall street wasn't ready for another mitt romney campaign
he's faced deep skepticism from some quarters within the party including some of his major donors and former campaign aides
many expressed concerns that romney wasn't the best option to take on expected democratic nominee hillary clinton whom the gop plans to portray as old news and out of touch both <unk> that could dog the former massachusetts governor if he runs again as well
and the decision this week of a top romney operative in iowa to sign up with bush's campaign was the latest in a series of defections raising doubts on romney's chances going forward
but romney's decision not to run doesn't remove him from the two thousand and sixteen calculus
rather it sets him up as a certain <unk> in the wide open gop primary as he still holds sway over many major donors and has deep respect within the party
and it <unk> former florida gov
jeb bush's position as the preferred candidate of the establishment in the gop primary improving his chances in the overall fight
a wide array of conservative contenders are expected to jump in the race and will jockey for position
romney's exit leaves just bush and new jersey gov
chris christie as the clear establishment contenders
bush used his social media accounts friday to praise romney's decision
though i'm sure today's decision was not easy i know that mitt romney will never stop advocating for renewing america's promise through upward mobility encouraging free enterprise and strengthening our national defense bush posted on his facebook wall friday after the announcement came
mitt is a patriot and i join many in hoping his days of serving our nation and our party are not over
it was december fifteen th one thousand nine hundred and fifty seven when she went into labor at a hospital in dublin ireland
as she floated in and out of consciousness she remembers being taken into a room with a single bed
i was pulled to the bottom of the bed
my legs were strapped into <unk>
i was nine months pregnant flat on my back she says
i was helpless and i did not know what was going to happen
then i got a local anesthetic and the torture began
as a room full of medical students and doctors looked on mccann says she could feel the pressure of a <unk> cutting into her
from then on it was just agony literally agony she recalls
i got a <unk> down my left side and i could not move at all to get myself any relief
mccann struggling against the <unk> pain couldn't see what the surgeon was doing to her
she assumed he was performing a caesarian section but he wasn't
he was <unk> into her pelvis to make way for her baby
mccann now eighty eight was undergoing a symphysiotomy a procedure seldom used by other industrialized nations by the mid twenty th century as caesarian sections became safer
symphysiotomy is a surgical procedure whereby the <unk> <unk> the joint that holds the pelvis together is cut in order to <unk> the birth canal during labor
roughly one thousand five hundred women in ireland were subjected to symphysiotomy between the one thousand nine hundred and forty s and one thousand nine hundred and eighty four according to the government
the procedure can cause chronic pain and <unk> of the bladder which can lead to incontinence according to irish <unk> jessica <unk>
in cases where the <unk> <unk> is completely severed patients may get earlier onset arthritis and joint degeneration <unk> says
the mechanics of your whole lower half of your body are changed because of that joint
mccann says she never <unk> to the procedure which she says has left a permanent gap in her pelvis
the operation amounts to torture according to survivors who have demanded an official apology from the irish government and an independent inquiry
above all women want the truth about these operations
they have been denied the truth for forty fifty sixty years says marie o'connor the chairwoman of survivors of symphysiotomy
a brief filed by the survivors group to the u.n. human rights committee recounted some of the mothers horrifying experiences under the knife
i just remember being brought into a theatre and the place was packed with people
i wasn't told what was happening
i was screaming and being restrained recalled <unk> a <unk> patient and <unk> member who recalled the birth of her third child in one thousand nine hundred and fifty nine at the same hospital where rita mccann had given birth two years before
i couldn't see much except for them sawing
it was excruciating pain she said
i was just twenty seven and i was butchered
<unk> another <unk> member says she was just seventeen when doctors performed a <unk> on her during the birth of her first child in one thousand nine hundred and seventy two
i was screaming
it's not working the anesthetic i said i can feel everything
i seen him go and take out a proper <unk> like a wood saw
a half circle with a straight blade and a handle she said
the blood shot up to the ceiling up onto his glasses all over the nurses
then he goes to the table and gets something like a <unk> iron and puts it on me and stopped the bleeding
they told me to push her out
she must have been out before they burnt me
he put the two bones together there was a burning pain i knew i was going to die
campaigners have accused the doctors who worked primarily in catholic hospitals of putting their religious beliefs before the well being of patients
the surgery was an abuse of power a pre <unk> surgical strike against the practice of birth control by obstetricians who <unk> <unk> section on account of its association with what archbishop of dublin charles mcquaid termed the crime of birth prevention o'connor wrote in two thousand and twelve
mcquaid was archbishop of dublin until one thousand nine hundred and seventy two and died the next year
cnn reached out to ireland's department of health for comment and was referred to the government commissioned inquiry from two thousand and thirteen
that report acknowledged the influence of religion on obstetricians in a catholic country where birth control was illegal from one thousand nine hundred and thirty five to one thousand nine hundred and eighty
it notes that alexander spain and arthur barry the doctors who championed the procedures at <unk> national maternity hospital in the one thousand nine hundred and forty s and fifty s were devout catholics serving a predominantly catholic patient population and they made no secret of their willing <unk> to religious <unk> in the treatment of patients
but the report also acknowledged the legal limits on medical practitioners at the time
whatever their personal <unk> or beliefs doctors <unk> in ireland were confined by key legislative limits in relation to family planning and advice the report noted
the u.n. human rights committee last summer asked ireland to conduct a prompt independent and thorough inquiry into <unk>
in july as a result of the government commissioned inquiry ireland launched an ex <unk> scheme one that allowed for payment without admission of liability to compensate victims with payments ranging from fifty thousand to one hundred and fifty thousand euros depending on the severity of the case
but marie o'connor says the government's offer doesn't do nearly enough for women who were physically and emotionally crippled by the procedures at state hospitals for decades
that is a sum of money that anybody would get here if they broke a leg at work she says
it seems to us that what the state is trying to do is buy off survivors at the lowest possible cost she says
the payment scheme is an ex <unk> scheme which does not meet international human rights standards because it is based on no admission of wrongdoing
she says some women are pursuing legal action
rita mccann one of the roughly three hundred victims who is still alive is not among those looking to the courts
and although she didn't find out about what had happened to her for decades she says she has felt the effects of her symphysiotomy since the day it happened
when mccann left the hospital she says she could barely walk for the first six months and she had to move back home to <unk> in north ireland so her parents could help raise the baby
to walk or to lift the baby my back would just go into a <unk> and my legs wouldn't work she says
basically you were crawling around holding on
and that lasted for a long long time
as bad as the pain was mccann claims that she wasn't told about the procedure and says that secrecy hurt even worse
he was obviously sawing me in half she says
why they couldn't come and tell me
it left me feeling guilt and it left me wondering on what effect it would have on my baby later in life
it was having a very bad effect on me so it was bound to have some effect on the baby
it never dawned on me that there was an alternative she says
but i think i would have taken the caesarian
before mccann lost consciousness on that terrifying night at the hospital more than fifty seven years ago she recalled the surgeon telling a student when she has a fine baby boy or girl in the morning she will forget all about it
but she says she can't erase the devastating impact of her symphysiotomy
it has been a lifetime she says
it's been a life sentence
the flight attendant who served the offending macadamia nuts testified that she and the chief flight attendant <unk> before heather cho the former vice president at korean air and the daughter of the airline's chairman in apology
the former executive also shoved her threw a tablet to her chest and called her a <unk> term for female dog after becoming angry over the service kim do <unk> the flight attendant testified in court friday

prosecutors say that the incident dubbed nut rage extends beyond cho's behavior but also to an attempt to systematically cover up what happened on the flight
kim testified that korean air told her to lie about what happened to investigators and not to talk about the violence
the december five flight bound for south korea had to return to the gate to remove the senior <unk> from the flight
although her former role put her in charge of in flight service cho was a passenger and was not flying in an official capacity
cho was served with an arrest warrant last month in korea in a case that has outraged the nation over growing resentment of the power held by its large family owned corporations known as <unk>
cho yang ho her father and korean air chairman apologized to the flight attendants and the public for the incident

the two combined to <unk> another great spectacle at the australian open and this time it was world no
one djokovic who <unk> the defending champion to book his spot in the final
last year wawrinka had downed djokovic nine seven in the fifth set when the pair met in the quarterfinals in melbourne en route to breaking the stranglehold of tennis big four but the serb <unk> friday seven six three six six four four six six zero in a match that had more plot twists than a low budget horror movie
when djokovic <unk> the hard fought affair it was the fourth straight time the pair went to five sets at a grand slam he joined roger federer and stefan <unk> as the only men in the open era to make five finals in melbourne
djokovic improved to nine zero in semifinals and finals at the australian open and that includes three wins over his opponent in the final andy murray
on thursday murray won an ill tempered clash against tomas berdych that landed the <unk> fiancee in hot water
<unk> streak appeared to be in jeopardy as the fifth set began however
with the serb <unk> wawrinka erred on break point in the first game when he sent a routine backhand long
djokovic took advantage of a deflated wawrinka to break in the next game and didn't look back
while the duo combined to make one hundred and eighteen unforced errors to go along with only sixty nine winners there was drama <unk> and still some brilliant shot making
wawrinka needed eye drops to <unk> an issue in the first set and djokovic had to be told by the chair umpire that he won the third set such was his level of concentration
djokovic blew a break lead in the fourth and wawrinka hit one of the shots of the tournament a backhand drop volley to save a break point later in the fourth
on other occasions he drew <unk> from the crowd by crushing his flat one handed backhand
whereas djokovic looked solid on his serve in his previous five matches wawrinka broke him five times
but the swiss not only lost his first tiebreak of the tournament having previously gone five zero he <unk> and was <unk> seven one
it was very emotional very tense as it always is against a top player in the semifinals of a grand slam djokovic told reporters
of course judging by the last two matches we played here
we could expect something like that a five <unk>
so the battle was great
it was no different this year from the previous two years in terms of you know fighting from both sides
the only difference was that the fifth set went completely my way
but again it was a tight first opening game of the fifth set where he had some break point opportunities missed an easy ball
despite the <unk> <unk> nature of the semifinal djokovic claimed he was content with his form ahead of the final against murray his longtime friend and tennis rival
i think i have much more positive things to reflect on in my game and then all the matches that i played so far in the tournament than the negative djokovic said
i'm in the finals
at the end of the day that's why i'm here you know to try to get far in the tournament
getting to the finals in any way possible is a great achievement
i'm going to try to use that for build up of the confidence for finals
his record against murray in australia he defeated the sixth seed in the two thousand and eleven and two thousand and thirteen finals works in <unk> favor
but then in both of murray's grand slam successes he beat djokovic in the final
he's been playing some great tennis these couple weeks said djokovic
from my side it's going to be necessary to perform at my best and play the best match of the tournament if i want to win
obviously it's finals
there's no clear favorite
but as you mentioned the record i have in finals against him here in australia we played couple times can serve maybe as a slight mental edge
but not much
i don't think he's going to feel that on the court
i'm sure he's going to be very motivated to win his first title here
i'm going to of course give my best that that doesn't happen
cause for concern for serena
like djokovic serena williams has never <unk> defeat at the australian open once she's progressed past the quarterfinals
the world no
one holds a sixteen two record against her foe in saturday's women's final maria sharapova
but the eighteen time grand slam winner cut short a first practice session friday because she was unwell
she went on to practice later
i had a false start williams said in a statement
i wasn't feeling really well
i've been sick with a cold all week and i got better then i got worse this morning
i just had to go back relax and take a nap <unk> my body
i rescheduled practice for this afternoon
it went well
i felt better
if the second ranked sharapova snaps her fifteen match losing streak against williams she would claim a first major outside roland garros in seven years
at least forty eight people were killed and dozens others injured friday in what authorities said was a bombing at a shiite muslim mosque in southern pakistan according to a local hospital
the attack took place just before friday prayers started in the city of <unk> in <unk> province said <unk> <unk> the city's information minister
fifty people were injured said to <unk> ali <unk> superintendent of the civil hospital in <unk>
the militant group <unk> claimed responsibility for the attack the group's spokesman ahmad <unk> said in a statement
pakistan is a majority sunni muslim country
shiites make up about ten percents to fifteen percents of the country's population according to the cia world <unk>
prime minister muhammad nawaz sharif strongly condemned the killings and vowed to fight terrorism
three of the prisoners isis apparently wants back are women a failed suicide bomber an alleged bomb maker and a woman tied to the head of isis
the fourth is a child
many countries have a strategy of not negotiating with terrorists
but this new approach by isis is putting governments to the test
in its most recent demand isis called for sajida al rishawi to be handed over
she is a female jihadi imprisoned for her role in a two thousand and five suicide bombing at a wedding reception in jordan that killed dozens
if she wasn't brought to the turkish border by sunset thursday the militants said two hostages would die
japanese journalist kenji goto and jordanian pilot moaz al kassasbeh
the deadline has passed but the hostages fate is unknown
by negotiating with isis by recognizing them by even having dialogue with them it gives them the impression of acting as a state said <unk> gohel international security director at the asia pacific foundation
jordanian officials have said they are willing to swap al rishawi for the pilot
but they have demanded proof of life to demonstrate that al kassasbeh captured in december after his fighter jet crashed in syria is still alive
former fbi negotiator chris voss said jordan was absolutely right to do so and that the failure of isis so far to provide proof of life was suspicious
it's just a natural and ordinary course of <unk> in these types of negotiations and they are choosing not to do that at this point he said
the latest proposal by isis is not a prisoner exchange in the usual sense since the militants now want the release of al rishawi just in order not to kill the two hostages rather than promising their release
voss said entering into this kind of territory with terrorists was dangerous
if you engage in that sort of bargain then they can threaten to kill the same person over and over and over again and continue to demand release of hostages or whatever their demands are he said
you can't give in to that sort of thing because then it puts you in an endless loop where they have all the power
it's important to remember that for isis and groups like them the key factor is gain voss said
kidnappers are in a <unk> exchange business
while it's a horrifying concept to us to them it's business and it's the business isis is in and so you have to treat it like that
besides failed suicide bomber al rishawi isis wants two other women an alleged bomb maker and a woman tied to the head of isis and a child
each of the prisoners is symbolically and strategically important for the terror group
al rishawi is connected to isis through her brother once a ranking member of al qaeda in iraq which spawned isis
in exchange for american journalists james foley and later steven sotloff isis demanded the release of <unk> <unk> nicknamed lady al qaeda an imprisoned neuroscientist in the united states linked to nine eleven mastermind khalid sheikh mohammed
she was arrested in afghanistan in two thousand and eight carrying bomb making documents for a mass casualty chemical and biological weapons attack against american targets including the statue of liberty and the brooklyn bridge
one high profile prisoner who isis has not yet publicly demanded is <unk> al dulaimi
she may be the wife of shadowy isis leader abu bakr al baghdadi who fought with al qaeda in iraq though the iraqi interior ministry has disputed that
regional sources have told cnn that al dulaimi is herself a powerful isis figure arrested as a high value target as she crossed into lebanon with a four year old child whom one intelligence source identified as baghdadi's son
since their capture in march two thousand and fourteen baghdadi has been calling to get his child released a regional source said
in the past in similar cases governments have <unk>
last year the united states traded several taliban captives for sergeant bowe bergdahl who was captured by the extremist group almost five years earlier
despite claims that bergdahl may have abandoned his post before being kidnapped the state department defended the move saying it was nothing unusual
it is consistent absolutely with what's happened in previous wars including korea including vietnam said state department spokeswoman marie harf adding that there was a long history in the united states of prisoner swaps
complicating the debate one of the five taliban detainees released from guantanamo bay in return for bergdahl last may has attempted to return to militant activity from his current location in qatar by making contact with suspected taliban associates in afghanistan multiple officials told cnn on thursday
during the cold war the west also swapped hundreds of spies with communist bloc countries
in two thousand and eleven israel made a major made a major concession to its arch enemy the palestinian militant group hamas which runs gaza
it exchanged more than one thousand palestinian prisoners in return for the soldier <unk> <unk> who had been kidnapped in gaza in two thousand and six
hamas celebrated the deal as a major victory and the government of prime minister benjamin netanyahu was heavily criticized
duncan <unk> a uk based risk consultant says swapping prisoners for hostages is still better than paying for release of prisoners as some european countries do
the payment of cash ransom can been seen as the direct funding of terrorist organizations and for that reason and a few others is regarded as unacceptable certainly by the u.s. uk and increasingly other nations he said
there would be nothing unusual about the swapping of combatants and if the japanese victim is thrown in as part of the deal then that is a great bonus
it's sadly far from certain that goto and al kassasbeh will emerge from the current negotiations alive
but whether they gain the release of al rishawi or not isis leaders have very clearly achieved one goal

how times have changed in scotland's largest city
over the last three years celtic and rangers have been like strangers in the night as the financial capitulation of <unk> blue half pushed this once mighty pair to opposite poles of the scottish league system
the famous old firm fixture that at its best produced moments of majestic sporting theater and at its worst dragged in politics religious bigotry and vocal support for paramilitary groups like the irish republican army and <unk> volunteer force given the west of scotland's close historical links with northern ireland has been absent as a result
but not for much longer
celtic and rangers meet this weekend in what is sure to be a highly charged scottish league cup semifinal at <unk> park
the game is a sell out and <unk> respective green and blue tribes are <unk> with anticipation
a league above their great rivals celtic are overwhelming favorites
yet this football mad city's once proud sporting passions have <unk> in recent years on the field at least
<unk> have fallen significantly at both clubs while the quality of player on display is vastly inferior to what was on offer as little as five years ago
rangers have also arguably provided as an <unk> guide as is possible in demonstrating how not to run a football club
their fans are in <unk> organizing <unk> with regards ongoing <unk> battles and the club's perilous finances
the <unk> side required emergency loans from <unk> to pay wages and avoid being wound up only this month
protests and <unk> lines aside however a number of supporters told cnn that the dearth of old firm <unk> and the intense emotions they generate has also contributed to <unk> interests
with hindsight it's not difficult to see how things ended up here
years of <unk> <unk> ownership and the catastrophic adoption of employee benefit <unk> a financial vehicle designed to reduce the levels of income and national insurance tax companies pay saw rangers <unk> in spectacular fashion
the club <unk> into administration in early two thousand and twelve before winding up a matter of months later unable to find a <unk> willing to take on its imposing debts and a potentially large tax bill from outstanding court cases relating to <unk> use
a tribunal later found the majority of these did not break the law although the uk tax authorities are appealing this verdict
<unk> saw assets like the stadium training ground and some player contracts snapped up by a <unk> rangers which was then granted entry to the lowest tier of the scottish league system
but dispute still remains as to whether rangers are actually the same club
they've since made their way to the scottish championship the division below the country's top league
celtic fans and those of many other scottish teams claim their great rivals died upon <unk>
they have <unk> taken to <unk> this opinion at games by passing coffins <unk> with the <unk> <unk>
backed up by songs <unk> to zombies
a group of celtic fans even went to the trouble of paying for a full page <unk> in a sunday <unk> last weekend to state their position on the new rangers club and how the term old firm is now defunct
unsurprisingly rangers supporters see things differently
they state their team remains the same entity as it was the company which ran the club which was <unk> and not the club itself
the head of the scottish professional football league neil <unk> stated in a bbc interview earlier this year that he agrees with the latter assessment
however the organization declined the opportunity to respond to requests cnn made to its public relations representatives about clarifying whether this position related solely to <unk> rules or to the stricter court of <unk> law as well
to the players at least these dramas are a <unk> to matters on the field
some celtic stars have openly confessed to missing the challenge of their great rivals
when defender charlie <unk> was asked in two thousand and thirteen whether he would like rangers back in the scottish <unk> he responded with a <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> of the positive in the scottish <unk>
these feelings are shared in a more expansive manner by former professionals who <unk> about the <unk> and excitement the old firm games bring
there's a level of <unk> that you won't see in any other game said ex celtic captain tom boyd adding
there really is nothing like it
former rangers midfielder ian <unk> agrees
recalling his own experiences as a player he said you only have to look at the buildup to this game to realize it's different from all the others
it takes over everything in the city
in workplaces on the streets in sports clubs in restaurants
it's all anybody talks about he added
the buzz <unk> describes has <unk> itself in many ways over the years not least in displays of colorful support and backing
however this intensity has on occasion boiled over into something more <unk> and crowd <unk> at old firm games can be traced back as far as the early years of the twenty th century
in more recent times former celtic manager neil lennon was sent a <unk> bomb in two thousand and eleven while rangers striker <unk> <unk> claimed in two thousand and eight that he received death threats
although the <unk> characterization of celtic being the catholic team and rangers their protestant rivals may no longer reflect the wider realities of life in glasgow a hard core among each support still <unk> <unk> to these identities when in the stadium
here chants containing the lyrics we're up to our knees in <unk> blood surrender or you'll die and when i was just a <unk> like you i joined the <unk> can still be heard on match days
this phenomenon the fan who <unk> extreme political and religious opinions when at the match but not in other aspects of his or her daily life has come to be known in scotland as the ninety minute <unk>
as journalist and author simon <unk> noted as far back as the early one thousand nine hundred and ninety s although old firm fans seem to no longer believe in god they enjoy hating each other too much to stop
the fear among many in the city is that this sunday's clash could see three years of pent up frustration and tension released with unpredictable results
<unk> herald newspaper quoted an unnamed police source last week as saying there could be more trouble than usual at the game
thankfully however the glasgow <unk> is not all <unk> bigotry and <unk> as a number of fans and people involved in the scottish game who spoke to cnn were quick to emphasize
hardly surprising given the fixture provides a welcome economic boost for the city as thousands descend on match day
a two thousand and five report from the university of <unk> estimated the old firm fixture was worth upwards of one hundred and twenty million to the national economy every year
celtic ceo peter <unk> has acknowledged rangers troubles have had a direct impact on his own club's bottom line
while maintaining that celtic have continued to flourish without their great rivals <unk> estimated in two thousand and fourteen that rangers absence has cost celtic at least ten million a year in revenue
these trends have been reflected in the scottish game's own commercial struggles
the country's top division has been unable to secure a sponsor for the last two years while this season's league cup only attracted a backer when the old firm were paired together
more positively though scottish football is currently far more unpredictable than at any time in the last thirty years
aberdeen and st <unk> were <unk> in the cup competitions of two thousand and fourteen
the current league season meanwhile has seen celtic challenged at the top of the <unk> by <unk> united <unk> <unk> <unk> and aberdeen
this newfound competitiveness has been welcomed by those who run the country's national game
but according to chief executive of the scottish football association stewart <unk> the size and reputation of the old firm ensures it remains one of the country's biggest selling points
from an economic point of view it's important <unk> said of the fixture
for broadcasters we know how important
the old firm game is
<unk> suggests a strong rangers is key to the development of scottish football as a whole
they've been through some difficult times but hopefully they're on their way back
we would like to see a strong scottish football with as many big city teams as we can he added
the idea of scottish football needing rangers is an argument not all fans buy into
many who don't support the old firm believe the game would be more competitive and enjoyable without the sectarian baggage the glasgow clubs bring
not that opinions like that will receive much attention come sunday
<unk> will be privy to the same passions <unk> and questionable back <unk> of political and sectarian <unk> that have always been part of old firm experience
although few supporters on either side will admit it their anticipation of the fixture suggests they too have missed one another as much for the opportunity of <unk> it potentially offers
this is a point recognized by <unk> <unk> co editor of the rangers standard website and the book on rangers fan culture in relation to the scottish independence referendum born under a union flag
i'm sure there will be fans on both sides that will <unk> at the very idea of the two clubs being linked and they hate the term old firm <unk> said
but i think there's definitely an element of truth to that
a glance on social media sites such as twitter only seems to reinforce this analysis
supporters of each side have continued to <unk> one another in spite of there being little sporting contact between the clubs in recent years
one celtic supporter who cnn spoke with last wednesday before the club's <unk> fixture with <unk> described wanting to see rangers <unk> completely
although not unique this isn't typical of all fans
matt <unk> of the celtic <unk> the alternative view describes rangers as a tribute act due to their <unk>
he believes celtic don't need rangers but concedes the rivalry between supporters is still there
it's a particularly high buzz beating rangers that lasts for days he said
some fans say we don't need them and i can understand that point of view
but maybe fans will alter their opinion once we beat them
whether celtic supporters of this mindset would admit to that is another matter
for prominent rangers fans like <unk> <unk> director of supporters group rangers first celtic fans who say they don't care about the rivalry are not being honest
any celtic fan that says they don't want rangers back i think they're lying
he added i think both celtic and rangers need each other
the has been boring without us
win or lose new club or same club the <unk> and one <unk> between these two clubs and sets of supporters will continue well beyond sunday
as always in glasgow some may choose to recognize this while others may not

since one thousand nine hundred and ninety five mclaren has been using mercedes benz engines but after two difficult seasons in f one their new deal with the japanese car manufacturer <unk> one of the most successful partnerships in <unk> elite class
the first few races i predict will be problematic as we wrestle with what we hope are performance advantages and inevitably performance advantages sometimes carry <unk> with them dennis told cnn's amanda davies in an exclusive interview
once we've got that in control i think our competitiveness will be quickly established and i feel when coupled to two world champions and the talents of fernando alonso and <unk> button i think that the outcome i hope will be inevitable
that we'll return to our winning ways he added
during those <unk> days of domination mclaren and honda won forty four out of the eighty grand prix they raced as <unk> <unk> and alain <unk> secured a clean sweep of world titles between one thousand nine hundred and eighty eight and one thousand nine hundred and ninety one
it was the type of stranglehold mercedes had over f one last season when world champion lewis hamilton and teammate nico <unk> at times appeared to be only racing against one another
last year mercedes won all but three of the <unk> races finishing with at least one car on the podium at every single race
while admitting to a degree of <unk> dennis believes mclaren which signed a multi year global partnership with cnn at the start of two thousand and fifteen are not too far behind mercedes the team predicted to once again dominate the new season that gets underway with the australian grand prix on march fifteen
it's unlikely that anybody has surpassed the efforts of mercedes benz
and in sheer <unk> terms we don't really fear the mercedes benz engine added the mclaren boss
for <unk> fans the one thousand nine hundred and eighty eight mclaren honda mp four car is one of f one most historic pieces of machinery after it won all but one of the sixteen races that season
speaking to cnn ahead of the launch of the team's new car thursday dennis conceded it was unlikely that the new incarnation of the partnership would be able to replicate that level of success preferring to emphasize that alonso and button were key to <unk> hopes of success
the tendency of the regulations at the moment is to put more control back to the driver said the mclaren ceo as he compared f one's pilots to automotive musicians
dennis added
he has to be able to play with these devices and optimize the performance of the car sometimes even during the lap
so driver <unk> is going to play a very significant role in the future of grand prix racing until there's another regulation change
but managing two world champions is never easy as mclaren and dennis discovered when alonso left after just one season with the team due to tensions between the spaniard and then rookie teammate hamilton
before alonso returned to mclaren for a second spell dennis conceded that a great amount of time was spent talking between the two of them about what had gone on before
i have to say it's more about the future than about the past
that as a topic was really about one third of the discussion and it was quickly dealt with
i mean we're older people
while <unk> seat at mclaren was <unk> out five or six races before the end of the season button was left to sweat over his f one future
eventually he signed a new deal to extend his four year stay with the team in december with his services <unk> above kevin <unk> who stayed on as a test and reserve driver
these drivers had contracts through to the end of two thousand and fourteen so there's no <unk> necessity and i was absolutely open to both drivers about what the process was said dennis
so i can understand the fuss but the fact is we're a business
we're a sport in a business there's a right time to take the decision and the right time to take the decision was the time it was taken
if it had been appropriate to take it sooner we would have done
to tackle energy poverty many entrepreneurs are increasingly <unk> innovative solutions to explore feasible alternative power options
one of them is rose twine
having grown up in both urban and rural areas of uganda twine knew first hand the challenges faced by many homes when it came to cooking a simple meal
a passionate environmentalist she decided to do something about it
in two thousand and nine she teamed up with her brother to found their kampala based company with their flagship product
the eco stove
the siblings green oven uses a type of volcanic rock combined with solar power to act as the fuel for the kitchen appliance
the whole point was to
reduce <unk> as well as the <unk> involved in finding <unk> for the local person who can't access electricity or gas explains twine
the stove has an internal air system that helps heat up the volcanic rocks which are ready to cook when they turn bright red in color
when the device is switched off the rocks cool and return to their natural state until the next use
meanwhile solar panels on the appliance charge up and help provide additional heat to the stove
<unk> twine explains the appliance can also be used to provide an additional light source charge cell phones play a radio or even iron clothes through <unk>
at the moment the most common solid fuels for cooking and heating homes in uganda are <unk> and charcoal both of which release thick <unk> smoke into the household
this <unk> residents to a number of respiratory health problems the world health organization estimates that four point three million people die annually as a result of hazardous household air pollution
as the ugandan capital of kampala continues to flourish more people are choosing to relocate to the city
but an increasing population also means more man made health factors
societal problems include extra trash and traffic which in turn add to the worsening air pollution
outside of the city in rural areas the once green and fertile forests are disappearing at an alarming rate
<unk> has seen the country lose two thirds of its forests between one thousand nine hundred and ninety and two thousand and five making it harder for villagers to find wood for burning
twine hopes her product will provide users with immediate environmental social health and economic benefits once they have upgraded their existing <unk> with her eco alternative
she says
everybody says i want because charcoal is expensive <unk> is hard to find electricity is very expensive and its not reliable
surrounded by countless families facing these hardships of accessing sustainable energy everyday twine made it her mission to provide a reliable fuel source through her social enterprise startup
it's a vision that has proved fairly popular as more kampala residents adopt this eco friendly way of cooking
but twine explains it usually requires a live demonstration of the product to <unk> the sale
this is a new innovation in the continent that a lot of people need more understanding
it's not something that you can go on tv and say this a stove here that will solve all your cooking challenges
no
that's why we are always cooking beans
you need a lot of stuff on site to be able to demonstrate for anybody who comes in because it's not something somebody is going to read about it and say a stone that cooks and lasts two years and believe in it
no they want to see
it's still early days but the sustainable business has seen some local success in promoting renewable energy a cause of great importance to twine
and it's this passion that spurs the environmental entrepreneur <unk>
she explains
believe in the dream i think you'll go all the way
once you believe in it it's easy to transmit the same passion and the same conviction to the person who is going to buy into it
once you believe in what you're doing don't be distracted and don't even be discouraged

for months isis has been facing off with the peshmerga armed fighters who protect iraqi kurdistan to the west of kirkuk
it had gone into areas on <unk> outskirts but not the central city
heavily armed militants attacked an abandoned hotel in central kirkuk that local police had used as their headquarters
peshmerga and kurdish anti terror units later raided the hotel <unk> control of it from the militants and killing three of them according to peshmerga sources
in addition two suicide bombers detonated themselves in an attempt to keep the kurdish forces out
also friday isis militants took over <unk> khalid an area about twelve miles southwest of kirkuk after heavy clashes with the peshmerga
among those killed was brig
gen. <unk> <unk> the highest ranking operational commander of the peshmerga brigade located in kirkuk
photos posted by isis purportedly show the group's militants in control of parts of south and southwest kirkuk burning tents that had been used by peshmerga troops
the u.s. military said friday that an isis chemical weapons expert was killed during a coalition strike late last week
abu malik worked in saddam <unk> chemical weapons program before joining al qaeda in two thousand and five u.s. central command said
he was killed january twenty four near mosul
his death is expected to temporarily degrade and disrupt the terrorist network and diminish ability to potentially produce and use chemical weapons against innocent people the military said
there is no public evidence that isis has a dedicated weapons of mass destruction program
but u.s. central command said
his past training and experience provided the terrorist group with expertise to pursue a chemical weapons capability
kirkuk is a strategically important city in the months long fight one that has pitted isis against the peshmerga iraqi government troops and an international coalition that has carried out airstrikes against the terrorist group
it is one of the few notable cities apart from the region of kurdistan and its capital <unk> in northern iraq that haven't fallen to isis
part of its significance stems from the fact its oil reserves are almost as much as those in southern iraq
the kurds and the central iraqi government in baghdad have long <unk> over control of those reserves with each side wanting to keep hold of them
isis which relies heavily on revenue from oil smuggling to fund its operations has been <unk> them too
peshmerga forces took over the kirkuk area in june when the iraqi army crumbled in the face of isis advances and have played a vital role in defending it from isis since
in december isis claimed responsibility for a suicide car bomb attack there that killed at least seventeen people and injured more than twenty
the attack according to isis was meant to send a message to the kurdish people and peshmerga fighters
still kirkuk is hardly the only place that has seen recent fighting which may be part of isis rationale for friday's attack there
the group has been fending off an offensive from peshmerga fighters around mosul iraq's second largest city and a focal point for all sides in the conflict that has left the sunni extremist group on its heels
the city of one point five million people on the <unk> river has been held by isis since june
isis has invested heavily in governing the city
its leader abu bakr al baghdadi pronounced his leadership of the caliphate at the grand mosque there in july
kurdish officials say that as long as isis holds mosul it threatens kurdistan
likewise neither the government in baghdad nor its coalition partners can rest while terrorists occupy iraq's second largest city
peshmerga forces have made steady progress against isis north and west of mosul over the past two months
they have taken some three thousand square kilometers of the sinjar area as well as the area around the mosul dam choking off access routes and threatening isis main resupply routes
there's little doubt though that isis remains a very real force and threat in much of iraq
the group which calls itself the islamic state still controls a vast swath of that middle eastern nation and neighboring syria
its goal is to have a vast caliphate under its strict version of sharia law with its followers proving they will stop at nothing having been blamed for the large scale killings of civilians mass kidnappings and forcing women and girls to become sex slaves during its quest
that violent campaign continued friday and not just in kirkuk
dozens of gunmen believed to be from isis faced off friday morning about one hundred and seventy five miles away in central ramadi police and health officials in that city said
several hours later that onslaught had been foiled and twenty gunmen were dead according to the officials
elsewhere in ramadi a suicide car bomb explosion at an iraqi army checkpoint killed one soldier and wounded six others
violence flared in other parts of iraq as well that while it hasn't been tied to isis is further proof of the country's unsettled state
six explosions went off friday around baghdad leaving at least seven dead and twenty three wounded according to police officials
the deadliest such blast was in <unk> al <unk> a busy commercial area in central baghdad leaving three dead and ten hurt
the unidentified man wanted ten fifteen minutes to tell his story the director of the <unk> state broadcaster told cnn
he put a gun to the head of a guard who took him to a studio that was not in use said jan de jong
video from inside the studio shows a man with a weapon pacing and wearing a black suit with a white shirt black tie
police can then be heard shouting and he drops his weapon
they approach and arrest him
no shots were fired and there were no <unk> reported
the building was evacuated and authorities were working to clear the station
after more than thirty years eddie murphy is returning to saturday night live
the comedy legend will appear on the forty th anniversary special of the nbc sketch comedy show
the special airs february fifteen
murphy who started his stand up comedy career at fifteen was nineteen when he joined the show in one thousand nine hundred and eighty one
his last appearance was as host in one thousand nine hundred and eighty four by which time he had become a mega movie star with beverly hills cop
in an interview with news one now murphy talked about why it took so long for him to return
it just never worked out where the timing was right for me to do it he said
they're having a forty th anniversary
i'm going to that
and that will be the first time i've been back since i left
the <unk> also <unk> in music periodically scoring a top ten hit in one thousand nine hundred and eighty five with party all the time
on tuesday he released his latest
a <unk> number called oh <unk> <unk>
while the show has been praised for its potential to <unk> stereotypes its social media team <unk> when it tweeted a graphic featuring caricatures of different races underneath the phrase we're all a little <unk>
if anything the ad reinforced tired imagery
one asian figure wore a <unk> bamboo hat
another latino figure wore a <unk> with a curly <unk>
story creator eddie huang whose <unk> the <unk> is based on was furious
this is plain offensive and ridiculous he tweeted
someone please reverse this
at least they didn't do the native american with chicken <unk> <unk> <unk>
point isn't whether we in fact wear <unk> and rice hats but it's <unk> he added
wall street journal columnist jeff yang whose son hudson stars in the series tweeted that the ad was awful
the controversy came just weeks after huang publicly slammed the show's producers in a lengthy new york magazine piece accusing the network of <unk> his memoir into a <unk> story about asian americans <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> pan in order to make it more appealing to white audiences
but he later backed off the comments in a panel discussion on the issue saying he didn't have a problem with the show's executive producer and felt his memoir published in two thousand and thirteen was portrayed fairly
there was also an awkward moment at the discussion when a journalist asked the show's cast whether the <unk> would involve <unk>
the ad also <unk> online debate over another contentious part of the <unk>
its name
the phrase fresh off the boat typically shortened to the acronym <unk> is a loaded phrase many young american immigrants will recognize
depending on who you ask it's either a slang term or a <unk> used to label minorities often asian american who haven't fully <unk> with the mainstream
huang deals with the term in his memoir also named fresh off the boat recalling a moment he heard it being used to insult his father
he never forgot it he writes
we weren't americans like everyone else
we'd always be the other in this <unk> country
<unk> oh a history professor at boston college says the term is painful because it <unk> with asian americans always having to negotiate the fear of being perceived as a perpetual foreigner
because the consequences can be anything from bullying and <unk> to violence or internment
but huang and yang have argued that naming the show fresh off the boat is an expression of immigrant pride and can help to reclaim the term as something positive
it's a term whose <unk> should and can be removed yang tells cnn
but only if we have an honest and open discussion about what it means to be american and why a nation of immigrants remains so hostile toward those who are newly arrived
concerns over the phrase aren't new
when the show was announced last may some asian americans worried openly what if the show inadvertently encourages people to toss the phrase around in an offensive way
what if instead of <unk> america's understanding of the immigrants difficulties the show simply gives people another opportunity to mock them
perhaps some argue these thorny issues only get harder to <unk> when they're thrust into the mainstream
as oh explains i sort of feel like <unk> is a family issue you know like internal to asian americans
we need to reclaim it or something first before we put it out there in front of other people
but the show is stepping into the spotlight next week
and even its strongest supporters are nervous
we're all hoping that this works says yang
because twenty years of wandering in the wilderness is damn well enough
there have been countless attempts by <unk> to ride down both parts of niagara falls the american falls on the u.s. side and horseshoe falls on the canadian side
but earlier this week gadd made history when he became the first person to <unk> up the falls
the canadian ice <unk> used only ice <unk> to scale the frozen cliffs at <unk> point a one hundred and forty seven foot section directly next to horseshoe falls
i checked out the spot we were thinking of climbing in the summer
you'd be swept away by the <unk> <unk> then gadd said on <unk> dot com
on a warm winter there's no climb here
but on a cold freezing day in late january the wall of water is a wall of ice the icing is so heavy that the area is closed to tourists during the winter months a perfect scenario for gadd
he <unk> up the frozen walls three times taking about an hour each trip according to <unk> dot com
gadd described the ice as unstable because it formed in distinct layers of ice and snow which made the climb more difficult
that climb beat me up he said
i may have reached the top but niagara won the war
at the end of the day i was hypothermic
indeed <unk> biggest challenges in the climb seemed to be getting really cold and really wet
as he climbed right next to him six hundred and eighty one thousand seven hundred and fifty gallons of water per second surged down horseshoe falls
i was so close to the water i could reach out and stick my ice tool in the niagara falls gadd told <unk> dot com
at one point i was behind the water climbing on ice that froze behind the falls
i got a whole lot of niagara down my neck
scaling the falls is the latest feat for gadd who was recently named a <unk> <unk> adventurer of the year
he's also a three time gold <unk> at the x games and won the ice climbing world cup according to his website
it was dawn and police officer <unk> <unk> <unk> suarez was in the middle of <unk> up for work
the shock wave jolted his station like an earthquake
it swung the doors and windows
suarez and his colleagues went outside
they told us there was an explosion he told cnn affiliate <unk>
only half equipped he jumped straight into his squad car
we left as we were he said
and rushed to the site marked by broad <unk> of smoke and dust towering over the city
the hose of a propane butane truck had burst while it made a delivery to the <unk> maternal hospital
<unk> gas had <unk> out into the neighborhood
residents had already called firefighters to alert them to the leak minutes before the gas ignited and the hospital had already begun <unk>
but the <unk> hit them in the middle of it
more than one hundred people were still in the building
officer suarez arrived to find the hospital for newborns and their mothers leveled to crumbled concrete and twisted steel
people stained in blood were screaming for help
he and the other officers went straight into the wreckage looking for injured survivors
he turned over pieces of the collapsed roof to see if victims were under them
i saw a sheet that was moving very slightly he said
picking it up i saw that the baby was face down with its head and knees in the rubble
the baby did not appear to be terribly injured suarez told <unk>
he had small wounds
he had <unk>
what i did was just wrap him up and pick him up and leave running
holding the baby in his left arm suarez signaled with his right hand to colleagues directing them to go inside to help more injured people
my first feeling was to do the work any human being would do to take out the injured he told cnn
everything else you block out
at that moment someone snapped a photo of him as he <unk> over <unk> pieces of debris
suarez handed the baby to paramedics grabbed a <unk> and ran back to search for more victims
the only thing on my mind was to do the human thing he said when asked if he thought about his own children
at that moment you don't remember if you have family a mother a father children or a wife
you concentrate on helping
i wasn't the only one to go in there
my colleagues also rescued victims
a public safety official sent it out via twitter with the message
i would like to know what happened with the baby
our work is to save lives says <unk> after <unk> a baby from the explosion
yes i would like to know that he is ok the baby he said choking up
in the evening mexico city's health secretary <unk> <unk> spoke to reporters about the tragedy
a nurse died he said as well as two babies
dozens were injured about a third of them children
reporters asked him about the newborn in the tweeted photo
the baby was one of the two who didn't make it
it was a baby that had
a very serious <unk> in its head and unfortunately died <unk> said
it's very sad news suarez told cnnmexico
he has two grown children himself
he sent a message to the baby's parents
i will be with them in their pain

there was nothing to separate guinea and mali after the group stage at the african cup of nations so lots had to be drawn to decide which team would progress to the quarterfinals
on this occasion luck favored guinea one of the nations in west africa ravaged by the ebola virus
it was a rare the last time lots were drawn at the continental tournament was in one thousand nine hundred and eighty eight and unfair way to settle second place in group d according to both managers but ultimately it's guinea boss michel <unk> and his team that will face ghana on sunday in <unk> equatorial guinea
two balls numbered <unk> for second place and <unk> for third place were placed in a bowl and the rest was left to chance thursday
<unk> <unk> from the finance division of the guinea ministry of sports picked the ball numbered <unk> and <unk> diarra president of the mali football federation was the loser after picking out ball number <unk> africa's governing body said on its website
the outcome left diarra in tears and former mali international frederic <unk> tweeted his displeasure about the method used to separate the sides

the agency tasked with overseeing u.s. reconstruction efforts in afghanistan released their quarterly report to congress on thursday featuring a series of glaring <unk>
the office of the special inspector general for afghanistan reconstruction better known as sigar said in its report summary they were unable to present a complete evaluation of reconstruction spending within the report because key data was <unk> by the military and the state department at least in an unclassified format
the most glaring omission is the absence of information from the afghan national security forces classified by the defense department for the first time this quarter
additional data on the <unk> was classified last quarter by the international security assistance force
pentagon spokesman lt. col. chris belcher said the decision was made to address potential concerns about operational security
we appreciate understand and support sigar's responsibility to provide information to congress and the american public belcher said in a statement
at the same time we have a responsibility to protect data that could jeopardize the operational security of our afghan partners to include unnecessarily highlighting possible vulnerabilities and capability gaps
belcher said the afghan government requested the u.s. not disclose readiness data from the afghan national security forces
according to the sigar report congress has <unk> more than sixty five billion dollar to the afghan forces to date more than half of the approximately one hundred and four billion dollar <unk> for relief and reconstruction in afghanistan generally
sigar expressed concern about these decisions in its report and said that earlier this month the military retroactively classified other information it had submitted to the agency only days earlier
because of the newly classified nature of the data portions of the quarterly report are now only available to members of congress in a classified <unk> and are not available to the public

this <unk> sigar report was also compiled without input from the state department on some of their funding efforts
that report noted that while federal agencies are legally required to submit requested data to sigar the state department did not answer any of sigar's questions on economic and social development this quarter and failed to respond to sigar's attempts to follow up
asked to comment state department spokeswoman jen psaki said her department did not purposefully keep data from the agency
this quarter it took longer than expected to collect and <unk> the requested information and our response on social and economic issues missed the reporting deadline psaki said at a press briefing on thursday
we did however convey the delay to sigar and we did not intentionally withhold information for these quarterly reports
we expect it will be complete in the next quarter with all of the details across the board she said
the attacker in the thursday incident was a taliban agent who had <unk> into the security forces and was waiting for such a target for a long time a spokesman for the group <unk> <unk> said friday
yesterday in the evening he managed to get to a crowd of invading and <unk> american military forces where he turned his gun towards them and opened fire he added
during the gun battle <unk> was also killed by the enemy
a u.s. military official earlier told cnn the three american were contractors not active duty forces
it is in their benefit as well and the benefit of all us <unk> <unk> a former diplomat told cnn on friday
isis should set moaz al kassasbeh free in order to gain more sympathy in the region <unk> said
otherwise they will get the anger of the whole people of jordan and the anger of the whole world he said
isis had pushed jordan to bring a convicted terrorist sajida al rishawi to the turkish border by thursday evening
the jordanians didn't so governments and relatives were still waiting friday to see whether isis followed through on its threat to kill al kassasbeh followed by the beheading of a japanese journalist kenji goto
another of the pilot's uncles <unk> al kasasbeh said the family hasn't received any information from official sources
and there has been no proof of life from isis
but we hope he is still alive <unk> said
al kassasbeh's father safi made a similar appeal for his son's release thursday after the sunset deadline
jordanian officials have said they are willing to swap al rishawi for the pilot
but jordan's key condition is proof that al kassasbeh is still alive
at this point we want to emphasize that we have asked for proof of life and we have not received anything as of yet government spokesman mohammed al momani said thursday afternoon about an hour before the purported deadline
the lack of proof of the pilot's health is concerning but al kasasbeh said the family had received some information from unofficial sources that was comforting
kidnappers are in a <unk> exchange business said chris voss a former fbi hostage negotiator
and proof of life is part of this type of negotiation
the jordanians have no business going forward until they get it
al kassasbeh was captured after he ejected from his f sixteen jet last month near raqqa the extremist group's de facto capital in syria
coalition warplanes and drones continue flying over isis strongholds in northern syria looking for any signs of unusual activity perhaps a convoy moving toward the border with turkey
given the fact that isis has executed every hostage that they have publicly produced on a <unk> except one british hostage it does suggest that isis is not that interested in serious negotiations and is <unk> interested in the ability to get a lot of attention for its cause said peter bergen cnn's national security analyst
the forty seven year old goto left japan last fall when his youngest daughter was three weeks old
his wife rinko who heard from his captors first on december two and most recently in a wednesday email with their final demand pleaded for his return
i hope our oldest daughter who is just two will get to see her father again his wife rinko said
thursday's deadline was the third that isis set in less than a week
the wait began with a video showing two japanese hostages goto and aspiring security contractor haruna yukawa
and an outrageous demand from isis
a two hundred million dollar ransom from japan within seventy two hours or else both captives die
the first deadline passed a week ago friday
grim proof soon followed
an image of goto holding what appeared to be a photo of yukawa's <unk> body
what it shows is that they are reacting <unk> said cnn military analyst <unk>
lt. gen. mark <unk>
they no longer have a strategic plan
they are just trying to get the best thing going
days later came a change in demands
isis now sought the release of al rishawi a female jihadist imprisoned in jordan for her role in a two thousand and five suicide bombing at a wedding reception that killed dozens
and if the swap wasn't made the group threatened to kill both the pilot and the journalist
wednesday night brought yet another deadline
deliver al rishawi to the turkish border by sunset thursday or al kassasbeh and goto would die
the relentless back and forth has raised hard questions about whether isis is truly negotiating and whether jordan made a mistake to try
they are attempting to elevate themselves into some sort of status as a political movement and a state <unk> said
they are not
they are terrorists
andrew chan and myuran sukumaran aged thirty one and thirty three respectively were sentenced to death in two thousand and six for leading the so called bali nine trafficking ring that attempted to smuggle eight kilograms of heroin to australia
successive appeals have failed to have their sentences <unk> and both are on a list of inmates scheduled to die by firing squad
on friday their indonesian lawyer filed what's known as a <unk> to apply for a second judicial review
it has been accepted it will go to the courts then it depends on the district court heads <unk> <unk> <unk> told media in bali
there should not be an execution because the legal process should be respected as well
the court will be asked to consider the men's rehabilitation during ten years of detention in <unk> <unk> prison
chan now leads church prayers and is said to be a source of spiritual strength for other prisoners while sukumaran mentors other inmates in daily art classes
however a spokesman for indonesian attorney general <unk> <unk> tony <unk> told cnn that at a meeting held on january nine it was decided that only one judicial review would be allowed
he said the meeting included representatives from the attorney general's office the ministry of law and human rights the investigative department of the national police the national anti drug agency and officials from the supreme court and constitutional court and other related institutions
lawyers for the men have pointed to a constitutional court ruling in two thousand and thirteen which cleared the way for a second judicial review
however <unk> said that ruling wasn't effective because the relevant regulations hadn't been implemented
until they were he said we have to stick to the old rule that says judicial review is only possible for one time
the australians are not the only foreigners awaiting execution by an indonesia firing squad

after the most recent executions which were the first since two thousand and thirteen indonesia's president joko widodo told cnn's christiane amanpour that too many indonesian lives were being lost to drugs

the united nations high commissioner for human rights has expressed concern about the use of the death penalty for drug offenses

the long skeleton was found in two thousand and six by farmers digging for a fish pond in qijiang city in the southwestern chongqing province
<unk> <unk> a member of the research team from the university of alberta who made the discovery told cnn it was named qijianglong the dragon of qijiang because farmers thought the bones resembled the shape of chinese mythical dragons
we found the <unk> huge <unk> with the skull and the tail but couldn't find any bones from the hands or the legs
so the locals began to say the long body looked just like a dragon from ancient chinese stories said <unk>
the findings published earlier this week in the journal of <unk> <unk> show that the new species belongs to a group of dinosaurs called <unk> known for their extremely long necks which would measure up to half their body length
most <unk> or long <unk> dinosaurs such as those depicted in the popular animated series the land before time have necks that span only one third of their body length
qijianglong is a cool animal
if you imagine a big animal that is half neck you can see that evolution can do quite extraordinary things <unk> <unk> a phd student at the university of alberta said in a press release
the dinosaur is the youngest addition to the <unk> group which is only found in asia
the discovery suggests that there may be other species of long necks within the <unk> from different continents
qijianglong shows that long <unk> dinosaurs <unk> in unique ways in asia during <unk> times something very special was going on in that continent said <unk>
nowhere else we can find dinosaurs with longer necks than those in china
the new dinosaur tells us that these extreme species thrived in isolation from the rest of the world
the skeleton is now housed in a museum in qijiang but will be moved to a new dinosaur museum in the city that is currently being built
how much do you really know about dinosaurs
they have little doubt that the <unk> college <unk> and his big brother built a couple of pressure <unk> bombs and blew up the finish line of the two thousand and thirteen boston marathon
three people died including a little boy and later an mit campus cop
countless other lives were forever changed and nobody in the birthplace of liberty feels quite as safe as they did before
don't take my word for it
let the good people of the jury pool tell you for themselves
i am set in my ways and this kid is guilty
if i get picked i know how i'm voting
guilty
everyone thinks he is guilty
caught red handed should not waste the dollar on the trial
we all know he's guilty so quit wasting everybody's time with a jury and string him up
waste of time they should have already killed him
they shouldn't waste the <unk> <unk> or poison
hang them
people actually wrote these things on their official <unk> <unk>
and it continued in person in court
one woman looked like a promising prospect until she said she agreed with friends who told her we should just skip the trial and go straight to sentencing
not so fast people
that's not who we are
i can't help but think of the trial drama twelve angry men and that famous line written by <unk> rose
it's not easy for me to raise my hand and send a boy off to die without talking about it first
at the john joseph <unk> federal courthouse here they've been talking about it for nine days
we've heard one hundred and fourteen people <unk> <unk> and <unk>
united states of america vs. tsarnaev pits some of the best anti terrorism prosecutors against some of the best death penalty defense lawyers the nation's legal system has to offer
they sit at two conference tables pushed together in the center of an <unk> modern courtroom in a building that <unk> boston harbor
with a dozen lawyers assembled it's no surprise that picking a jury is slow going
what is surprising is that so many of <unk> supposed peers are convinced of his guilt without hearing one word of testimony
it also has been fascinating to watch people wrap their heads around something they don't usually think about in massachusetts the death penalty
the jurors will have two tasks
first they will have to determine whether tsarnaev who is twenty one is guilty of some thirty federal crimes which include terrorism counts and intentionally killing people with weapons of mass destruction
since seventeen of the counts carry possible death sentences jurors then will have to decide whether he should pay for those crimes with his life
so the stakes are about as high as stakes can get
i love a good trial and long ago lost count of how many i've covered
but in each one i've experienced the same thing
the lawyers ask me and other reporters what we think
how am i doing
how's it playing
they're hungry for feedback
but we always tell them that it doesn't matter what we think
it matters what the jury thinks
they know they know
still lawyers in high profile cases come to view some of the press gallery <unk> as thirteen th jurors
they <unk> our stories for hints of how the case is going
is my strategy working
is that witness believable
is my cross examination hitting the mark
because this trial is being held in federal court there will be no cameras
instead you'll have me writing weekly as the thirteen th <unk>
it's a filter true but remember this ain't my first rodeo
already this trial reminds me of two others i covered
<unk> and erik menendez gunned down their parents in beverly hills
like dzhokhar tsarnaev erik menendez was nineteen when the crime was committed and his lawyers argued that he was under the sway of an older brother
and sara jane <unk> a respectable doctor's wife was tried for trying to blow up police cars during her days with the <unk> liberation army the same <unk> political radicals who kidnapped heiress patty <unk>
<unk> was arrested after twenty three years on the run and pleaded guilty when prosecutors started using the word terrorist to describe her
the trial of tsarnaev the wannabe jihadist whose profile selfie wound up on the cover of rolling stone promises to be full of <unk> issues dealing with the war on terror that has <unk> our lives since nine eleven
a look through the <unk> court file <unk> me in as to where this case is headed
prosecutors are going to paint the brothers tsarnaev as terrorists
the defense is going to try to portray their client as a mixed up <unk> under the influence of his more radicalized big brother
one question that remains unanswered
did the brothers act on their own or at the behest of someone else
the truth is wannabes who blow things up are every bit as scary as real jihadists
timothy <unk> who is often referred to as a home grown terrorist blew up a federal building in oklahoma city with a homemade bomb made partly out of fertilizer
he paid for that with his life
it's not always about isis and al qaeda
terror is in the eye of the terrified
as jury selection <unk> along i am reminded that this is the <unk> lesson part of any trial
many reporters skip it
but most big cases are won or lost during this process
it gives you a deep dive into the human petri dish
it's important to know the twelve people sitting in judgment as best as you can
granted they are on their very best behavior the first time we meet them
then the lawyers poke and <unk> and pick trying to uncover the secret agendas
ask somebody right out are you <unk> against my client
and the answer likely will be no
that's when the real work begins
one woman for example seemed like a perfect <unk>
but she <unk> about how much she used social media
the defense checked out her twitter account
there it was a profane tweet <unk> <unk> arrest
another man posted a <unk> cartoon on facebook showing the boy from the old calvin and <unk> comic strip <unk> on the isis flag
for a while it was his profile photo
he said in court that he thought it was funny
the defense team knows it is waging an uphill battle
<unk> lawyers asked three times now to move the trial out of boston
they've been repeatedly turned down
in their most recent filing on friday they said nearly three weeks of conversations with individual jurors convinced them any chance of finding a fair jury is damaged beyond repair
they said u.s. district judge james <unk> jr. should halt jury selection <unk>
the defense included recent magazine covers with graphic photos of bombing victims in its most recent court documents along with heavily redacted <unk> from the jury prospects postings on social media
included was the viral photo of a man shoveling the marathon finish line after this week's snowstorm
the defense argued that the photo and its popularity show how strong the bias is against the bombings and their client
but the <unk> a bartender at a social club nearby told the boston globe he wasn't thinking about tsarnaev or the bombings
he said he cleared the finish line because he loves the marathon
the truth is unless you can find twelve <unk> who have been living in caves without cable or the internet it will be impossible to find anyone who hasn't heard something about the bombs that went off at the boston marathon
i'm not sure i'd want people who live in that kind of bubble to sit on a jury of my peers
in an earlier filing the defense took the trouble to analyze prospective jurors responses on the <unk>
it was the first court document i'd seen with pie charts in color
they were designed to show how bad things look for tsarnaev in boston's court of public opinion
the numbers were eye popping
sixty eight percents of the one thousand three hundred and seventy three people in the jury pool think tsarnaev is guilty
eighty five percents either think he's guilty or feel some personal connection to the bombing
the media coverage the defense said has spun a narrative of guilt
prosecutors responded that tsarnaev is notorious no matter where you go
in new york they said ninety two percents of the people surveyed in a telephone poll said they thought he was guilty
in washington d.c. eighty six percents
so far the argument of local bias hasn't moved judge <unk>
he keeps right on questioning folks convinced he can pull this off
all he needs is about seventy people who can agree to put aside their personal opinions and listen to the evidence
is it really possible to find twelve fair and impartial people in boston
can people really put aside everything they think they know about the marathon bombings as soon as they step into a courtroom
and then can those twelve people make a life or death decision on what the punishment should be in a state that hasn't had the death penalty for a generation
they've spent twelve days on jury selection nine of them questioning the prospects one by one
at the end of each day the lawyers and judge go behind closed doors to hash out who might make the cut
the boston globe filed court papers earlier this week seeking to open up the process
the <unk> lawyers argued that transparency would give the public more confidence in whatever the jury decides
but the judge thinks it also might give some of the prospects clues on how to dodge jury duty
so far <unk> has given no indication of how close they are to that magic number seventy
once they hit it we'll go into the lightning round where each side gets to eliminate twenty jurors
whoever is left standing is likely to make the jury
it is particularly disturbing to listen to so many people say it's up to the defense to convince them tsarnaev isn't guilty
save it for the <unk> court folks
you've been watching too many crime shows
you've got it bass <unk>
it's a cornerstone of our legal system that a person is presumed innocent until proven guilty
so the proper answer to any question about <unk> guilt at this stage is simple
he's innocent
nobody has proved anything yet
get it
it's not an opinion
it's a fact jack
it's perfectly ok to think tsarnaev did it as long as you don't use the g word
it's ok to believe he and his brother blew up the marathon and shot an mit campus cop to death while they were on the run
it's ok to think dzhokhar was the one the cops found hiding in a boat parked in somebody's backyard in <unk>
it's hard to argue with all the surveillance video
the footage of the brothers with the <unk> near the finish line the images of them in a gas station after a car <unk> the footage of police <unk> dzhokhar <unk> from the boat
but it's flat out wrong to say in front of a room full of people that <unk> is guilty
if you do you have no business being on his jury
that's probably just fine with most of these people
nobody in their right mind would volunteer to <unk> the horrific events of april fifteen two thousand and thirteen or want to decide whether another person should live or die
not for forty dollar a day
one woman said she worried others would judge her
people were saying only dumb people wind up on juries
you have to be smart enough to get out of jury duty
and it was even worse at the office
people at work think the job should be priority she said so shame on me for not getting out of jury duty and making my job my priority
another worried about who would care for her twenty one <unk>
she said it would be a nightmare to be the lone <unk> on a jury
but then there are those who know jury duty is a small price to pay to live in a democracy
i guess it's my turn to stand up said one
would i choose to do it
probably not but i know this is important said another
i felt a kick of dread in the pit of my stomach when the judge asked a man who has a small child if viewing images of dying or <unk> injured children would be disturbing to him
hell yes it would be
but he was one of those who feel duty bound to do the job
there were several people most of them middle aged women who seemed far too eager to be picked
perhaps they are bored with their routines and their afternoon <unk>
one who described herself as a country <unk> said she'd never been to something this big
it was all just so exciting
she walked in already convinced of <unk> guilt and said she'd have no problem giving him the death penalty
this happened on u.s. grounds and that's unacceptable she declared
not surprisingly she was one of the people waiting for the defense to come through and give us more facts to prove him innocent or at least worthy of more time on this earth
she said she feared tsarnaev might receive special privileges if he was sentenced to life in prison
asked why she thought that she replied i don't know
let's hope we don't see her again
a young stay at home mother acknowledged that she was anxious at first but now would welcome serving on the jury because it would get me out of the house
she seemed level headed in her responses so she might make the cut
she thought she could vote for the death penalty as a <unk>
the death penalty is the real elephant in the courtroom
many people from massachusetts just can't go there
some haven't given it much thought and really why would they in a state that hasn't had a death penalty on the books in a generation
the last time the state executed somebody was in one thousand nine hundred and forty seven
i've killed spiders and that's about it said one woman who like many others questioned said she won't really know where she stands until she's actually facing the reality of voting for someone's death
in theory she says i'd prefer not to have that option but i could go there
i heard two prospective jurors a man and a woman say they were shaking as they <unk> with the difficult questions about their ability to send another person to the death chamber
a young man with a purple <unk> who works part time at a tanning salon made no secret of his strong feelings and was quickly shown the door
i will not make that decision to put another human being to death he stated
i can't figure out whether boston has some of the <unk> people on the planet or some of the <unk>
if your goal is to get out of jury duty some of these folks have mad skills
consider the guy who wore a boston strong sweatshirt to the first day of jury selection
he hasn't been seen since
all my friends have said i'd be crazy not to make some crazy statement to get off this case said a woman who works in a bank
she played it sane
a middle aged man provided a peek at what was going on in the jury room
when i was in the first room and they were saying they were going to do anything they could to not be picked i was ashamed for them and ashamed of myself for feeling the same way he confessed
but he added somebody has to do this
nobody told him it would be <unk> hard
the outburst which came during murray's ill tempered four set six zero six three seven five win against berdych has been making the rounds
while exactly what <unk> said is up for debate the general consensus is that it was more than a little blue
the match was a tense one from the beginning with much of the pre game narrative focusing on murray's ex coach dani <unk> who is now in <unk> corner
the scot who is not above unleashing a <unk> of curse words on court downplayed his <unk> outburst after the victory
in the heat of the moment you can say stuff that you regret he said
when there's a lot of tension surrounding something which you created it's completely normal that the whole first set everyone was tight he told media following the match
even tomas who very rarely says anything on the court
there was tension there for him as well
he added that the tension came at the beginning of the match and settled down as it progressed
while some twitter commentators poured <unk> on the tennis star's significant other much of the social media reaction downplayed press coverage of <unk> outburst
murray's opponent dismissed talk of bad blood between him and the scot saying he was simply trying to pump himself up after winning the first set
i say to myself well done tomas
that's it berdych told reporters
i think i'm allowed to do that when i win a set
murray will play novak djokovic in the final on sunday
it will be the fourth time he has made the final in melbourne where he is yet to be crowned champion
so far people we talked to said it looked like it was an intentional act
so we're handling it as a homicide los angeles police lt. john <unk> said before the arrest
knight forty nine turned himself in to los angeles sheriff's department investigators early friday
he's being held in <unk> of about a two million dollar bond pending a court appearance which isn't expected until at least monday according to jane <unk> a spokeswoman for the los angeles county district attorney's office
cnn affiliate kcal tv and the los angeles times quoted knight's attorney james blatt as saying knight feared for his life and was trying to flee when the incident happened
we feel strongly mr. knight did not do anything wrong in this matter
he was attacked by a number of individuals that has already been corroborated by certain witnesses
he left the scene because he was in fear for his safety and life he said
in a conversation with cnn before the arrest blatt declined to confirm to cnn whether knight was driving
blatt hasn't returned multiple calls from cnn seeking comment since the arrest
the thursday incident allegedly began with an argument on the set of the biopic straight outta compton a film about the highly influential and controversial rap group <unk>
it then spilled over to the parking lot of <unk> burgers where authorities say knight tracked the men
it looks like he drove backward and struck the victims
and then went forward and struck them again as he left <unk> said
knight turned himself in early friday at the west hollywood sheriff's station accompanied by his attorney
after being questioned by detectives knight was booked and later transferred to the twin towers correctional facility in downtown los angeles according to jail records
the man who died has been identified as terry carter fifty five
the second man's name is <unk> sloan fifty one
he signed artists such as snoop <unk> dogg and tupac shakur raising the profile of west coast rap in the process
along with rapper producer and future entrepreneur andre dr. dre young he rode the wave of the fame from albums such as dr. <unk> the chronic in one thousand nine hundred and ninety two
in one thousand nine hundred and ninety three snoop <unk> debut album <unk> broke new ground in a genre of music previously dominated by east coast artists
knight's signing of controversial rapper tupac shakur in the mid nineties further increased the profiles of both knight and his company in the hip hop game
but with his imposing physique and reputation for not being averse to violence knight also found himself at the center of a feud between east coast and west coast rappers
the feud started as a war of words between rappers from each coast but things quickly escalated in one thousand nine hundred and ninety four after shakur accused producer sean <unk> combs and rapper christopher <unk> <unk> wallace of involvement in a one thousand nine hundred and ninety four shooting at a new york studio that left shakur injured
both combs who over the years has also been known as puff daddy <unk> and p. <unk> and wallace denied the accusations
the tensions intensified in one thousand nine hundred and ninety five after knight gave a speech at the source awards where he said any artist out there that want to be an artist and stay a star and don't have to worry about the executive producer trying to be all in the videos all on the record dancing
come to death row
many took the statement as a direct dig at combs who often appeared in his artists music videos
some have pointed to the feud as a contributing factor in the shooting deaths of both shakur in one thousand nine hundred and ninety six and wallace in one thousand nine hundred and ninety seven
both slayings remain <unk>
knight was driving the car in which shakur was a passenger when the rapper was shot to death in las vegas in one thousand nine hundred and ninety six
shortly afterward knight spent several years in prison for violating parole on assault and weapons convictions
that prison time along with <unk> death <unk> between knight and a number of rappers and <unk> by dr. dre snoop and others contributed to the <unk> bankruptcy in two thousand and six
in august knight and two others were shot while inside a celebrity filled sunset strip party hosted by singer chris brown on the eve of the mtv video music awards
in october he was busted along with comedian <unk> <unk> williams for allegedly stealing a photographer's camera

he told a reporter for the los angeles times that he'd never met smith
smith was an eighteen year veteran of twenty th century <unk> distribution department serving as a liaison between the studio and movie theaters according to the hollywood reporter
smith a former <unk> basketball player was last seen alive in may two thousand and twelve when he left a friend's house
after he went missing his family offered a twenty thousand dollar reward for information to help find him
it took nearly two and a half years before <unk> walking a dog stumbled upon his remains in a remote area north of los angeles
authorities have said they believe they know how and why smith was killed but they haven't revealed details
we have witnesses that are paramount to the case lt. dave <unk> of the los angeles county sheriff's department said last year
there was evidence in the car that indicated he was killed in the car
that the united states has negotiated in the past with groups and states that have <unk> and sponsored terror is beyond contention
but should it do so in the future
and equally important should it try to impose or try to influence others who are considering negotiating
these are tough questions so let's get the easy stuff out of the way first
there's no question that negotiating with terror groups paying ransoms <unk> these activities undermines america's credibility sets terrible <unk> and encourages <unk> and more terror
how could it not
nothing in life succeeds like success
and whether it's a legitimate business or criminal enterprise if something is working the tendency is to do more of it
as a consequence and given the stakes the official position of the u.s. government is that it does not negotiate with terrorist groups
the most obvious exception to the u.s. government's rule on negotiating was the reagan administration's efforts during the one thousand nine hundred and eighty s to seek the return of hostages held by lebanese shia groups famously revealed in the iran <unk> affair
and there was the green light given to israel to release hundreds of shia prisoners in one thousand nine hundred and eighty five in what amounted to a <unk> pro quo to win the freedom for u.s. citizens on hijacked <unk> flight eight hundred and forty seven
but there have been other more recent examples
these include facilitating the exchange of peter moore a british national kidnapped by shia <unk> in baghdad in two thousand and seven for <unk> al <unk> former spokesman for shia cleric <unk> al <unk> who was implicated in the killing of u.s. soldiers in <unk>
and then of course there was the bowe bergdahl exchange in two thousand and thirteen for five taliban officials a deal that the obama administration insists wasn't negotiating with terrorists in part because the taliban is an insurgent rather than a terrorist group
direct or indirect insurgent or terrorist these are for the most part <unk> that don't really amount to real differences
and if you push the argument too far they make the united states look inconsistent and <unk>
but these are in the past you might say
what about now particularly in the wake of the threat from isis and the beheading of american citizens
well the french government despite denials was reported by the new york times to have succeeded in buying back kidnapped nationals from isis
in addition four employees of a french nuclear firm were also freed after having been held by an al qaeda <unk> in northern niger reportedly in return for money although the french government denied this
that said the buying back of americans from isis may present even greater challenges especially when isis sets price tags like the one hundred and thirty two million dollar it demanded for james foley
still even given these enormous demands should the united states change its policy and try to secure the release of its citizens when they're in mortal <unk> particularly if escape or rescue aren't options
it is interesting that in response to isis hostage taking president obama ordered a review of u.s. policy on this issue
but if washington can't or won't change its policy should it look the other way if not facilitate the efforts of private individuals or family members who can raise funds to secure the release of family members
of course isis has raised tens of millions from hostage taking and nobody has a stake in adding to their coffers to enable them to take more hostages
but on the other hand do we just write these americans off as simply <unk> souls in the wrong place at the wrong time
after all if this was your son father husband wife daughter or sister would that be an acceptable response from your government
these matters raise serious moral and ethical questions that are <unk> painful to answer
at a minimum if other governments are faced with these kinds of situations as jordan and japan are now the united states shouldn't interfere or make it harder for them to decide as they choose
and i suspect that we are giving both <unk> to do so
but if the united states itself is faced with a situation in which there really is a chance to <unk> american nationals through negotiation it will pose <unk> tough choices
the war against this kind of terrorism is likely going to be a long and painful one
and we may well have to wrestle again with some very tough choices
do we maintain a <unk> position against negotiations discourage private citizens from their own efforts even threaten to prosecute them if they try to pay ransom
or do we approach each terror filled hostage taking <unk> and maintain some flexibility to see whether lives can be <unk> at an acceptable price
and who one might ask will determine what that price should be each time this situation arises
it's a position we may all have to confront
and there are no easy answers
obama issued a <unk> veiled swipe at the sudden interest a former presidential candidate has shown in poverty during his remarks at house democrats retreat in philadelphia thursday night
we've got a former presidential candidate on the other side who suddenly is just deeply concerned about poverty
that's great
let's go
come on let's do something about it obama said <unk>
i am glad that their rhetoric at least has shifted but let's make sure that the policies match up to the rhetoric he added

i was gon na say obama added with a smile noting the jets place as rivals of the patriots that's why he's so <unk>
the patriots have been accused of <unk> their footballs during the afc championship game prompting calls for them to be barred from playing in the super bowl this sunday
an nfl investigation did confirm eleven of the twelve footballs used during the first half of the game were under inflated but patriots coach bill belichick and quarterback tom brady have denied any involvement
obama has yet to weigh in formally on the scandal and white house press secretary josh earnest previously said the administration plans to stay out of it

tucked away in an apartment building on a quiet side street of hong kong's busy <unk> bay district this small hotel is a <unk> to the umbrella revolution
freelance translator stephen thompson rented the apartment in early december in the same week that police began clearing out the city's pro democracy protest sites
i literally got the keys and then the next day i went down to admiralty and the police were coming and i just grabbed as much as i could says thompson
posters artwork and memorabilia from all three main protest sites now <unk> every inch of the six hundred square foot <unk>
rows of construction helmets are mounted neatly on the wall gas masks hang like <unk> around a door frame newspaper <unk> <unk> the kitchen and a yellow umbrella serves a partial curtain shielding the living room from the sun
i had the idea at first of an exhibition thompson says and then when they gave me the tents i thought well i'll put the tents in here too
and the idea for occupy central hotel was born
for as little as <unk> dollar per night guests can pay via a listing on airbnb to sleep in an original occupy tent
the two bedroom apartment <unk> a total of eight thompson says but five is the most he's rented at once
each tent is <unk> with a name relating to the movement such as freedom house and foreign force <unk>
nicholas <unk> twenty six followed the hong kong protests from his hometown of manchester england and recently extended his visit at the hotel
i had a look online
there are cheaper places to stay but i thought this would just be more interesting
it's an experience worth having and it's a cause worth supporting says <unk>
visitors from ukraine france and mexico round out some of the hotel's other recent occupants
thompson says he has also hosted guests from mainland china but only after they sent him messages saying they opposed communist rule
originally from london thompson describes himself as a white skinned chinese dissident
a fluent mandarin speaker and writer he spent three decades in and out of china before the government threatened to <unk> his visa for writing politically critical articles
he has been living in hong kong for eight years now and hoping to gain permanent residency soon
i feel hong kong is a kind of bubble of freedom and human rights in china he says which is why he found the eleven week long pro democracy demonstrations so inspirational
victor <unk> twenty nine watched the occupy movement with interest from <unk>
he says the chinese university where he teaches french and history <unk> him to come to hong kong to see the protests in person which is why he is now staying at the hotel
it's always good to have people like stephen who keep the memory <unk> says
in china students don't know what happened in one thousand nine hundred and eighty nine because all the memories have been deleted
preserving the memory and keeping the democracy movement alive is something the fifty year old thompson says he is passionate about
however the hong kong home affairs department requires anyone running a <unk> to apply for a special permit from the office of the licensing authority something thompson says he doesn't need to do because he is selective about who he allows to stay
despite questions over the legality of his venture thompson says he hopes to eventually open up two more occupy themed hotels one for each of the main protest sites
until then pro democracy supporters can continue <unk> the protests in a tiny <unk> bay apartment having their own movement against hong kong's chief executive <unk> <unk> one flush at a time

a trip to super bowl xlix in phoenix will cost even the most <unk> fans thousands of dollars while providing a hefty <unk> for business owners riding one of the biggest consumer spending weekends of the year in the u.s
victoria's secret models hosting twenty five thousand dollar tables <unk> ticket deals and risky online trading for super bowl seats have become as much a part of the annual celebration of america's favorite sport as the <unk> opening coin toss
with so much at stake many fans won't be leaving anything to chance in the race to book luxury hotels <unk> and some of the year's most lavish parties not to mention tickets to the big game itself
as a result a throwback solution from pre internet days has emerged as a winner
the hospitality package deal
it's a value add situation says <unk> <unk> owner of chicago based sports traveler who sold out of her few remaining super bowl packages last friday
hotels are just not available she says explaining that there is extra demand for four and five star accommodation over the weekend because of the phoenix open a four day pga tournament featuring tiger woods which concludes on super bowl sunday
for sports traveler clients drinking can start as early as at eleven point three zero a.m. on game day with a touchdown club <unk> party that includes an open bar and buffet that lasts until kickoff at three point three zero p.m
understandably a premium is placed on hassle free transportation from the resorts of <unk> to the university of phoenix stadium a forty minute drive away
people want to have some fun
they don't want to be the designated driver she explains
they just want the whole thing taken care of and guaranteed
yes you can do it yourself but a lot of people choose not to
working her fifteen th super bowl since starting her company as a student at saint <unk> university in chicago <unk> reserves blocks of hotel rooms in super bowl cities twelve months in advance
she has already launched her search for rooms in san francisco in preparation for super bowl fifty to be played in nearby santa <unk>
providing that scarce availability along with a game ticket provides an advantage over hotel booking sites she says
at this late stage the basic package deals left on <unk> site <unk> dot com begin at six thousand dollar for one upper level end zone super bowl ticket four nights at a three star hotel game day <unk> and pre game festivities
the quote is per person based on a double <unk> room
singles start at seven thousand dollar and <unk> is not included
the <unk> super bowl get in price on ticket <unk> <unk> at the time of writing stands at three thousand five hundred and seven dollar valuing the add <unk> and convenience of a package deal at two thousand four hundred and ninety three dollar per person
seventy percent of sports <unk> clients are <unk> many of whom have asked for golf <unk> times and pga tickets to be <unk> onto their deals
the remaining batch encompasses bucket <unk> looking to attend any super bowl international fans and of course <unk> seattle seahawks and new england patriots supporters who waited to see whether their teams would qualify
then there are the <unk>
lots of them
the concept of staging <unk> party themed events leading up to the super bowl began over ten years ago and has taken on a new realm of competition
each year the likes of rolling stone <unk> and playboy try and <unk> each other to attract the most famous bands models and personalities to their parties granting access at eye watering prices
the saturday night before the super bowl is really when everyone wants to go out says <unk> adding that the playboy party is often at the top of her corporate clients demand list
it's a guy based event absolutely she says about the bash which <unk> twenty four playboy <unk> mingling with guests while the rapper <unk> plays master of ceremonies
all tickets include an open bar and buffet
but what else could make the eight hundred and fifty dollar entrance fee worthwhile
you can use your imagination she says
there are lots of girls in there and lots of drinking
it's an experience
every superstar player that's not appearing in the super bowl will make a paid appearance at one or two of those events prior to the game says ahmad <unk> who organized the new york giants super bowl victory party in phoenix in two thousand and eight
imagine a nightclub two nights before the super bowl with nothing but <unk> young athletes competing on what they spend he adds
it's just champagne and <unk> everywhere
this year's hot ticket is the rolling stone magazine party with performances by steven tyler of <unk> and <unk> <unk>
tickets start at one thousand and forty five dollar and hit fifty six thousand two hundred and thirty eight dollar for a platinum center table on <unk> dot com
the victoria's secret hosted leather and <unk> party starts at four hundred and ninety five dollar for a lounge seat climbs to two thousand five hundred dollar for a meet and greet with the likes of <unk> lima and <unk> <unk> and hits twenty five thousand dollar for a celebrity <unk>
although <unk> stresses that <unk> attended by a <unk> are closed to the paying public some parties advertised as invite only are anything but
general admission tickets to <unk> super saturday night invite only bash featuring a performance from <unk> are offered on <unk> dot com for nine hundred and seventy dollar
while arranging tickets to parties is usually a straightforward process for agencies <unk> super bowl tickets is another issue entirely
<unk> says she sources some tickets via corporate sponsors but declines to reveal exactly how she fulfills the remainder of her <unk> obligations
<unk> ties with those who have access along with playing the secondary ticket market are two methods according to will flaherty at <unk>
a lot of the teams cut deals with ticket brokers and sell their tickets in advance he says pointing to a controversy last year when the denver broncos and seahawks both sold super bowl tickets to prime sport
it's not something that teams want people to know that they are doing particularly teams that have qualified
in addition flaherty says many agents work the secondary ticket market <unk> like stock traders
without holding inventory they will enter agreements to sell tickets in the two weeks leading up to the playoff semifinals
once the super bowl opponents are determined prices normally fall by over one thousand dollar in the two weeks leading up to game day flaherty says
the drop allows agents to cover their end of the deal by purchasing cheaper tickets closer to game time at a healthy margin
the trend has been consistent over the last four years according to data provided by <unk> which places a value score on tickets available across the web
during this year's run up however market forces have worked the other way pushing the average sold ticket price up forty percents from a week earlier to four thousand one hundred and twenty six dollar potentially leaving risk takers in turmoil only days before the super bowl
the <unk> brokers however <unk> market speculation for less scrupulous means
it's not uncommon to hear stories of agents with <unk> full of cash flying down to phoenix to buy super bowl tickets in hotel <unk> off of players says flaherty noting that every nfl player and coach is allotted two super bowl tickets to purchase at face value
<unk> the tickets for profit is against nfl rules a violation for which former minnesota <unk> head coach mike <unk> was fined one hundred thousand dollar in two thousand and five
flaherty advises fans to wait until a few days before super bowl sunday to make their purchases when last minute deals can often be <unk>
<unk> suggests the same to party goers
once you get there and your boots are on the ground you can negotiate better deals for sure he says
for some fans competing for the best deals off the field is part of the fun
most however would prefer to <unk> in what phoenix has to offer and leave the <unk> to the professionals

the tennis obsessed <unk> would play for hours on end against a wall or a water tank at the time thinking the tournament was merely the stuff of fairy tales
i read this princess magazine story recalls the sixty three year old seven time grand slam singles winner in an interview with cnn open court at the australian open
one story was about this girl who trained and was taken to this place called wimbledon where she won on this magical court
i didn't know it was for real but she said yes this place exists in england
from that moment <unk> the wall or water tank was the net at the all england club the concrete under her feet the <unk> grass turf <unk> by so many past champions
every time i went to sleep at night i would dream about playing at that magical center court and every time i hit the wall i would pretend i was there
nicknamed the sunshine super girl early in her career goolagong cawley achieved exactly that feat in one thousand nine hundred and seventy one winning the first of grand slam titles
she is twelve th on the list of all time singles grand slam winners level with venus williams and ended her career with nineteen single titles in all
as well as two wimbledon titles goolagong cawley also won the australian open four times the french open three fed cup titles and reached world number one in one thousand nine hundred and seventy six
if the fairy tale came true there were also many times when the clock struck midnight with her story marked by episodes where as with so many <unk> she was often treated as a second class citizen
there was a regular fear of being taken away from her parents
many australians thought the best practice was for <unk> children to be removed from their families to be given a life away from poverty and an education in white australian society
whenever a car would come down the road my mum would tell us to hide or else the welfare man would take you away she recalls
even as an adult she was <unk> aware of how <unk> could be excluded from everyday life even after winning wimbledon
before i started traveling overseas and i was with a friend and in those days i loved music and i loved disco dancing so she took me out but i wasn't allowed in
that happened again in brisbane and i was with two <unk> friends and this was just after i won wimbledon
i said don't worry we'll go somewhere else
i think it hurt my friends more than me
the goolagong family were the only <unk> in the small town of <unk> in new south wales
her father kenny was a hard working sheep <unk> who gained <unk> for being able to <unk> one hundred animals in a day
the tennis star was the third of kenny and <unk> eight children
in her town goolagong cawley became renowned for her tennis and was first invited to play on a court when a neighbor bill <unk> caught her <unk> through the fence
following encouragement from locals tennis coach <unk> edwards traveled up from sydney to see the then ten year old play
he persuaded her parents to let him bring her to the metropolis enrolled her in school <unk> her and for a time had her live with him
she arrived in the big city with her first tennis dress made for her by her mother from sheets and with equipment paid for by the people of her home town
there was no pressure on her to play the sport by her parents and her mother would never ask on her return after a match if she had won merely if she had had fun
sydney was to provide no <unk> from the racism goolagong cawley had to face
she especially remembers an incident while playing with edwards daughter against two older ladies
one of the older ladies didn't like the idea of two youngsters beating up on them
we won pretty easily
when it was time to shake hands
and she said
this is the first time i've had the pleasure of playing a <unk> and i've never heard that before and i started to get really upset
as her mentor edwards did his best to shield her from such prejudice
he taught me not to believe in what you read believe in yourself so i never read anything
i realize now he was blocking me from a lot of things
i always just thought of myself as a tennis player
i was protected from a lot of publicity and politics of life
but her tennis success helped goolagong cawley break down barriers becoming the first non white to play in apartheid south africa in a tournament in one thousand nine hundred and seventy two
even today she is helping indigenous people in australia with the foundation she has set up with her husband the former british tennis player roger cawley
her motto for it as it was during her playing days is dream believe learn achieve
the program encourages the children to play tennis but also to stay in school as they do so
the reason why i'm doing this is because i wouldn't be here unless i had the initial support of the <unk> of <unk>
that's why i am doing what i am doing today trying to help young indigenous kids find their dream
by the time she arrived as a player at her dream location of wimbledon the then eighteen year old also known as la <unk> <unk> was already well known to the british press
she was put on the show courts unheard of back then for an <unk> young player
i didn't realize they were writing about me before i got there she recalls
they didn't normally put a young person first time at wimbledon on center court but they did with me
it really scared the hell out of me and i wanted to get off the court as quickly as possible and i did
on her return the following year in one thousand nine hundred and seventy one she beat the great margaret court and fellow australian in the final although <unk> insists that was only because her opponent was pregnant and not moving to the best of her ability
however goolagong cawley repeated the feat on the same <unk> turf in one thousand nine hundred and eighty with a three year old daughter in <unk>
in so doing she was the first mother to be crowned wimbledon champion since before the outset of world war i
super girl had become super mum
but for all the <unk> titles and accolades having fun was the key motivation
i believe that's what life is all about
i certainly had a lot of fun during my career playing tennis doing the thing i wanted to do and to do it well
several democrats have told cnn that there is a desire on the part of clinton and her <unk> circle to go as late as possible
but the potential for a summer start to the official clinton two thousand and sixteen campaign first reported this morning by politico is only one of the options on the table
the spring launch plan is still seen by most clinton watchers as the most likely timing scenario
under the spring scenario clinton could form an exploratory committee or other official vehicle which has fec regulated restrictions for potential candidates but would enable clinton to publicly indicate her intentions and begin a new phase of the process without formally launching a full blown campaign until later in two thousand and fifteen
there is some concern among clinton loyalists that as the increasingly crowded republican race heats up the attacks on clinton could begin to stick without an apparatus in place to answer them
mitt romney the two thousand and twelve republican nominee who is pondering another run invoked clinton numerous times during recent speeches
the liberal <unk> american bridge has been countering republican attacks on clinton's behalf but the cover has not necessarily been to the satisfaction of all in clinton's orbit
the democratic national committee is beginning to take on a larger role in an effort to protect clinton and the party brand but many democrats are concerned even that won't be enough
some democrats have also expressed concern that a later start to clinton's campaign will appear like the nomination is shaping up to be more of a <unk> and a race something clinton and her advisers are looking to avoid
however those pushing for a later start argue that the more hillary clinton can stay out of the daily to and <unk> of presidential politics the better that is for hillary clinton
no top democrats have made serious moves to challenging clinton's informal and all but certain campaign
in addition with the uptick of obama's approval ratings and easing of economic pessimism among the voters some supporters of a later start argue that clinton might want to continue to benefit from those environmental conditions before jumping into the daily presidential campaign mix
last fall an internal debate emerged about whether a campaign should form in january or february of two thousand and fifteen or if it would be better to wait for spring
those arguing for a spring start won that debate at the time but it clearly did not stand as the final word on the matter
according to newly published stats the gigantic <unk> of humanity that is the japanese <unk> of tokyo is now the safest major urban destination on the planet
the safe cities index two thousand and fifteen compiled by the economist ranks tokyo at the top in terms of digital security health security infrastructure and personal safety

the protesters <unk> stones at the convoy as it left the palace of a traditional chief in <unk> the capital of the northeastern state of <unk> where jonathan had gone on a courtesy call before holding a rally as part of his re election campaign
nigerians will vote for their next president february fourteen
several vehicles were damaged in the attack according to witnesses
as soon the convoy left the palace of the emir of <unk> the crowd threw stones and broke the <unk> of several vehicles and <unk> others said <unk> resident clement moses
the crowd made up mostly of young men was angry at the heavy military and police presence deployed for the presidential visit
armed soldiers and policemen <unk> the city and forced businesses to close
people were angry with the huge military deployment for the president while boko haram continue to run over towns and villages in neighboring borno adamawa and yobe states said <unk> <unk> another resident
they kept shouting that soldiers should deploy to <unk> forest in borno state and fight boko haram instead of coming to the city and <unk> the people already traumatized by boko haram <unk> said
policemen fired tear gas to disperse the crowds
there were no immediate reports of injuries or arrests
jonathan has come under heavy criticism at home and abroad over his response to boko haram
the group has terrorized northern nigeria regularly since two thousand and nine attacking police schools churches and civilians and bombing government buildings
the islamist group has said its aim is to impose a stricter form of sharia law across nigeria which is split between a majority muslim north and a mostly christian south
it has sacked dozens of villages close to the border with cameroon this month slaughtering residents and abducting others
thursday was not the first time the president's convoy was attacked
on january twenty his motorcade was <unk> in the northern city of <unk> where he was campaigning
jonathan faces a formidable challenge from a opposition alliance
the development has led to an ongoing debate inside the administration about whether there is a new threat from this man and potentially the other four
this is the first known suggestion that any of the detainees involved in the exchange may be trying to engage again in militant activity
it comes at a politically sensitive time as the administration has <unk> the pace of prisoner release in an effort to encourage the closure of the guantanamo and the army must decide in the coming weeks whether and how to punish bergdahl for leaving his post
who were the detainees swapped for bergdahl
several u.s. officials across different agencies and branches of the u.s. government have confirmed key details to cnn
the white house referred cnn to the pentagon
the officials would not say which of the five men is suspected
but an ongoing u.s. intelligence program to secretly intercept and monitor all of their communications in qatar turned up evidence in recent months that one of them has reached out to try to encourage militant activity one official said
the official would offer no further details
what i can say with confidence is this individual has not returned to the battlefield this individual is not allowed to travel outside qatar and this individual has not engaged in any physical violence white house spokesman josh earnest said friday
under current law this act placed the man in the category of being suspected of re engaging in terrorist or insurgent activities
however several officials say there is now a debate inside the administration that the intelligence may be stronger than the suspected classification
some elements of the intelligence community believe the information is strong enough to classify the man as confirmed for returning to illegal activities
all five men are having their communications even more closely monitored right now but the belief is there is no current threat one official told cnn
publicly administration officials are emphasizing that the activity in question was revealed through monitoring mechanisms the u.s. and qatar put into effect for the very purpose of preventing <unk>
the fact that our mitigation measures helped alert us to potential concerns about one of these individuals means that our mitigation measures are working and have allowed us to make appropriate adjustments in a timely manner to properly mitigate any potential threats
state department spokeswoman jen psaki said in a briefing friday
pentagon press secretary rear admiral john kirby tells cnn that in addition to its discussions with the qatari government the united states is working across its various law enforcement and intelligence agencies to address the issue
we have a strong security partnership with qatar and are in constant dialogue with qatari government officials about these five detainees and we are confident that we would be able to mitigate any threat of re engagement by any of these members kirby said in an interview that will air thursday night on cnn's erin burnett out front
under intelligence laws the definition of confirmed for returning to militant activity is that there is a <unk> of information which identifies a specific former gitmo detainee as directly involved in terrorist or insurgent activities
the definition of suspected is that there is plausible but unverified or single source reporting indicating a specific former gitmo detainee is directly involved in terrorist or insurgent activities
congress has been notified of the information but it has not been made public
the precise terms of their release to qatar and the <unk> promise to monitor their activities has never been made public
all five are believed to still be in that country u.s. officials said
the five who mostly held mid to high level positions within the taliban before their capture during the early days of the u.s. led war in afghanistan were detained because of their association with the taliban not because of any ties to al qaeda
one of the men was alleged to have been directly associated with osama bin laden while another commanded the main force fighting the u.s. backed northern alliance in two thousand and one
another of the men was a senior official in the taliban intelligence service while another served as head of the taliban's communications effort and also helped al qaeda members escape into pakistan
the release of the five taliban has been highly controversial and politically sensitive for the obama administration
defense secretary chuck hagel had to agree to the release but his own staff has long noted his doubts
president barack obama maintained he received assurances from the qatari government about the five detainees before their release but noted the difficult road ahead
i wouldn't be doing it if i thought that it was contrary to american national security obama said at a news conference in poland a few days after the transfer
and we have confidence that we will be in a position to go after them if in fact they are engaging in activities that threaten our defenses he said
kirby said hagel was well aware of the potential danger the five men posed
he believes that the risk has been substantially mitigated through the assurances that we received through the emir of qatar kirby said at the time of the release
i would remind you that these are assurances that the emir personally gave to the president of the united states

linda <unk> <unk> a volunteer archaeologist on the project recently presented what she and other researchers from the north carolina department of cultural resources discovered about the equipment at the society for historical <unk> annual meeting
among the more cringe inducing findings were a <unk> <unk> used to inject mercury for the treatment of <unk> and a <unk> pump used to deliver medical <unk> for quicker absorption
we just have to understand that these people were suffering <unk> <unk> said
they were seeking relief for any kind of ailment and certainly if there was warfare on the water there were wounds among other ailments that needed treatment
it wasn't always a formally trained person in desperate times
that's probably more common than we know
she added that this time period was still the era of mystical medical treatments and that outward symptoms were often treated rather than the underlying causes

dr. james d. <unk> is a pediatrician at the children's hospital at dartmouth <unk> in lebanon new hampshire and is the scott m. and lisa g. stuart professor of pediatric oncology at geisel school of medicine at dartmouth college
<unk> is the recipient of the two thousand and eleven c. <unk> <unk> md courage award from the geisel school of medicine at dartmouth and the two thousand and nine special achievement award from the american academy of pediatrics for his work studying the effects of lead exposure in infants and children and the influence of media exposure on cigarette smoking on children and youth
the opinions expressed in this commentary are his
should parents worry about children seeing the pac man ad
if you want my professional opinion yes
parents should approach ads for alcoholic beverages with great caution
in a new study published in jama pediatrics my colleagues at dartmouth and i showed that youths involvement with alcohol marketing influenced their drinking behaviors
we asked about alcohol use in more than two thousand u.s. teens ages fifteen twenty
for the survey we collected more than three hundred alcohol advertisements that aired on american television during the prior year
from each of these ads a still photo was captured
these stills went into a pool of images from which twenty were randomly drawn for each survey
we wanted to know whether children when presented these images would say they had seen them or liked them
we also <unk> any indication of brand and asked them if they could tell which brand of alcohol was being advertised
based on the responses we created a score that measured how familiar they were with alcohol advertising
we wanted to know if that score would predict whether or not they <unk> from never drinking to trying alcohol or from trying alcohol to trying binge drinking
binge drinking was defined as consuming six or more alcoholic drinks at any one time
to make sure that any effect seen was due to the content of the alcohol ads we also captured fast food ads created stills from these ads and put together a score for familiarity with fast food television advertising
we also asked how many of their friends drink alcohol how much their parents drink alcohol and how much the kids like to take risks
we then <unk> the children one to two years later
a lot of them made drinking <unk>
for example about a third who at the beginning of the study had never tried binge drinking had begun to binge drink by the follow up survey
we wanted to know which characteristics at the first survey predicted starting to binge drink at the second
the key risk factors were drinking by friends risk taking and familiarity with television alcohol advertising
all else being equal kids who scored highest on familiarity with alcohol ads were more than four times more likely to take up binge drinking compared with low scoring ones
in contrast familiarity with fast food tv advertising did not predict binge drinking nor did parent drinking
in a previous paper involving these youths we showed that familiarity with fast food marketing was linked to more eating at fast food restaurants and higher risk for obesity
unfortunately u.s. youth in this age range commonly start binge drinking and often report problems because of their drinking
the problems range from fighting and sexual encounters they regret to injuries and deaths youths sustain when they drive drunk
pediatricians see these problems in our clinics and emergency rooms
that's why we want to find out whether there are risk factors for binge drinking that could be modified to reduce the problem
alcohol marketing seems to be a key <unk> risk factor
this study raises serious questions about whether alcohol companies should be able to advertise on television at all much less on a program that reaches as many children as the super bowl
in one thousand nine hundred and seventy the u.s congress passed the public health cigarette smoking act which banned cigarette companies from advertising on television
perhaps it's time for us to ask why alcohol companies are still allowed to place their ads there when studies show they may affect underage drinking
for sunday the super bowl offers parents a chance to explain that alcohol advertising aims to associate the brand with humor friendship romance and <unk> with the goal of getting you to want to buy that brand and drink it
the hope is that by promoting a discussion parents will teach healthy skepticism about the intent of companies and reduce the influence of their ads
now would you two care for a date
that was possible some fifty five thousand years ago in modern day israel archaeologists announced this week a find that they say could be significant since it could shed light on when and how our modern day ancestors moved from africa into europe and asia
it's all based on the discovery of portions of a skull in manot cave in western <unk> detailed in a study published wednesday in nature
the specimen is unequivocally modern and is similar in shape to recent african skulls as well as to european skulls according to the report from a team of researchers from the university of tel aviv ben <unk> university israel antiquities authority and elsewhere
it's amazing co author israel <unk> told the guardian explaining how the skull was found on the rocky shelf of a cave that collapsed thirty thousand years ago and was revealed in two thousand and eight
this is the first specimen we have that connects africa to europe
why is that time frame significant
for one thing many scientists believe modern humans left africa for points north forty thousand to sixty thousand years ago
the nature study suggests it was closer to the older date and that they might have gone through the modern day middle east
according to the report an analysis of the skull indicates that the manot people could be closely related to the first modern humans who later successfully <unk> europe
in other words the first modern day europeans thought to have arrived on that continent around forty five thousand years ago may have stopped in israel first
but it's not like they were all alone then among hominids the blanket term for <unk> primates from chimpanzees to homo <unk> in either place
around that time what's known as the upper paleolithic period or late stone age there were neanderthals both in europe and in what's now israel
the nature study claims the manot find represents the only modern human specimen to provide evidence that during the middle and upper paleolithic interface both modern humans and neanderthals <unk> inhabited the southern levant
this all was happening around the time of likely interbreeding
with the neanderthals meaning the two groups of hominids could have gotten together and reproduced
without dna tests it's impossible to say if the adult whose skull was found was a pure <unk> of the modern humans who came from africa or had a bit of <unk> <unk> mixed in
but it definitely could have happened
or just as possible that person or some immediate ancestors could have reproduced with neanderthals
manot is the best candidate for the interbreeding of modern humans with neanderthals <unk> told the guardian
there really is no other candidate
the discovery was generally greeted warmly by experts though with some hints of caution
this was only one specimen after all so there may be others out there that could be even more informative
and it was only part of a skull
chris stringer of london's natural history museum tweeted that he agrees with skeptics that interbreeding could have happened elsewhere in asia
also skull lacks the most informative areas
yet in comments to discovery news stringer also acknowledged that manot might represent some of the elusive first migrants in the <unk> out of africa event about sixty thousand years ago a population whose descendants ultimately spread right across asia and also into europe
stringer said it is the first modern human from western asia that is well dated to the estimated time frame of interbreeding between early modern humans and neanderthals

at least thirty six people were wounded in the assaults which involved car bombs and mortar rounds in the town of al arish in north sinai the sources told the egyptian website
the army is battling an islamist insurgency in north sinai that has spiked since the two thousand and thirteen ouster of islamist president mohamed morsy
suspected militants carried out consecutive attacks on the headquarters of the north sinai security <unk> in al arish a nearby army base a hotel and several security checkpoints state tv and the ahram arabic news website reported
blasts cracked walls and shattered windows of surrounding buildings
troops <unk> the area in search of suspects
the country's most active jihadist group ansar <unk> al <unk> said via twitter that it was behind the assaults
in november the sinai based group pledged allegiance to isis which has seized swaths of syria and iraq
the office of flagship newspaper ahram in al arish located near the targeted police building was slightly damaged in the attack office head ahmed <unk> said
the building was vacant at the time because of a dusk to dawn curfew imposed in north sinai late in october after deadly militant attacks that killed thirty one soldiers earlier in the month in what was considered the worst violence on egyptian troops in recent times
one army member was killed and another wounded in a separate attack on a security checkpoint in the north sinai border town of <unk>
the military said the violence came in response to the successful security campaign against militants in the restive province
the statement did not include a death or injury toll
egypt's army has struggled to crush the militant insurgency in the peninsula which at times has expanded to mainland cities including cairo
militants have mainly targeted police and troops killing hundreds in the last eighteen months
ansar <unk> al <unk> has claimed responsibility for some of the deadliest attacks
the violence has prompted the army to <unk> houses and clear residents in <unk> in an attempt to establish to a buffer zone aimed at <unk> militant infiltration and arms smuggling
still after a high profile missile strike by israel days of missile attacks by the lebanese militant group and exchanges of fire tensions are high
the possibility remains that a full scale military confrontation could <unk> as it did in two thousand and six
while regional politics are at play numerous other major factors are as well including oil prices isis iran's nuclear dispute with the west and the threat of hezbollah terrorist attacks around the world
this week hezbollah fired five anti tank missiles at israeli military vehicles near the lebanese border killing two soldiers and wounding seven others
israel also evacuated a town that includes a popular ski resort following hezbollah attacks in the region
in <unk> that followed a spanish service member with the u.n. peacekeeping force in lebanon was killed
it's unclear whether he was killed by hezbollah or israeli fire the united nations said
spain's u.n
ambassador roman <unk> <unk> said the violence resulted from the rocket attacks launched by hezbollah and the artillery fire which followed
when asked whose fire killed the peacekeeper <unk> said it was because of the escalation of violence and it came from the israeli side
but the next day stephane <unk> spokesman for u.n. secretary general ban ki moon said the precise cause of death is as yet <unk> and remains the subject of investigation
all this follows an israeli airstrike last week in the syrian town of quneitra that killed six hezbollah operatives and at least one member of iran's revolutionary guard
iran state media said gen. mohammad ali <unk> was killed but the jerusalem post reported that six iranian commanders were killed
the attack delivered perhaps the highest profile blow to hezbollah and iranian interests in syria since the outbreak of war there <unk> <unk> wrote on <unk> dot com
among those killed was jihad mughniyeh
in his twenty s he was the son of one of hezbollah's founders <unk> mughniyeh who was killed in a two thousand and eight bombing in damascus syria
jihad <unk> death represented a symbolic blow to the <unk> islamist group that his father helped to found with iranian backing in the early one thousand nine hundred and eighty s the jerusalem post reported
although hezbollah is based in lebanon it is aligned with and supports the regime of syrian president bashar al assad
iran supports both the syrian regime and hezbollah as well
the fighting has been taking place in the region in which lebanon and syria border the israeli controlled golan heights
the israeli tank that was struck was in shebaa farms also known as <unk> <unk> a disputed strip of land
neither israel nor hezbollah wants the situation to spiral into a war analysts say
i think israel's trying to defend its borders and is concerned about attacks from a well known terrorist group across the border said matthew levitt author of the two thousand and thirteen book hezbollah
the global footprint of <unk> party of god
in hezbollah there are elements that would like to escalate said levitt director of the counterterrorism program at the washington institute for near east policy
but the attack against the israeli patrol really does appear calculated to minimize response
you don't have a force going into israel proper you don't have the attempts to <unk> bodies he said
in two thousand and six war broke out after hezbollah militants crossed into israel killing three soldiers and kidnapping two others then killed another five israeli soldiers
hezbollah has many of its fighters at war in syria on behalf of al assad
but the group has others available to carry out attacks against israel
and it felt it had to respond to last week's israeli airstrike on quneitra sending a message to its community and its constituency said levitt
iran felt the same way
tehran viewed the quneitra attack as crossing a line that warrants a response said <unk> <unk> president of the national iranian american council and author of a single roll of the dice
obama's diplomacy with iran
all this is taking place against a backdrop of negotiations between iran and western powers over its nuclear activities
the israel hezbollah dispute comes at a pivotal time for the nuclear talks in a way that is not helpful for the u.s. or iran <unk> said
depending on how the nuclear talks go iran may show restraint or the situation may escalate further he said
iran needs to make sure the situation <unk> down said michael rubin a former pentagon official now at the american enterprise institute
iran can't afford to let the fighting between hezbollah and israel get out of hand as it did in two thousand and six he said
more than one thousand people on the lebanese side and more than one hundred and fifty on the israeli side died in the war
most scenarios involving an israeli strike on iran's nuclear program involve a simultaneous push into lebanon to blunt hezbollah's ability to retaliate and fire missiles into israel
if israel and hezbollah's <unk> <unk> into war and hezbollah rocket fire then the israelis might figure in for a penny in for a pound in other words fighting back against hezbollah might mean going after iran's nuclear sites
if things escalate to the point where hezbollah starts firing missiles at israeli cities then israel might figure that's as good a green light as any to get the job done rubin said
the israel hezbollah dynamic also has implications for the fight against the isis terror network
the united states and iran both oppose isis
u.s. officials have opened channels of communication with iran over it
the fighting between hezbollah a shiite militant group and israel should highlight the dangers of relying on iran against sunni extremists like isis
rather than bring stability or security hezbollah's actions show that the u.s. would simply be swapping one flavor of extremism for another rubin said
another piece of the puzzle is the oil market
the drop in oil prices is hurting iran hezbollah's sponsor
the iranians spent a lot of money helping hezbollah repair lebanon in the wake of the two thousand and six war
price of oil going down stretched in syria iran is simply not flush and i don't think wants it this time around former u.s. state department official aaron david miller now with the wilson center told cnn's wolf blitzer
iran is also struggling from sanctions over its nuclear activities and is <unk> billions of dollars to the syrian regime the christian science monitor reports
hezbollah has had to tighten its belt
but there's another way hezbollah can <unk> its muscle
through further terrorist attacks elsewhere in the world said levitt
the group has a long history of attacks overseas including one at the u.s. marine barracks in beirut lebanon in one thousand nine hundred and eighty three that killed two hundred and forty one americans
bulgaria found hezbollah was behind an attack on a bus that killed five israeli tourists in two thousand and twelve
peru reported <unk> a bomb attempt late last year
authorities announced they would press charges against a man who confessed to being a member of hezbollah reuters reported
ever since the militant group's military chief <unk> mughniyeh was killed in the two thousand and eight bombing hezbollah has been trying to carry out new terrorist attacks around the world in response levitt said
they are a few of the public objects that have been yarn bombed in recent months as a movement known locally as <unk> <unk> has inspired imaginations across the south american nation
a far cry from the marble sculptures displayed in the nearby museum the trend that began in texas in two thousand and five has seen a growing number of open spaces transformed with <unk> creations reminiscent of giant tea <unk>
the interventions may be little more than a <unk> fad to some but to <unk> <unk> <unk> who founded the yarn bombing collective <unk> in <unk> a coastal town in northern chile it's a social project with far reaching goals
<unk> <unk> who earns a living as a fashion designer says she's trying to <unk> outdated assumptions while drawing people into playing a more active role in their community
when i founded the group the goal was to smash stereotypes she says
<unk> is no longer just for <unk>
it's for women men and children
we go to public places and we give a meaning to them through the designs and the colors
we don't knit boring patterns in bland colors
we yarn bomb in green red purple
the idea isn't just to cover objects
it's to <unk> them as well
so far the group has yarn bombed a fishing boat the control towers of two industrial <unk> several bicycles and a large stretch of railing
what inspired all this <unk>
we wanted to develop the <unk> identity and differentiate ourselves from other yarn bombing groups which tend to focus mainly on covering trees she explained
as <unk> is based in a port area we wanted to focus on what <unk> the zone like the sea and the port infrastructure
at the same time we wanted to help make the work of the local fishermen here more visible
the structures that proved most difficult were the control towers on the <unk> ninety eight foot industrial <unk>
since they were located on a private site there were a number of health and safety rules to observe
initially the port workers didn't understand what we wanted to do but after a few days they got it and we were working as a team
a few months ago her team spent three months <unk> a huge covering for a pedestrian railing along the <unk> using three hundred and twenty five dollar worth of <unk> wool
that's a great deal of money in a town where the average monthly income is less than nine hundred and seventy two dollar but <unk> <unk> sees it as more than a way of passing her spare time
for me it's an enjoyable and <unk> collective form of work
it's helped facilitate networks of friendship
a few hundred miles south in <unk> <unk> a neighborhood historically inhabited by italian immigrants in santiago a man's mountain bike <unk> is being <unk> with a <unk> of red and orange yarn
on plastic chairs a few feet away sit members of <unk> a yarn bombing collective that has made more than thirty interventions since its founding two years ago
today the group is yarn bombing bicycle <unk> but next month they hope to invade several music festivals with their colorful <unk>
after that says group member mara jos de santiago they hope to cover iconic monuments and take over the <unk>
the group's initial aim was to add color to santiago which they see as overwhelmingly gray
it's also become a way to make the public think about the way they relate to the spaces around them
normally cities have an identity that is cold and distant
there can be a sense that you are there but you don't belong there de santiago said
we wanted to change all that so people feel more connected and as if they belong
yarn bombing is urban art it's an expression of the people and we want to cause a <unk> revolution by taking this tradition and bringing it into the twenty one st century
it's a bold ambition that has come with challenges
displayed in open air often in crowded places the interventions can be used or abused by <unk> at will
both groups have seen their work torn off sometimes minutes after being put up
on one occasion a local took a lighter to the wool and set it on fire
but for the most part the interventions last several weeks and sometimes much longer
the temporary nature of the art is particularly relevant for <unk> <unk> lee who combines yarn bombing interventions with charity work through the club <unk> <unk> chile
the thirty one year old engineer covers palm trees and park benches during the day before donating the creations to <unk> and homes for the elderly in the evening
i think of yarn bombing as a form of self expression a way to give color and warmth to the city and to change the surroundings she told cnn
i want to provoke a reaction from people to see something different while they are going about their day
but in a country famous for <unk> respect for the law yarn bombers risk brushes with the local <unk>
without a permit to place yarn over public objects they can be fined
and in chile even a minor criminal record can have catastrophic consequences for an <unk> career prospects
we had a permit to yarn bomb <unk> <unk> a while back de santiago recalls referring to one of the city's most popular park areas
the people from the local council arrived very early asking us to show our papers
they told us
you can do only trees
you can't do lamp posts or benches
if i have a message it is
come on
she laughs it's art
we're doing it to make people happy
hopefully later on here in chile they can allow us to be more free
in an environment where machine made goods dominate and social interaction has become increasingly digitized <unk> yarn bombers offer a refreshing take on an ancient craft that <unk> back to a time when communities were truly closely knit
as de santiago says
sometimes just a little bit of change can bring about another change and then another until you have a chain of changes and when you think of it like that it's a revolution

luxury meets <unk> at <unk> two thousand and fifteen
strange case of the melting house and other mind bending buildings
they are ready to be injected into the most delicate areas of a human body the heart and the brain to deliver drugs with extreme precision or work like an army of nano surgeons operating from within
if it all sounds like science fiction that's because it is
the plot of the one thousand nine hundred and sixty six sci fi classic fantastic voyage revolves largely around this concept
in the film four people board a <unk> submarine to enter the bloodstream of an american scientist left <unk> by the russians as a result of a cold war <unk> over the technology
they only have an hour to remove a life threatening blood clot before they return to full size
the crew manage to escape the body in the nick of time via a <unk>
but reality has a way of catching up with our fantasies and nanotechnology is yet another field of science that bears that promise
at <unk> zurich the swiss federal institute of technology mechanical engineer brad nelson and his team have worked on nanobots for a decade and are now ready to think big
we're making microscopic robots that are guided by externally generated magnetic fields for use in the human body he told cnn
the first to suggest that you could one day swallow the surgeon was beloved physicist and nobel prize winner richard <unk>
he coined the idea in the provocative one thousand nine hundred and fifty nine talk there's plenty of room at the bottom which is widely considered the first <unk> argument for nanotechnology
you put the mechanical surgeon inside the blood vessel and it goes into the heart and looks around <unk> said it finds out which valve is the faulty one and takes a little knife and slices it out
<unk> <unk> might not yet have a little knife but they sure have something special
their shape is inspired by the common <unk> bacteria which is propelled by a rotating tail called the <unk>
bacteria have a <unk> motor he explains now we can't make that motor we don't have the technology for that but we can use <unk> to move these things so we actually take these <unk> and we <unk> them which allows them to swim
the nanobots have already been tested in vivo in an extremely delicate environment the eye
they can swim through the <unk> humor the clear gel that fills the <unk> and deliver drugs in the <unk> area to treat age related diseases such as macular degeneration which can cause blindness
the robots are made in a clean room environment to keep them sterile much in the same way as computer chips
nelson says that the test done with eyes have inspired other potential applications such as the treatment of heart conditions
in this case the nanobots would be guided through a <unk> two to three millimeters in diameter to reach the specific part of tissue that needs to be treated
the <unk> technique could also be used to reach the brain and other target area include the smaller intestine and the urinary track
all difficult to reach areas where precision is a must
for that very reason nanotechnology has long been touted as our best future weapon against cancer
but how would surgeons operate with nanobots
they would need training to learn how to use them says nelson but it's kind of an intuitive interface and the nanobots would be guided with a <unk>
the technology is ready for the first clinical tests on human patients which will begin to take place this year according to nelson
more recently people in the field have been looking at other applications like water treatment or environmental cleanup where you might be able to operate hundreds thousands millions of these devices and have them swim through polluted water <unk> pollutants and then collect them back he says
this could be applied for example to oil <unk>
there have been some recent publications that have shown how they can actually attach to oil <unk> and move them to other locations
but the most outlandish prediction on the use of nanotechnology comes from mit's digital guru nicholas <unk> who believes that in the future we will receive information and knowledge directly from nanobots that will swim up to our brain from within our bloodstream
we'd love to hear what richard <unk> would have had to say about swallowing the teacher

according to the california department of public health website fifty two of those cases are linked to an outbreak at disneyland
there are four confirmed cases in riverside county where the desert sands unified school district told sixty six students who have either not been vaccinated for measles or can't show proof that they need to stay home
cnn affiliate <unk> reported that one student at palm desert high school is suspected of having had measles
the student has been cleared to return to class but health officials are still trying to determine if the student actually had measles
for now the others will have to study at their homes
they are going to be asked to stay home until the incubation period for contagion is complete a spokeswoman for the school district mary perry said of the students who were released
the earliest a student can return without proof of vaccination is february nine the station reported
of the seventy nine california cases fifteen are in los angeles county and all victims were unvaccinated for measles said dr. jeffrey gunzenhauser the county's interim health officer
of those fifteen county cases fourteen are linked to disneyland gunzenhauser said
in l.a. county we're fortunately highly vaccinated
five percent or less are unvaccinated gunzenhauser said
there are sixteen cases linked to disneyland outside california
arizona officials said they have identified one thousand contacts of the seven cases in their states
they're asking anyone within that group to isolate themselves for twenty one days if he or she isn't vaccinated
the disease outbreak became apparent when visitors reported coming down with measles after visiting the park from december fifteen to december twenty
at least five disney employees have been diagnosed with measles disney said
also the families of one hundred and ninety five children in mesa arizona have been contacted because they were in an urgent care clinic with someone who has measles
midway across the country at the university of minnesota a student who had traveled abroad is self isolating after contracting the disease the school said in a statement
the university is working to find everyone who may have been exposed to the student who attended class four days last week
though students have largely been immunized because of enrollment requirements the university warned anyone who had not been vaccinated to be vigilant
minnesota is one of twenty seven states that reported measles cases last year according to the centers for disease control and prevention
the six hundred and forty four cases reported in two thousand and fourteen mark a stark spike compared with recent years
since two thousand and one the number of cases has topped one hundred only five times and two thousand and eleven was the only year in which cases topped two hundred

two russian bombers caused disruption to civil aviation when they flew near but did not cross into british airspace on wednesday the foreign office representative said
two uk royal air force jets intercepted the bombers both capable of carrying nuclear weapons south of <unk> england over the english channel a uk defense spokesman said thursday
the british jets escorted the bombers for about an hour and a half until the bombers left the area the defense spokesman said
russian aircraft maneuvers yesterday are part of increasing pattern of out of area operations by russian aircraft the foreign office representative said
the representative did not elaborate on how civil aviation was disrupted
details about what the russian ambassador has told britain about the incident weren't immediately available
wednesday's incident would be the latest in what nato has said is an increase in russian military flights near alliance members territory
in november nato said its members jets had been scrambled more than four hundred times in two thousand and fourteen to intercept russian military flights close to members territories a fifty percents increase over the previous year
the increase <unk> back to the days of the cold war nato secretary general jens stoltenberg said november twenty during a visit to nato member estonia
this pattern is risky and <unk> stoltenberg said
so nato remains vigilant
we are here
and we are ready to defend all allies against any threat
in a november report the european leadership network listed more than forty close military encounters between russia and the west in the eight months from march to october
three of those including a near collision between a russian military plane and a swedish passenger aircraft carrying one hundred and thirty two people were classified as high risk incidents that could have led to direct military confrontation between russia and the west according to the report titled dangerous <unk>

<unk> jewish community spokesman <unk> perugia said on twitter that he and the head of <unk> jewish community <unk> <unk> had been filming with a tv crew from italy's <unk> five following a ceremony tuesday to mark seventy years since the camp's liberation
the crew had finished their work at eleven p.m. and the group tried to leave he said
but group members found they were locked in the camp in <unk> temperatures with no security guards in sight
<unk> <unk> then pushed through a window that was in the ticket sales building and the window opened up perugia said
he entered and then opened the door for us
at that point the alarm went off
and we thought good finally someone from security will come to let us out
however at this point their night got worse perugia said
the security guard arrived indeed but instead of letting us go they kept us there
for hours and hours and hours
they started to <unk> us and they treated us like real criminals he said
perugia said the guards were <unk> and insisted on following procedure
eventually they took the party to the auschwitz police station he said where they were kept until five thirty a.m. and questioned one by one
they don't know how to distinguish between the real criminals and those who were there simply to do an interview and honor the day of memory he said
the incident ended with the party writing down their version of events perugia said adding that they had asked for the matter to be looked into through italian diplomatic channels
a spokesman for the auschwitz museum gave cnn a different account of the <unk> events however
<unk> sawicki said the italian tv crew had permission to film at the site until eleven point three zero p.m. when they had agreed that they would exit and security guards would come to the gate to let them out
he said cctv footage shows they finished early and went to the gate a few minutes past eleven p.m. rather than waiting for the security guards to come at the agreed time one of them broke into the visitor center and let others in too he said
this triggered an alarm so the security guards came to the building which houses cash registers and an atm
according to protocol they asked the men to show id but they refused to do so sawicki said
the police had to be called since they can only demand that people show id documents he said
the police then arrived and took over the matter he said
while being on the site we have to follow the rules sawicki said
so until the unfortunate incident everything was ok because they had our permission they cooperated with our security and they had the time that they declared they would be leaving
he said the group could also have gone to another exit one hundred and fifty meters away where the security guards were based if they wanted to leave earlier and could then have been let out of that gate
however they decided to act outside the regulations and triggered the security alarm and triggered the whole reaction and then refused to cooperate
auschwitz is a priceless heritage place he said
it must be protected and there must be security

the interconnected nature of the global marketplace left them vulnerable to <unk> effects from events as diverse as revolution in the middle east growing cybercrime in europe or the rise of new <unk> in india
rather than simply taking caring of their own operation business leaders must prioritize efforts to anticipate these events
the role has become more complex demanding new skills and responsibilities says dr. michael <unk> one of the report authors at sad business school
many ceos feel the need to let go of operational activities
one ceo quoted in the report had <unk> his role <unk> day to day responsibilities in order to concentrate fully on the thirty five thousand <unk> level looking for ripples outside the company
hovering above the business his customers consumers competitors and other market players continuously searching the environment for emerging connections
increased liabilities have also forced ceos to think more short term with several reporting that traditional three five year plans are being replaced with more flexible responsive one hundred day cycles
the implementation of ripple intelligence is far from a precise science at this stage based on a mix of traditional planning and technology advances
a popular practice is the use of big data and how it relates to scenario planning which is an established business technique says <unk>
it involves an extension of that technique to connect different scenarios to consider how they interact and look further into the future
<unk> expects the process to be refined and made more accurate with practice and competition and as the data sets expand
many of the major events such as wars and market crashes can be predicted to an extent with access to the relevant data he believes
the increased transparency of the digital age has also made ceos more accountable and accessible to a massive new set of stakeholders
online criticism from any source can hit any company's reputation and subsequent performance
greater transparency and vulnerability has <unk> the traditional conception of ceo power shifting the model from command control to collaborative control according to <unk>
but reduced control has had a <unk> effect
among the report's key findings is the widespread acceptance of doubt among ceos allowing them to factor and work with it rather than feel pressure to deliver guaranteed outcomes
doubt is part of the <unk> of the ceo a positive <unk> state that should be embraced and utilized not feared the report notes adding that doubt facilitates greater collaboration and openness
as one <unk> puts it the modern ceo must get comfortable with discomfort
as <unk> multiply so do the opportunities

more than one hundred people were inside <unk> maternal hospital when the blast occurred at about seven a.m. minutes after a hose burst on a truck supplying gas to the building
paramedics carried bloodied victims on stretchers
<unk> lugo <unk> told cnnmexico she spent ten minutes trapped under rubble before rescuers reached her
the supervising nurse called her husband mario angeles sanchez after the blast
as she described what was happening he heard people in the background screaming for help
i am still a little bit in shock
it was a nightmare she said describing how hospital workers tried to rescue babies from a nursery as flames engulfed the building
a nurse and two babies were killed by the blast mexico city health secretary <unk> <unk> told cnn affiliate <unk>
at least seventy three people were injured he said including about twenty newborns
officials initially reported a higher death toll but later said a mix up between the number of those deceased and those seriously injured led to an incorrect report
outside the hospital frantic family members searched for word of loved ones they feared were inside
searching continued thursday evening at the site though officials said it appeared everyone had been accounted for
jose eduardo was relieved to learn his wife and son who was born on wednesday had survived the blast
he heard about the explosion on the news from his home where he'd gone to rest after the baby was born
he rushed to the hospital to be by his wife's side
she told me that it started to smell like gas and the ceiling started to fall on everyone he told cnnmexico
she covered up the baby and ran
his wife was barefoot when she escaped he said
others were naked
we started pulling babies from the debris who were alive <unk> a volunteer at the scene told cnn
we pulled out fortunately i think we pulled out seven
we would've wanted to pull out more
witnesses said the explosion shook the neighborhood
we heard something and it smelled so much like gas really a lot
and then two minutes three seconds later we saw an explosion that made everything fly in the air witness teresa <unk> told cnnmexico
it threw me to the ground
virginia gonzalez who lives near the hospital said her <unk> was covered with broken glass from blown out windows
after the explosion mexicans eager to help lined up at hospitals where victims were being treated offering to donate blood and bringing bottled water and diapers for survivors
lugo the nurse who was inside the hospital during the explosion told cnnmexico she is suffering from first degree burns but feels lucky to be alive
i feel grateful to have another chance to keep living she said to keep working as a nurse
first calls came into firefighters reporting a gas leak at the hospital a facility on the southwest outskirts of mexico city that is part of the government health system
hospital workers had already started <unk> the building when the explosion happened minutes later mayor miguel angel mancera told reporters
one of the city's publicly accessible <unk> captured the blast showing a plume of smoke rising from the direction of the hospital
a truck was supplying gas to the hospital when apparently a hose burst and the resulting leak caused an explosion mancera said
the driver and two assistants delivering the gas have been detained <unk> office told cnnmexico
two of the detained workers are hospitalized and one is receiving other medical care the office said
the gas in question is known as liquefied petroleum gas a mix that could be mostly propane or mostly butane
these propane butane mixes are commonly used in mexico for heating cooking and other fuel applications
gas express <unk> the company that owned the truck has operated in mexico city since two thousand and seven and has a contract to supply gas to hospitals run by the mexico city government the mayor said
the hospital is seventy percents collapsed mancera said although some walls and steel columns are still standing
yet in his mind he had to go into war torn syria
the experienced journalist explained why in a video shot in october from southern turkey
he felt compelled to tell the stories of war in all its trauma complexity and humanity
syrian people suffering for three years and a half
it's enough the forty seven year old goto explained
so i would like to get the story of what isis wants to do
so goto crossed the border into syria and headed toward the islamist extremist group's de facto capital of <unk> despite the advice of friend alaaeddin al zaim who'd been with him previously in that nation
al zaim recalled telling goto it's not safe for you
the journalist replied that he didn't feel he was in danger
after all his native japan unlike the iraqi government and the international coalition supporting it wasn't involved in the military fight against the terrorist group that's branded itself as the islamic state
i am not american
i am not british
i am japanese goto said according to al zaim i can go
it appears to have been a mistake
a new isis video released saturday appeared to show the decapitated body of goto
while the authenticity of the video could not immediately be established by cnn japanese officials did not challenge news of his apparent death
we are deeply saddened by this despicable and horrendous act of terrorism and we denounce it in the strongest terms prime minister shinzo abe said in tokyo
goto covered big news stories for years hoping that by telling them he could make a difference in the world
his work was featured by numerous japanese organizations including broadcaster nhk
and he wasn't afraid to put himself in harm's way to tell a story
one need just look to his previous trip to syria where a bloody complicated civil war has gone on for four years
the united nations estimated in august that nearly two hundred thousand had been killed more than three million syrians had become refugees and at least six point five million were displaced inside the country
while there goto came to know another japanese man a forty two year old aspiring security contractor haruna yukawa
according to yukawa's friend nobuo kimoto goto passed along insights on how to survive in syria and introduced him to rebel fighters who are distinct from isis though both are fighting syrian president bashar al assad's forces
the fact the two japanese men's paths had crossed again became public january twenty in an isis video posted to social media
it shows goto and yukawa dressed in orange kneeling in front of a masked black clad man
in it the isis militant gives the japanese government a choice to pay two hundred million dollar the same amount of money prime minister shinzo abe recently pledged for those contending with isis to free the japanese men within seventy two hours
days later a new message was posted by known isis supporters featuring the voice of someone claiming to be goto
yukawa apparently was dead
and so soon would goto the new message claimed unless jordan's government freed its longtime prisoner sajida al rishawi a convicted terrorist
on saturday the latest isis video showed the masked man blaming japan's humanitarian support of coalition efforts in iraq and syria for goto's apparent beheading
japan's government insisted it did everything within reason that it could to bring goto home safely
the fate of moath al kasasbeh a jordanian pilot recently captured by isis while on a military mission targeting the islamist extremist group is unclear
he was not shown or mentioned in the video
speaking out for the first time thursday goto's wife rinko said her husband was taken from me october twenty five although she didn't know it until a december two message from his captors landed in her inbox
now after working tirelessly behind the scenes she went public to beg the jordanian and japanese governments to understand that the fates of both are in their hands
her statement comes after she got another email wednesday with the hostage takers final demand
our baby girl was only three weeks old when kenji left
i hope our oldest daughter who is just two will get to see her father again rinko said on thursday
i want them both to grow up knowing their father
as to why goto left in the first place his wife said my husband is a good and honest man who went to syria to show the plight of those who suffer
i believe that kenji may have also been trying to find out about haruna yukawa's situation
i know all too well what are going through
the japanese <unk> mother junko ishido had spoken out previously trying to save a man she insists is not the enemy of isis
while goto's decision to go to syria surprised his mother his rationale did not
ishido said kenji always has been a kind person ever since he was little
he was always saying i want to save the lives of children in war zones
and now goto has become a victim in a war a fact that's tearing ishido apart
i'm shedding tears of sorrow i just can't think of any words to say but i don't want this sorrow to create a chain of hatred she said saturday
kenji worked for children who suffered from conflicts and poverty and his goal was to create a society without war
i want to pass on his thoughts to people around the world
who is jordanian pilot moath al kasasbeh captured by isis
after thirty five years of service the huge skeleton of a <unk> is being retired from its leading role at london's natural history museum to be replaced by the equally hulking bones of a blue whale
looming over the museum's central <unk> <unk> hall <unk> the <unk> has rendered generations of young visitors <unk>
it's also taken starring roles in movies including the recently released <unk> and the one thousand nine hundred and seventy five disney classic one of our dinosaurs is missing
the two hundred and ninety two bone skeleton is actually a replica cast from <unk> <unk> by railroad workers in wyoming in one thousand eight hundred and ninety eight
now the museum wants to substitute it with a genuine skeleton from its own collection
that of an even bigger creature the blue whale
as the largest known animal to have ever lived on earth the story of the blue whale reminds us of the scale of our responsibility to the planet says the museum's director michael <unk>
this makes it the perfect choice of specimen to welcome and capture the imagination of our visitors as well as marking a major transformation of the museum
the skeleton <unk> isn't a speedy process
work to install the whale won't be completed until the summer of two thousand and seventeen
the twenty five point two meter female whale has been part of the museum's collection since one thousand eight hundred and ninety one after it was found <unk> and injured off the southeast coast of ireland
it's bones bought for two hundred and fifty have previously been displayed in the museum's mammal hall suspended over a life size model of a blue whale
<unk> says that bumping <unk> from its top slot was an important and necessary change that would highlight the plight of a species under threat from mankind
the blue whale serves as a poignant reminder that while abundance is no guarantee of survival through our choices we can make a real difference he adds
the museum which gets five million visitors a year says it's exploring how the <unk> cast can be enjoyed by an even wider audience longer term
so <unk> isn't heading for the bone yard just yet

call it the battle of the <unk>
but when murray and berdych met thursday for a spot in the final of the australian open it was the scot who was a cut above his czech opponent
murray reached a fourth final in melbourne when he beat berdych six seven six zero six three seven five in an ill tempered affair meaning he is on the verge of winning a third grand slam title and first since he ended britain's nearly eighty year drought at wimbledon in two thousand and thirteen
murray complained to chair umpire pascal maria about something berdych said after the first set ended and berdych didn't appear pleased at murray's reaction when the two thousand and ten wimbledon finalist dropped his serve at five three in the first
television cameras also seemed to show murray's fiancee kim <unk> <unk> an <unk> towards berdych or his camp which included dani <unk> who used to coach murray during the match
when there's a lot of tension surrounding something which you created then it's completely normal that the whole first set everyone was tight murray told reporters taking a swipe at the media
my physical trainer <unk> i'm sure for dani it was uncomfortable
even tomas who very rarely says anything on the court there was tension there for him as well
yeah in the heat of the moment you can say stuff that you regret
it wouldn't be the first time a player's partner <unk> an opponent and roger federer's wife <unk> seemed to do it to defending australian open champion stan wawrinka at the world tour finals in november
regardless berdych downplayed talk of bad blood between him and murray
he said he was simply trying to pump himself up after winning the first set
i say to myself well done tomas
that's it berdych told reporters
i think i'm allowed to do that when i win a set
i pumped myself up
and that's it then sit on the chair
i'm not really looking left or right what's going on
i just keep focusing myself and that's it
there is no really big deal about anything what was happening today on the court
i mean it was a great battle
it was a good match
unfortunately with a bad end for me
berdych upset fourteen time grand slam champion rafael nadal in the quarterfinals and he picked up where he left off in the semifinals using his <unk> power to break for five three
but after he was broken straight back things swung in murray's favor despite berdych claiming the roughly eighty minute first set
<unk> intensity dropped and so did his first serve percentage
murray meanwhile upped his game stepping up the attack from the baseline and playing his <unk> defense when needed
he pointed to his own camp which featured coach <unk> <unk> when the match ended
i got asked all the time about my ex coach working with tomas and no one was interested in anything i was doing with <unk> or the way i was playing or anything murray said
murray can now sit back and watch friday's other semifinal between top seed novak djokovic and wawrinka
djokovic is attempting to win a fifth australian open title
he downed murray in the two thousand and eleven and two thousand and thirteen finals

<unk> accused iran and hezbollah of planning an attack from syria on the golan area which is under israeli control
this reflects a general picture that iran and hezbollah are trying to heat up the region and golan heights area because it is easy for them to operate in
he warned against such attacks saying
the idf is ready and we will not allow any terror parties to act against us

two thousand and fourteen was a year of profound fear for communities living with and dying of the disease
of health workers making the ultimate sacrifice dying as they tried to save
of apocalyptic forecasts as to the disease's possible spread
with eight thousand eight hundred and ten dead governments and aid agencies are now giving a timeline on when they might reach zero cases and they're saying that could be in just a few months
that there are just a handful of cases left now in liberia is an incredible feat but it has come at an equally incredible cost
and ebola is still critically dangerous
<unk> remain
sierra leone has sixty five confirmed cases most in the west of the country around the capital and port <unk> where the disease spreads through <unk> slums
the world health organisation said last week that only half the cases in liberia and guinea came from known ebola contacts which suggests that hidden cases are causing outbreaks
even as states of emergency and quarantine restrictions are lifted there is a chorus of warnings against complacency
a single new case is enough to reignite an outbreak says <unk> de la <unk> director of operations at medecins sans frontieres
until everyone who has come into contact with ebola is identified we can not rest easy
and getting to zero can't be the end of it
oxfam is calling for a massive post ebola marshall plan saying the world can not <unk> on recovery as it <unk> over ebola
their plea comes as the who and other agencies engage in intense soul searching
what went wrong
why did it take so long to turn the corner on this disease
could it happen again
admitting to organizational shortcomings margaret chan the who's director general has asked the world's wealthier nations to step up to the plate and support poor countries fragile health care systems
well functioning health systems are not a luxury she insists
well functioning health systems are the cushion that keeps sudden <unk> from <unk> throughout the fabric that holds societies together ripping them apart
liberia sierra leone and guinea have never had well functioning health systems
they have always had some of the lowest ratio of healthcare workers to patients in the world
liberia had just one doctor for every one hundred thousand people in two thousand and thirteen according to who figures
that works out at around forty doctors for the whole country
sierra leone had two per one hundred thousand people
and there weren't even statistics for guinea
then ebola destroyed what little healthcare they had taking the lives of four hundred and eighty eight health workers and leaving people too terrified to go through the doors of clinics they saw as <unk> of the disease
children weren't vaccinated against other critical diseases
centers distributing anti <unk> to the tens of thousands of people with hiv were closed
mothers gave birth at home
now trust in the region's decimated health care system is beginning albeit painfully slowly to return
at a clinic in monrovia mothers fill a waiting room
they've brought their babies in to be vaccinated there are no disneyland immunization issues here
we know that during the height of the epidemic immunization rates collapsed by some seventy percents says sheldon <unk> <unk> country representative in liberia
now we're trying to climb back up but it will take time
placing preliminary healthcare within the community has also been a success
<unk> and ebola treatment units have been followed by community care <unk> or <unk>
the first were built in november in sierra leone
now there are dozens in sierra leone and liberia
their basic aim is to provide a place within the community where people can be isolated and provided with preliminary care pain relief and oral rehydration in an environment which is safe and humane
susan michaels <unk> project director of the global nurse capacity building programme at the <unk> school of public health at colombia university has just spent three weeks assessing the impact of these <unk> in sierra leone
she thinks they've played a huge role in restoring people's faith in ebola related care
we saw some amazing innovation she explains
where the family members can see their loved ones who have ebola so they're not taken behind a blue fence and never seen again
and even if the person doesn't survive they saw the care that was provided they saw the attempts to save the life
the original idea behind the <unk> was to train local volunteers in infection control procedures and have them man the units
but it turned out there were better options
what the various partners found when they went into these communities was that there were people there were nursing students there were retired nurses there were nurses who had left the profession but had the skills the ability and the desire to help says michaels <unk>
and for all the fear the <unk> and the stigma around the disease there's a clear sense of pride amongst those who are leading the charge against ebola at a community level
<unk> <unk> is from guinea's forest region
aged eighteen years old he survived ebola and now he goes from village to village spreading the word about the disease
even <unk> will listen to me more than they would to you because i have been a victim of ebola he says beaming with pride
<unk> <unk> says she is happy to be working as a nurse at the <unk> <unk> <unk> community care centre in sierra leone
my conscience if i saved one person here i'm thinking that i have saved the whole nation
that makes me feel good
the ebola outbreak has helped create some <unk> pulled together infrastructure which could form the building blocks of a more robust healthcare system in these three <unk> countries
and the disease leaves behind people <unk> for action as a result of their ordeal
now the question is how to use these resources to transition from an emergency response situation to more sustainable healthcare provision in the future
guinea liberia and sierra leone had a combined total of ninety nine new cases for the week ending january twenty five the who said
the total breaks down to sixty five in sierra leone thirty in guinea and four in liberia
the number of cases continued to fall in liberia and sierra leone who said but guinea's figure rose from twenty confirmed cases in the previous week
the western district of <unk> where the local community has shown high levels of resistance to measures to limit the disease's spread was the worst affected in guinea with half the new cases for the week the report said
the response to the ebola epidemic has now moved to a second phase who said as the focus shifts from slowing transmission to ending the epidemic
to achieve this goal as quickly as possible efforts have moved from rapidly building infrastructure to ensuring that capacity for case finding case management safe burials and community engagement is used as effectively as possible
there have been more than twenty two thousand reported confirmed probable and suspected cases since the outbreak began with almost eight thousand eight hundred known deaths
according to the latest who report children are less susceptible than adults to contracting the virus which spreads through direct contact with an infected person's bodily fluids
people aged fifteen to forty four are approximately three times more likely to be affected than children aged up to fourteen while adults aged forty five and older are almost four times more likely to be affected than are children
even as the number of cases drops scientists around the world continue to study the virus in a bid to understand how it works and help develop more effective vaccines against it
dr. <unk> sakuntabhai human geneticist at the <unk> institute in paris is part of a team working to sequence the virus and monitor how it <unk>
it's very important for us to follow what happens with the virus sequence he told cnn
while the virus is not that mutated yet he said it's important for us to monitor how it changes and see whether it is more contagious or more lethal
his team is using samples from blood collected from guinea and processed by colleagues based in dakar senegal who've been working on the ebola project since april last year
<unk> team has sequenced about twenty samples so far and hopes to do another one hundred in the coming weeks ultimately sequencing several hundred
many people's fears have focused on whether the virus could change to become airborne but it doesn't appear to be easy for it to mutate sufficiently to alter the mode of transmission he said
sakuntabhai said it was normal for the virus to change and that it's not something to be frightened of at the moment
the three hundred mw lake turkana wind power project which is being developed in the country's north east hopes to produce twenty percents of the country's current installed electricity generating capacity when it comes online in two thousand and sixteen
the six hundred and ninety four million dollar project achieved full financial close in december two thousand and fourteen making it the largest private investment in kenyan history
the success of this project even though it has taken a long time to become successful will inspire confidence in investors says william <unk> sub saharan african energy analyst at african energy consultancy
it's a renewable plant which is harder to get right than other power plants and that it looks like it will be online relatively soon shows the government has got its priorities right
the project is one part of the country's ambitious project to add five thousand mw of power onto the grid in the next three years
an international consortium of lenders and producers which includes the african development bank british company <unk> international and standard bank is aiming to install three hundred and sixty five wind turbines
the fifty two meter blade span windmills will take advantage of high winds in the remote area
these <unk> conditions are set to cause a jobs <unk>
over the thirty two months when the hardware will be installed and new roads built the project will employ as many as two thousand five hundred people on a temporary basis
once the wind farm is up and running two hundred people will be employed at the site on a full time basis throughout the operating period
and such confidence in kenya's power sector was badly needed after disappointments elsewhere
the <unk> <unk> power plant near mombasa has suffered long delays after the procurement process failed to produce a viable partner for the government who wanted to build the <unk> natural gas facility in just eighteen months
if all goes well with the lake turkana project as we expect it will relieve some of the pressure on the country's energy targets explains <unk>
the turkana investment which is expected to generate one hundred and fifty million dollar a year in foreign currency savings to kenya could have an impact on houses and businesses that are forced to use diesel generators during power black outs
indeed in early january a transmission line failure left over half the country without power for four hours
according to kenya power the country's main electricity transmission company there were three widespread interruptions of power affecting seventy five percents of the country in two thousand and fourteen
in the first month of two thousand and fifteen we saw approximately nine interruptions per one thousand customers in one month at the household level explains benson <unk> general manager of network management at kenya power
the plan is to bring that down to two interruptions per one thousand customers by two thousand and sixteen or two thousand and seventeen
state owned power company <unk> produces approximately eighty percents of electricity consumed in kenya and of that sixty five percents comes from <unk> power sources
it is <unk> which provides the power to kenya power
while <unk> in nairobi are not so frequent as they once were there is still an issue with electricity supply says <unk>
the government will want to move away from reliance on <unk> as rainfall patterns are unreliable in the region
and as demand for electricity grows that issue is not going away
electricity consumption grew by nine percents between two thousand and ten and two thousand and eleven according to the institute of economic affairs and some estimates say demand will grow by a further twelve percents by two thousand and thirty
as well as adding to electricity supply some businesses will also be hoping the lake turkana wind power project contributes to a decrease in power bills
according to the norwegian investment fund for developing countries kenya power will buy the power produced at the turkana wind farm at a fixed price over twenty years
but it's not just the east african country investing in renewable energy
according to <unk> <unk> ministry of energy is planning a thirteen billion dollar expansion of wind solar and <unk> power generation projects as part of the country's goal to make <unk> forty two percents of the energy mix by two thousand and twenty
ghana meanwhile is constructing the world's fourth largest solar farm
the <unk> project in the country's western region will have an installed capacity of one hundred and fifty five <unk> when it becomes operational later this year
while these projects will help build energy supply on the continent the international energy agency has said sub saharan africa needs to invest three hundred billion dollar in order to achieve universal electricity access by two thousand and thirty
once up and running the turkana wind power project will have the largest amount of wind turbines on the continent even more than the three hundred mw <unk> wind farm in morocco which is currently africa's biggest wind farm with one hundred and thirty one turbines
it will also be larger than <unk> power generating complex in neighboring ethiopia which opened in october two thousand and thirteen
construction is set to begin early two thousand and fifteen but if the lake turkana wind power project does what it's supposed to then <unk> could be in for fewer <unk> and a more connected future
we can expect the lake turkana wind power project to bring change gradually says kenya power's <unk>
as demand for electricity grows we will see electricity generated from wind turbines play a more important role in kenya's and reduce power costs in the country

prior to the announcement of his death a message purportedly from isis had presented an ultimatum to jordan
bring convicted terrorist sajida al rishawi to the turkish border by sunset january twenty nine or the pilot will die
tied to his fate was that of japanese hostage kenji goto whose apparent beheading was shown in a video released by isis militants over the weekend
jordan had said it was ready to release al rishawi if al kasasbeh were to be released unharmed
reeling with shock at how the pilot was murdered jordanian officials were said to be considering a military response to isis's claims
king abdullah condemned the killing and said that the brave pilot was killed in defense of his religion his country and his nation
it is the duty of the sons and daughters of jordan to stand together and show the <unk> of the jordanian people in unity determination and resolve the king said
a jordanian official said the pilot was actually killed a month ago in early january
the purported <unk> is a macabre closure to al kasasbeh's life
while he was still considered missing the family's desperation grew as time passed and as al kasasbeh's fate was linked to that of goto and the release of al rishawi
goto appeared to hold a picture of the pilot now bearded in a video message purported to be from isis that was released in january
on the same day safi al kasasbeh joined hundreds of fellow jordanians at a solidarity protest held in the capital amman where he called on the jordanian authorities to act to secure his son's release
i firmly ask whomever has sent moath to fight outside the borders of jordan on a mission unrelated to us to make strong efforts to bring back moath he said
<unk> blood is precious
it's precious and it represents the blood of all jordanians he said
the plight of moath al kasasbeh resonated with king abdullah who has been a pillar of the international effort against isis and is himself a former helicopter pilot
the young captive hailed from a high ranking tribe considered especially loyal to the royal family
abdullah's wife queen <unk> posted an image to her four hundred thousand instagram followers shortly after meeting with the pilot's family
we are all moath it said in arabic beneath a picture representing a fighter jet in the colors of the jordanian flag
from the start jordan has played a pivotal part in the u.s. led coalition against isis but it was not a popular war within jordan which only added to the pressure on the authorities to secure al kasasbeh's release
in late december isis published in its english language online magazine <unk> what it claimed was an interview with the pilot
al kasasbeh was shown wearing what appeared to be an orange <unk>
asked whether he knew what isis would do with him he replied
yes
they will kill me
the militants claimed they captured al kasasbeh after he ejected from the crashing of his f sixteen on december twenty four
the pilot was part of the u.s. led coalition airstrikes near isis de facto capital raqqa
images provided by isis's media wing and circulated widely on social media showed bearded men with kalashnikovs pulling the terrified <unk> out of a nearby river
we entered the region of raqqa to sweep the area then the striker jets entered to begin their attack al kasasbeh said according to the online publication
my plane was struck by a heat seeking missile
i heard and felt its hit
the jordanian government and u.s. central command said the aircraft had crashed but adamantly stated isis had not shot it down as the group claims
i checked the system display and it indicated that the engine was damaged and burning the pilot was quoted as saying
the plane began to deviate from its normal flight path so i ejected
i landed in the <unk> river by parachute and the seat caught on some ground keeping me fixed until i was captured by soldiers of the islamic state
that was the question following a new message purportedly from the terrorist group that pushed jordan to bring convicted terrorist sajida al rishawi to the turkish border by five thirty p.m.
if they didn't according to the message jordanian pilot moaz al kassasbeh would be killed followed soon thereafter by kenji goto of japan
for days jordanian officials have said they're willing to swap al rishawi for al kassasbeh
government spokesman mohammed al momani reiterated as much late thursday afternoon about an hour before the purported deadline
he said jordan is not about to pull off a deal yet having received no proof that its pilot is still alive
we need a proof of life so we can proceed the government spokesman said
if jordan gets such proof and releases al rishawi it is not clear whether that would mean goto also goes free
or al kassasbeh for that matter
so the drama continues with so much unsettled and so much on the line
early friday japan's foreign minister described the situation as still fluid and changing
we need to continue to deal with this in a state of alert <unk> <unk> told reporters
isis has shown its willingness to kill hostages before the first being american journalist james foley last summer and the latest being haruna yukawa an aspiring security contractor from japan reportedly killed last week
but is it willing to negotiate with governments that are fighting to stop its brutal expansive campaign to expand what it calls the islamic state
the drama is coming after the latest message posted by isis supporters purportedly featuring goto's voice
cnn could not independently confirm the authenticity of the latest message which was read by a person claiming to be goto and posted online by isis supporters
al momani said that the competent authorities are still checking on the authenticity of the recent recording state tv reported about two hours before the possible deadline
it follows another recording in which isis at first demanded two hundred million dollar to free goto and yukawa
a few days later there was a new message this one with a man's voice claiming to be goto saying that the terror group was dropping its ransom request and instead demanding a swap of the japanese journalist for al rishawi
in the third recording in this string goto purportedly gives jordan twenty four hours to release the convicted terrorist in exchange for my life
jordanian foreign minister nasser judeh had said his country would release al rishawi if isis released al kassasbeh
judeh has said that the japanese journalist has not been forgotten
of course goto's release would be part of a prisoner exchange judeh said
but the priority for jordan he made clear is al kassasbeh's freedom
who are those involved in this complicated crisis involving several countries
al rishawi is an iraqi prisoner on death row in jordan for her role in two thousand and five bombings
goto an experienced war journalist has been at the center of several threats by isis since his capture
last week the group demanded two hundred million dollar from japan in exchange for goto and fellow japanese hostage haruna yukawa an aspiring security contractor
since then isis has claimed yukawa is dead but goto is still alive
al kassasbeh was captured by isis last month after the fighter jet he was flying crashed in syria
isis says he's still alive but jordan's foreign minister told cnn his government has asked for a proof of life but hasn't received it
they are not just captives but people with loved ones desperately seeking their release
the forty seven year old goto left japan last fall when his youngest of two daughters was a mere three weeks old
now his family including his wife rinko who heard from his captors first on december two and most recently in a wednesday email with their final demand wants him back
my husband is a good and honest man who went to syria to show the plight of those who suffer she said in a statement released through the rory <unk> trust a nonprofit focused on freelance journalists
i beg the jordanian and japanese government to understand that the fates of both are in their hands
relatives of the jordanian pilot captured after he ejected from his f sixteen jet last month near raqqa the extremist group's de facto capital in syria have also been outspoken pressing officials in amman to do all they can to secure his release
i firmly ask whomever has sent moaz to fight outside the borders of jordan on a mission unrelated to us to make strong efforts to bring back moaz the <unk> father safi al kassasbeh said tuesday adding that he believes his son's situation and goto's shouldn't be mixed up
safi al kassasbeh made his case again thursday evening after the sunset deadline had passed
i ask you in the name of god and his prophet and all the believers and the names of tens of millions in jordan and palestine in kindness to release my son and the son of all jordanians who is your brother in the islam religion and because forgiveness is a message of the prophet he told reporters
watch downward spiral
the case against aaron hernandez friday at nine p.m
et
these pieces of evidence as well as cellphone text messages and surveillance video will help build the state's case in the long anticipated massachusetts murder trial of former new england patriots player aaron hernandez a prosecutor told a jury during opening statements thursday
hernandez not only orchestrated but also participated and covered up the killing of his former friend <unk> lloyd prosecutor patrick <unk> said
for the defense the one time nfl star worth forty million dollar was targeted by police and prosecutors in the murder of the <unk> football player because of celebrity status
hernandez never had a chance as authorities <unk> in defense lawyer michael fee told the jury
the sensational trial which comes nearly three years after the <unk> tight end helped lead his team to super bowl <unk> <unk> friday with the victim's mother and girlfriend expected to testify
hernandez twenty five pleaded not guilty in the two thousand and thirteen killing of lloyd twenty seven who dated the sister of hernandez's fiance
two alleged accomplices <unk> wallace and carlos <unk> have pleaded not guilty and will be tried separately
an unexplained issue with a <unk> delayed the opening before vastly <unk> portraits of hernandez were presented to the jury
<unk> summed up the <unk> largely <unk> case telling the jury that hernandez and his associates killed lloyd and then took evidence with them and tried to and in some cases were successful in destroying evidence
the three picked up lloyd and drove to a <unk> area where the victim was shot six times <unk> said
but they allegedly left evidence at the scene and other places
the industrial park is in north <unk> about a mile from hernandez's home
the commonwealth will prove to you that he committed
the crime of murder the prosecutor said
a marijuana blunt found near lloyd's body had traces of both his dna and that of hernandez <unk> said
hernandez's dna also was found on <unk> caliber shell casing found in a car he had rented
a footprint at the industrial park where <unk> lloyd's body was dumped matched sneakers worn by hernandez the prosecutor said
though the motive for the killing is unclear <unk> said lloyd and hernandez were at a nightclub days before and the defendant appeared annoyed
hernandez was angry when he left the club
some of lloyd's relatives wept in court
<unk> ward lloyd's mother walked out at one point
fee sought to plant doubt in the jurors telling them police and prosecutors went after hernandez from the start
as soon as they found out aaron hernandez a celebrity football player for the new england patriots was a friend of <unk> lloyd's it was over he said
the prosecution will try to <unk> and distract you with the fruits of an investigation that was <unk> and <unk> fee said
the case against his client is just a story and it's not true the defense lawyer said
fee said hernandez had no motive to kill lloyd
he described the victim as one of his client's <unk> pals who was known as the blunt master for the marijuana cigars he often <unk> for hernandez
lloyd also dated the sister of hernandez's fiance <unk> jenkins fee said
the men could have been brother in laws
aaron hernandez is not the murderer of his friend fee said
in june two thousand and thirteen aaron hernandez was planning his future not a murder
one of the first witnesses called by the prosecution was high school student matthew kent who found lloyd's body
he testified that he was jogging home from a gym when he saw lloyd on the ground
he called out to the man
i got no response kent said
i was concerned
earlier in the day <unk> jenkins entered the courtroom and sat on the left side of the first row
next to her were the <unk> older brother dj hernandez and his mother terri hernandez
ward arrived with five people and sat on the opposite side of the front row
<unk> jenkins the sister of <unk> sat with ward
hernandez was <unk> when he entered the courtroom
the case has taken on renewed attention because the patriots are playing the seattle seahawks in sunday's super bowl and because owner bob kraft and head coach bill belichick are on the <unk> witness list
days after lloyd's slaying on june seventeen two thousand and thirteen hernandez went to gillette stadium in <unk> and had conversations with kraft and belichick about lloyd's death according to a law enforcement source with knowledge of the investigation
both meetings were face to face and kraft later told investigators that hernandez said he had nothing to do with lloyd's death the source told cnn
according to belichick the same was true and the head coach told authorities he spoke with hernandez about his whereabouts the night of lloyd's death the source added
the day hernandez was arrested belichick told reporters at a press conference he was shocked
since hernandez was arrested and charged in lloyd's death the <unk> case has changed significantly seemingly in hernandez's favor as the judge has barred prosecutors from using certain evidence legal analysts said
for example judge susan <unk> barred a text message from lloyd to his sister sent minutes before he was killed
the message stated that he was with nfl adding just so u know
the judge ruled the message wasn't enough proof that lloyd thought he was going to die
the defense argued the messages are innocuous suggesting lloyd could have been bragging about being with hernandez
the judge has also blocked any mention that hernandez has been indicted in connection with two other killings in boston
hernandez pleaded not guilty in the shooting deaths of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> outside a bar in boston in two thousand and twelve
a trial date hasn't been set
prosecutors will argue lloyd's killing was a joint venture
under massachusetts state law prosecutors don't necessarily have to prove who pulled the trigger
under joint venture anyone who actively <unk> in a murder can be held guilty according to legal experts
on june sixteen two thousand and thirteen lloyd was riding with friends in a black <unk> suburban which police later learned was rented by hernandez
close friend <unk> <unk> was with lloyd when he said lloyd got a text from hernandez asking to hang out later that night
as they <unk> ways lloyd told <unk> he'd see him later
lloyd's body was found the next day
the unlikely find could be nearly two hundred thousand years old and suggests a fourth type of ancient human who lived in asia long before homo <unk> ever came to be
three other known <unk> asian hominids include homo erectus found in java and china
the shorter homo <unk> from indonesia
and neanderthals in the russian <unk> mountains
scientists believe that human jaws and teeth became smaller as they evolved
but unlike other <unk> of the time the newly discovered <unk> is thick with large <unk> suggesting the existence of a different group
the new taiwan <unk> is clearly different than the known homo erectus populations from northern china and java and likely represents a group that has been <unk> so far researcher dr. <unk> <unk> told cnn
it's only one piece but the significance is huge
researchers from taiwan and japan named the ancient human <unk> one after the <unk> channel where the fossil was found
the team spent five years analyzing the bone which was difficult to date because it had been recovered from the sea
the findings reminded me that our knowledge is always very limited and we have very limited fossil records said <unk>
that's a great lesson for me

the revelations which came in the opening day of an inquest into the sixteen hour siege of a central sydney cafe are likely to further fuel questions about how new south wales police responded to the december fifteen incident especially their choice of weapons
of the five shots fired by man haron monis a self styled muslim cleric who took eighteen people hostage only one found a target counsel assisting the coroner jeremy gormly told the inquest
monis shot and killed cafe manager tori johnson execution style prompting police to storm the cafe in the early hours of december sixteen gormly said
victims of sydney siege
a mother of three and a beloved son
all the injuries that followed two fatal including those to monis and four non fatal were caused by police fire according to the evidence
the inquest is expected to examine whether the deaths of johnson the <unk> thirty four year old manager and katrina dawson a thirty eight year old lawyer could have been prevented
addressing those at the hearing which was closed to the public but open to hostages and victims families gormly outlined the events that led to the deaths of johnson dawson and the gunman
he said the first killing of johnson occurred at about two point one four a.m. shortly after a group of hostages fled the cafe
gormly described an execution style killing in which monis ordered johnson to kneel then simply shot him without further notice or warning in the back of the head
the end of the barrel was about seventy five centimeters from mr johnson's head at the moment of discharge he said
mr johnson is believed to have died immediately
the killing was witnessed by a police <unk> resulting in an immediate order to force entry he said
police then shot out the glass doors and windows threw in eleven <unk> producing flashes and <unk> and two armed tactical response officers entered firing twenty two shots
at least two police bullets or bullet fragments struck monis in the head and eleven other police bullets or fragments hit his body killing him instantly said gormly
but their rounds <unk> off the hard surfaces in the cafe killing dawson and injuring three other hostages and one of the response team who was struck in the face
ms dawson was struck by six fragments of a police bullet or bullets he said
gormly said the siege began after monis entered the lindt cafe at about eight point three three a.m. carrying a large backpack and a plastic bag containing a <unk> off shotgun and ordered chocolate cake and tea
he moved to a table with a clear view of the cafe then after about thirty minutes asked to speak with the manager
staff noticed that johnson's body language appeared tense
he called on an employee to fetch his keys lock the doors and remain calm
monis then stood up produced a shotgun and announced that he had a bomb before ordering hostages to hold up an islamic flag
he then ordered johnson to make an emergency call to authorities announcing that it was a terrorist attack and that there were bombs elsewhere
police arrived at the scene shortly after
several investigations into what occurred over the two days of the siege are underway including what information security agencies had on monis and how the police handled the crisis
lawyers representing dawson johnson and the police force will appear at the inquest as well as lawyers representing two tactical response officers
johnson's family members were in attendance as well as john o'brien one of the first hostages to escape
more than two feet of snow covered the streets and sidewalks shutting down boston's schools businesses and roadways this week
although streets were plowed snowfall obscured the iconic boston marathon finish line on <unk> street
one of the first photos to surface shows a man in dark clothing approaching the street with a <unk>
philip <unk> forty four took the photo and told cnn he was working out of a hotel room in downtown boston on tuesday afternoon because he didn't want to commute during the snowstorm and happened to notice something strange outside his window
<unk> said seeing someone taking the time to clear off the finish line was something that made him proud to be a <unk>
in my heart of hearts i thought
boston strong i love this city and love that someone would do that
after the mystery man was identified as chris <unk> a boston bartender people began calling him an american hero
it's very special to me and to the city and i didn't think it deserved to be covered under all that snow <unk> told cnn affiliate <unk>
this good deed shows how brightly the <unk> spirit still shines <unk> said almost two years after the boston marathon attack
the second photo shows a man with his back to the camera working to clear a section of the mostly covered finish line
the photographer <unk> <unk> posted on instagram that she was searching for the finish line when a man shoveling the sidewalk offered to clear the section of street
i do not know the man shoveling she wrote
he saw me looking for the finish line while he was shoveling the sidewalk
he knew exactly what i was looking for and came over to help me
such a great person with some boston spirit during the blizzard
i wish i knew his name
a third photo shows a person posing at a cleared off finish line with the caption <unk> off the finish line
instagram user <unk> later tweeted to a reporter that he did not have any part in clearing the finish line
a twitter campaign <unk> quickly caught on
a boston police department tweet and facebook post asking for information about the mystery <unk> quickly went viral
boston officer rachel mcguire told cnn that she was calling <unk> a <unk> <unk> and randomly came across the photo of him shoveling while browsing twitter

to utter that sharapova is the underdog saturday is like saying roger federer is a decent player
world no
one williams leads the second ranked sharapova sixteen two in their rivalry but has won fifteen matches in a row
during that streak she has conceded three sets to the russian
if that's not enough williams has never lost a semifinal or final in melbourne her record improving to eleven zero after topping fellow american madison keys seven six six two thursday in the semifinals
sharapova meanwhile has failed to win a major outside roland garros in seven years
but all the imposing statistics don't appear to be <unk> the ever <unk> sharapova who last downed williams at the year end championships in two thousand and four
i think my confidence should be pretty high going into a final of a grand slam no matter who i'm facing and whether i've had a terrible record against someone it doesn't matter sharapova a six three six two winner over compatriot <unk> makarova thursday told reporters
i got there for a reason
i belong in that spot
i will do everything i can to get the title
some would say too that sharapova has fate on her side
she was almost knocked out in the second round needing to save a pair of match points against qualifier alexandra panova
and only last year li na took advantage of her second chance in melbourne fending off a match point in the third round before going on to capture a second grand slam title a week later
since the second round sharapova hasn't come close to dropping a set
everyone's going to expect me to win but maria is playing unbelievable williams was quoted as saying by the <unk> website
she was almost out of the tournament and came back and she's playing better in every single match
she has nothing to lose once again williams later told reporters
she has only things to gain
and i feel that way too
i've won this tournament several times
i don't have to go out there and have another title
i want it but it's not life or death for me
i think that helps me relax
so yeah she absolutely has nothing to lose and i have nothing to lose so it will be fun
williams is chasing a nineteen th grand slam title which would separate the thirty three year old from retired legends <unk> <unk> and chris <unk>
she ultimately had too much game and experience for the nineteen year old keys who made her debut in a grand slam semifinal after eliminating williams older sister venus in her maiden grand slam quarterfinal wednesday
the big hitting keys continuing to play with tape on her injured left thigh broke for an early lead in the first set
once williams settled though she was rarely troubled on serve
it took a little longer than anticipated for williams to finally oust keys with the teenager saving eight match points
i was a little frustrated at the end williams said
i had so many match points and just couldn't close it out and that doesn't usually happen
but in retrospect she was playing very well
she served so well
i'm a really big fan of hers
she's so awesome so positive just a great player
not only did williams defeat keys but she later got a chance to meet one of her favorite singers kenny rogers
<unk> win over makarova who was appearing in a second straight grand slam semifinal wasn't as dramatic although the five time grand slam champion did let a three zero first set advantage fade
the turning point came when makarova was broken at three four in the opening set
the night match on rod laver arena on thursday saw two time grand slam winner andy murray beat two thousand and ten wimbledon finalist tomas berdych six seven six zero six three seven five to reach the men's final

end of the road for rafa
the truth is the single most important thing congress can do to meaningfully improve our border security is pass comprehensive immigration reform
too often border security is viewed as preventing the illegal entry of people and goods across state lines
however border security also is about ensuring the safe efficient flow of commerce and increasing international trade
comprehensive reform will do both while our current approach serves neither objective
i say this as someone who has made countless trips to the u.s. mexico border
i've seen firsthand how our current approach to policing the border is based on <unk> objectives and <unk> benchmarks that mask failure
our failure to secure the border is not for a lack of trying
congress has passed at least four laws since one thousand nine hundred and eighty six authorizing increases in border patrol personnel
in one thousand nine hundred and eighty there were two thousand two hundred and sixty eight border patrol agents at the southwest border
under president obama that number grew to an all time high of twenty one thousand seven hundred and thirty
there was fourteen miles of <unk> on the border in one thousand nine hundred and <unk> under this administration we've erected nearly six hundred and fifty one miles of new <unk> and dramatically increased our mobile surveillance capabilities
yet there is scant evidence that we can spend our way out of this problem
recent studies by princeton university and the university of california at san diego reach <unk> conclusions about our ability to stop illegal border crossings
we have been able to stop only about thirty percents of those attempting to cross our border between one thousand nine hundred and ninety six and two thousand and nine according to the studies
simply spending more money and adding more agents will not secure the border but it will complicate trade
nations can not seek maximum security without <unk> trade but nations can not have fully open borders if they want real security
we can build more fences identify more tracks and inspect more vehicles but only if we are prepared to greatly diminish the free flow of commerce
our nation has wisely opted for a balanced approach
the central reason we will not be more effective at achieving our national security border goals is because u.s. policy since the one thousand nine hundred and eighty s effectively treats all border incursions as equal threats to the homeland
this <unk> our ability to prevent true threats such as drug cartels human traffickers and potential terrorists from flooding the zone and gaining passage into the homeland
these criminals know that a small percentage of their goods and vehicles will be inspected and seized
for them this is the cost of doing business
unless we begin to prioritize threats and facilitate the legitimate entry of validated economic migrants the cost benefit analysis will remain in their favor
border security professionals tell me the vast majority of illegal <unk> are mexicans seeking temporary work in the united states
all illegal crossings undermine border integrity but temporary work seeking migrants do not pose a significant national security threat to the homeland
the best way to strengthen border security without <unk> trade is for congress to establish a system whereby migrant workers can apply for validated biometric entry keys to cross our border safely and legally
this will free up our border security cadre to focus on preventing cartels traffickers and terrorists from exploiting holes in our current system
furthermore <unk> economic migrants to efficient legal crossings will reduce threats to their own safety improve human dignity and give <unk> operators the bandwidth to respond to a higher percentage of <unk> incursions across our nearly two thousand mile border with mexico
we need a new risk based approach informed by intelligence and emphasizing information sharing and international cooperation
fortunately there is a precedent that offers great hope
the transportation security administration's trusted traveler <unk> program is a model of risk based screening that is increasing our security and facilitating commerce
the tsa approach allows approved <unk> travelers to establish they are not security threats and move more <unk> to <unk> international business
this allows tsa officers to focus their attention on more <unk> threats to aviation security
this risk based approach is better for the traveling public and provides more security at less cost
we can adopt a similar approach to our land border with mexico if the congress acts
as a nation we do not accept a system where more than half of terror plots will be successful
we prioritize threats and go after terror cells with zeal
we need to embrace the same strategic approach to border security and abandon a system that does not adequately distinguish between worker crossings and true dangers to u.s. security
by normalizing the process for work seeking migrants to legally enter the country we will legalize a critical segment of our labor force and empower security professionals to focus on the true risks to our homeland
this will be good for our economy and our security
now is the time for congress to act
those are the new details released by the indonesia's national transportation safety committee in a news conference thursday
though it's common for the co pilot to be in control of the aircraft significant questions still linger over the crash of the airasia jet
why did the plane start a sudden steep ascent
was bad weather a factor
qz eight thousand five hundred and one crashed december twenty eight as it flew from the indonesian city of surabaya toward singapore
there were one hundred and sixty two people on board
the plane was in good condition and entire crew were all certified said mardjono siswosuwarno the chief investigator for the transportation committee
the flight took off and <unk> at thirty two thousand feet amid stormy weather
about eleven twelve p.m. <unk> the pilot asked the control tower whether it could ascend to thirty eight thousand feet according to the committee
the plane was veering left and <unk> said <unk> <unk> <unk> a senior pilot and investigator with the committee
qz eight thousand five hundred and one then ascended from its cruising altitude to thirty seven thousand four hundred feet in about thirty seconds in a steep ascent said mardjono
commercial planes are not designed to ascend so quickly analysts have said
it may have been climbing at a rate twice as fast as it could and should one analyst told cnn
the stall warnings which <unk> the words stall stall went on as the plane started the steep climb and continued until it crashed according to information on the flight data recorder
the voice warning doesn't always mean the aircraft has stalled said mardjono
the warning can be triggered when the angle of attack which is the angle at which the wing tackles the <unk> wind hits eight degrees
the plane dropped quickly falling to twenty four thousand feet out of radar detection
air traffic control permitted the plane to ascend to thirty four thousand feet about four minutes after the pilot's initial request
officials have said that the aircraft climbed rapidly before it fell into the water
last week indonesian transportation minister ignasius jonan said the airasia jet stalled after its sudden ascent
investigators have submitted their preliminary report into the crash officials said
but <unk> <unk> the chief of the national transportation safety committee said they would not release the preliminary report during a thursday news briefing
why was airasia jet the only one in trouble
it's unclear whether or when the initial report will be released fully to the public
while the preliminary report presents facts officials indicated there isn't enough verification yet
the french co pilot remi emmanuel plesel had less experience than the captain
plesel forty six had two thousand two hundred and seventy five hours with airasia indonesia compared with the captain known only as <unk> who had six thousand one hundred hours on airasia on the airbus three hundred and twenty
<unk> had more than twenty thousand flying hours under his belt having worked for another airline in indonesia for thirteen years before that and had been a indonesian air force pilot for a decade prior
but it's common for the co pilot to be in control of the aircraft
they usually rotate back and forth said david soucie a cnn aviation expert
and that's a matter of maintaining experience
you wouldn't want one pilot to get all the flight time and the others not to be current on what's going on
indonesian aviation investigators are trying to establish why flight eight thousand five hundred and one went down in an area of heavy thunderstorms last month while other planes nearby completed their journeys safely
authorities have recovered seventy two bodies from the sea with ninety still unaccounted for according to airasia
at least that's what the federal aviation administration wants
the faa released a fifteen second video on youtube wednesday reminding everyone that the super bowl is a no drone zone
the video features pictures of football fans <unk> and cheering in the stands with a <unk> <unk> people don't spoil the game by bringing drones
it ends with the hashtag <unk>
on super bowl sunday the faa will establish a virtual no fly zone around the university of phoenix stadium in <unk> arizona where super bowl xlix will be played
unmanned aircraft such as drones won't be allowed within thirty miles of the stadium from an hour before game time until well after the game is over according to an faa statement
michael steinbach the fbi's assistant director of counterterrorism said super bowl security is a huge task
the super bowl like any large public event the fbi starts planning along with local law enforcement authorities on the ground and dhs months and months beforehand he said
the uptick in the use of drones adds one more wrinkle to security planners jobs
but according to steinbach it's the fbi's job to focus on stopping the threat as opposed to trying to react to specific tools terrorists may use
i'm concerned about drones i'm concerned about guns i'm concerned about bombs cars that's just the tool
i'm more concerned about the actor i'm more concerned about the threat
the faa is waging an education campaign on drone safety after several incidents of drones getting too close to commercial aircraft
faa administrator michael huerta has said pilots have reported up to twenty five cases per month of drones flying above the regulated limit of four hundred feet with some flying as high as two thousand feet in the air
huerta said the faa is working to educate people about the dangers of flying drones that high because enforcement of rules on the small unmanned aerial vehicles can be difficult
drones are sparking security concerns as well
earlier this week a government employee crashed his drone on the grounds of the white house
president barack obama and the first lady weren't at home at the time
no one was injured and the secret service is investigating
i'm fed up with listening to <unk> in the media who talk about the decline of print i just don't believe that to be true says ink co founder michael keating
i think inflight magazines actually buck that trend
inflight magazine <unk> he says is rising not just because passenger numbers are increasing five percents year on year but because the formula is simple and effective
a long flight a captive audience and the fact that people don't just do one thing on a plane
some people might say that with devices and inflight entertainment why would people read the magazine
keating says
but actually they have always read the magazine
whether you're at home or sitting in a captive situation in an aircraft you'll reach forward and read the magazine you'll watch a film you'll have a glass of wine or sleep you'll basically do all of the above
ink has <unk> that belief into an inflight magazine empire that now stands <unk> among inflight publishers
the company currently creates thirty six magazines for twenty six airlines and its products reach six hundred and seventy seven million people a year globally
in the last two years it's been on an acquisitions binge picking up coveted titles from american airlines united airlines <unk> norwegian and hong kong express among others

chasing <unk> revenue through events apps and new media is all a part of <unk> inflight empire

<unk> ad sales teams show just how far in flight magazines have come in two short decades
from <unk> and expensive in house publications often driven by marketing departments with little experience in print media to slick ad driven <unk> with a growing fan base in the air and thanks to their digital versions on land too
its acquisition last year of american way published in house by american airlines group for forty six years is a case in point
one of america's best known and the industry's first inflight magazine ink global feels it has gained control over a slice of america's cultural <unk>
the fact that its <unk> cover this month features <unk> fighters leader dave <unk> also shows the kind of access and star appeal it can command
robert de <unk> on the cover of united airlines business class title <unk> is the kind of premium content that ink is chasing and having little difficulty in <unk> down
on american airlines alone ink global reaches as many as five hundred thousand people a day
we are incredibly proud keating says
it's our twenty th year in business so it's a very proud moment in our company's history to win this account
is now the biggest airline in the world carrying two hundred million passengers a year
with a <unk> of thirty seven thousand letters a year american <unk> audience engagement would be the envy of many national titles
not everyone is as <unk> on the inflight market as ink
<unk> have to compete with a range media in the first place it seems <unk> to me to say that as more people are using the internet on their phones or are able to connect inflight to the internet on their computers that i'll buy a bunch of print magazines says michael sebastian a new york based media reporter at ad age
american way for example saw its ad pages decline twenty four percents last year he adds
that's a pretty steep decline
print media is getting squeezed on all sides
advertisers are shifting their print budgets to digital
they have less to spend on print media
in more ways than one however the <unk> pocket has proved a better distribution vehicle than the newsstands and the information gleaned from online bookings has helped ink create one of the most sought after rate cards in the industry
chasing high end luxury brand advertisers has also lifted titles that once <unk> on cheap <unk> ads to boost revenues
according to data from germany's largest market research institute <unk> inflight magazines hold three of the top six magazine audiences
keating says the sheer <unk> of a <unk> of people from demographic information such as age and gender to <unk> information like destinations and the date of the flight has made for a strong business model for its targeted advertising
<unk> ads now appear on everything from print at home boarding passes and email booking <unk> to airline mobile apps
while it hasn't always been blue skies for ink keating admits that <unk> decision to remove its <unk> pockets had been difficult for the publishing group he says its continuing success is <unk> on challenging outdated notions of what an inflight magazine should be
we changed the business model to a large degree he says

the suitcase was found wednesday afternoon on eleven th street in the mission district
police closed four blocks while they investigated
the los angeles times reported that remains were also found at three locations within a three block radius
asked about the reporting a police spokeswoman told cnn there are no updates
there were other items around the suitcase <unk> said
the gender and age of the person were unclear she said
according to the california department of public health website fifty two of those cases are linked to an outbreak at disneyland
there are four confirmed cases in riverside county where the desert sands unified school district told sixty six students who have either not been vaccinated for measles or can't show proof that they need to stay home
cnn affiliate <unk> reported that one student at palm desert high school is suspected of having had measles
the student has been cleared to return to class but health officials are still trying to determine if the student actually had measles
for now the others will have to study at their homes
they are going to be asked to stay home until the incubation period for contagion is complete a spokeswoman for the school district mary perry said of the students who were released
the earliest a student can return without proof of vaccination is february nine the station reported
there are sixteen cases linked to disneyland outside california
arizona officials said they have identified one thousand contacts of the seven cases in their states
they're asking anyone within that group to isolate themselves for twenty one days if he or she isn't vaccinated
the disease outbreak became apparent when visitors reported coming down with measles after visiting the park from december fifteen to december twenty
at least five disney employees have been diagnosed with measles disney said
also the families of one hundred and ninety five children in mesa arizona have been contacted because they were in an urgent care clinic with someone who has measles
measles is a highly communicable respiratory disease caused by a virus and spread through the air according to the centers for disease control and prevention
measles starts with a fever runny nose cough red eyes and sore throat the cdc said
five things to know about measles
but snoring can be more than just an <unk> to anyone else in the room
it can be a symptom of a serious health condition and has been linked to dangers like heart disease
dailyburn
how much sleep do you really need
of course there are many reasons why people snore and not all of them are chronic or hazardous to your health
if you sleep alone you may not even be aware that you're sawing logs on a regular basis
here's how to know whether you or a loved one is at risk for snoring related health problems and what you can do about it
middle of the night wheezing <unk> and <unk> can happen for a variety of reasons but they all have to do with obstruction of a person's airways
most often muscles in the roof of the mouth or the back of the throat relax and partially block the flow of air
dailyburn
ten reasons you're exhausted and what to do about it
if you blow air through a <unk> tube it's going to <unk> and make noise explains michael grandner phd professor of psychiatry and a member of the center for sleep and circadian <unk> at the university of <unk> <unk> school of medicine
and at night for a lot of people your airways become a <unk> tube
this can occur when people sleep on their backs instead of their sides when they've had a few drinks before bed or when they have nasal congestion due to allergies or a cold
in fact about half of adults snore at least some of the time says grandner and it's usually not dangerous
most of the time we can still get enough air to keep things functioning normally
dailyburn
how bad is booze really
six crazy facts about drinking alcohol
but other snoring triggers can be harder to fix
for example having an enlarged <unk> a large tongue or being overweight especially for men since they tend to gain weight around their necks all raise your risk for <unk> sleep apnea a condition in which the heart isn't able to get enough oxygen to function properly
between five percents and fifteen percents of middle aged adults probably suffer from sleep apnea grandner says although it often goes <unk> and untreated
and that's bad news since studies have shown strong associations between sleep apnea and high blood pressure high cholesterol heart attacks and other cardiovascular conditions
for people with sleep apnea airway obstruction is so severe that breathing slows to a trickle
it may even stop for seconds at a time
these episodes are called <unk> at which point the brain sends alert signals to the body forcing a gasp a gag or an extra powerful snore
a lot of people think sleep apnea will cause them to <unk> but it won't says grandner
you're still getting enough air to breathe and if not your brain will wake you up
the bigger risk he says is the long term damage it can do
fluctuating oxygen levels throughout the night causes stress and oxidative damage to cells within your body
they also force the brain to be on high alert all night and to deliver a shot of adrenaline to the heart every time an apnea occurs when the body and brain are ideally supposed to be resting and recovering
it's much more of a cardiovascular problem than a respiratory one he says
people with untreated sleep apnea tend to develop these conditions years before they normally would
when to take snoring seriously
so how do you know whether you have run of the mill snoring or a more serious problem
if someone hears you sleep on a regular basis and notices that you periodically stop breathing for several seconds at a time that's a red flag
so is the volume of your snoring
if you can hear it pretty clearly through a closed door that's a sign that your body is probably working too hard to get sufficient oxygen says grandner
if you don't have a live in partner or roommate you can still watch out for daytime symptoms
because the condition doesn't allow people to get the deep sleep they need about two <unk> of people with sleep apnea experience excessive daytime <unk>
if you can stop whatever you doing just about any place and any time of day and sit down and immediately fall asleep that's a problem says grandner
waking up feeling exhausted is also a sign especially if that feeling doesn't go away within ten to fifteen minutes of getting out of bed
people with untreated sleep apnea may also have trouble getting high blood pressure under control even with the help of medication
the good news is that sleep apnea is very treatable and easily diagnosed through an overnight sleep study done either in your home or at a sleep clinic
lifestyle changes such as losing weight or not sleeping on your back may help some people
and if not almost all cases can be treated by using a device called a continuous positive air pressure or cpap machine
the device sends air through a tube and a mask into a patient's nose and mouth while they sleep keeping the airway open
it may take a few weeks of getting used to but once they get over that hurdle most patients say it literally changes their life says grandner
it gives them more energy during the day so a lot of them are finally able to exercise eat better and really get healthier overall
first there was the phony claim that saudi television had blurred the first lady's image in its transmission of the obamas condolence call on the kingdom
then came the <unk> over her outfit
was she insensitive in not wearing a headscarf
should she had worn black
then finally we heard the questions about whether she committed an etiquette no no when she shook hands with the new saudi monarch king salman
none of these accusations and claims amount to much on their own
but there is a reason a very good reason why social media turned its attention sharply toward michelle obama in saudi arabia
the presence of an american first lady on saudi territory embodies the intense unease that surrounds u.s. and western relations with the saudi kingdom
saudi <unk> can be the most hospitable people in the world and they are friends of the united states
but all is not well with the relationship
the spectacle of american and european leaders <unk> praising and courting the saudi royals is a most unsettling one
u.s. saudi relations present a profound moral dilemma for america
they constitute a classic example of the tough choices a nation faces when its ideals clash with its interests
the united states wants to have good relations with saudi arabia not only because it has a lot of oil but because it is one of the most powerful countries in the middle east and the two countries share many strategic goals
the u.s. needs saudi arabia and saudi arabia needs the u.s
at the same time many of saudi arabia's practices stand in direct violation of america's and the world's most cherished values
values or interests
that is the question
let's now put an end to the discussion about michelle obama
she did absolutely nothing wrong
in fact the claim that her attire and performance created a firestorm in saudi arabia is <unk> false
by some counts there were some one thousand five hundred tweets with the arabic hashtag which means roughly michelle obama unveiled
that is hardly a <unk> considering that saudi arabia has more than five million twitter users
second the first lady followed protocol
saudi law does not require foreign visitors to wear a hijab the muslim headscarf
this was no protocol breach and it was also not an unusually courageous move on her part
countless prominent women have appeared in public meeting saudi royals without wearing headscarves
we've seen hillary clinton laura bush angela merkel among others visit the kingdom in western attire
finally that handshake
the king would not have shaken hands with michelle obama if he had not wanted to do so
in fact we saw an endless parade of dignitaries shake the president's hand and walk right past the first lady bluntly <unk> ignoring her
that is a breach of etiquette
but it was not committed by the first lady or by king salman
so it looks like this is the scandal that wasn't
a non <unk> if you will
but there was a <unk>
the story made headlines because people in the united states and in the west feel a scandal in the relationship because much of what goes on in saudi arabia is an <unk> not just to western principles but to human rights conventions endorsed by most of the world
and some of the most egregious violations of those values are perpetrated against saudi women
for decades saudi women have protested the <unk> rule that bans them from driving making saudi arabia the only country in the world with such a ban
a saudi woman is required to have a male relative as a guardian who must approve her travel and other key decisions in her life
saudi women are required to wear the abaya a head to toe cover and many wear a niqab which covers the face
the fact that they dress differently is not in itself a rights violation but the fact that they have no choice in the matter is
saudi women who are intelligent strong competent mature capable of making decision for themselves as well as any saudi man are treated in many cases as if they were children
but it's not just women whose rights as defined by international standards are violated
there is no freedom of religion in the kingdom where everyone by law must be a muslim and the public practice of other religions is forbidden
and freedom of expression is severely restricted
blogger raif badawi who sought to promote a discussion about social and religious issues on his website was sentenced to one thousand lashes for insulting islam and showing disobedience
he suffered the first fifty lashes a few weeks ago and the international outcry combined with the toll it took on his health led the government to put the rest of the sentence on hold
then there are the public beheadings after questionable legal proceedings
already sixteen people have been beheaded this year
there were eighty seven such punishments last year
so what is the united states to do
cooperation with saudi arabia is crucial in restoring stability to the middle east in fighting isis and other terrorist groups in keeping oil prices low to pressure iran and russia and in a number of other high priority items on the world's agenda
the answer is a frustrating balance of realism and <unk>
the answer requires acknowledging in private and in public as hillary clinton has done that we find some of their practices unacceptable along with an open and unapologetic defense of the principles of equality and basic freedoms
the united states can not <unk> relations with riyadh and the truth is that it can not force the saudis to change but keeping quiet on the matter is an <unk> capitulation
a condolence call was not the time for public criticism and michelle obama's presence in riyadh was a meaningful sign that the united states believes women belong in the public sphere
the scandal was a sign of the frustration people feel with this ethical dilemma
a man a government intelligence agency employee no less took to the top of his g street building late at night to show off his drone to a female companion
he had been drinking
it crashed
on the white house grounds
at least that's the story that's emerged from the latest details revealed by law enforcement regarding the incident that occurred on monday
read
obama says we need more drone regulations
according to the secret service in the early hours of monday morning a two foot wide recreational quadcopter took off from a neighborhood about ten blocks east of the white house and flew over the president's residence before crashing on the southeast side of the complex
the secret service locked down the white house shortly after three a.m. after an officer on the south grounds spotted the drone flying at a very low altitude
president barack obama and the first lady are both away traveling in india
the man who was flying the drone self reported his involvement in the incident and said he was using it for recreational purposes the secret service told cnn
the man who works for the national geospatial intelligence agency a government entity with mapping and national security duties was operating it from either his building's balcony or roof when he lost control and saw it head down g street secret service sources told cnn's peter morris
another source close to the investigation told cnn's pamela brown he was demonstrating the drone to a woman who was also in the apartment
sources told cnn that in the secret service interview the man said he was drinking when he flew the drone

spy drone operator was drinking
the company that manufactures the drone that crashed on white house grounds announced on wednesday that it will move to disable its drones from flying in much of washington
the chinese company <unk> dji technology co. ltd. will be releasing a <unk> update in the next few days that prevents dji drones from flying into restricted areas like those over the white house and capitol hill
this is in accordance with federal aviation administration rules that already exist that restrict flight over d.c. so we're just releasing software that more clearly follows these rules company spokesman michael perry told cnn
we are in the process of testing it right now should be able to release it in the next few days
while it will be up to the customers to install the update perry said it is a mandatory update meaning future <unk> will require the new version of the software
deputy white house press secretary eric schultz said on wednesday the white house has full confidence in the ability of the secret service to secure the safety and security of the grounds
this technology is not new to the secret service
this is something they've been working through for some time and so they also are constantly reviewing emerging technologies
this is no different schultz said
obama in an interview with cnn's fareed zakaria on tuesday said the incident highlights the need for stronger regulations surrounding the use of drones
i've actually asked the faa and a number of agencies to examine how we are managing this new technology because the drone that landed in the white house you buy in radio shack
the <unk> confirmed in a statement issued on tuesday one of its employees was the operator of the drone
the employee was off duty and the drone flight was not work related according to the statement
in a brief phone conversation the operator declined to comment when pressed on whether he was intoxicated while flying the drone
i can't really speak right now
i hope you understand he told cnn's jim <unk>
as the incident comes into focus it calls into question how much responsibility drone manufacturers should place in the hands of their customers
dji's michael perry told cnn that his company is leading the way when it comes to putting in place safety restrictions
after the incident this week it was important to demonstrate responsibility demonstrate that we are keeping the skies safe and open for innovations perry said
we want to provide tools that make sure people are flying in accordance with the existing rules and flying processes on their first flight perry said
we also want to make sure the product becomes more popular and more widespread
perry explained that with the update if a drone tries to lift off in a restricted area its motors won't even turn on
if a drone is outside a restricted area gps data will send an alert that it is nearing restricted air space and it will automatically activate a return to home feature
before the drone can take off it marks where home is so that if the drone loses connection with the operator it will rise to fifty one hundred feet and then head towards home
an operator must maintain line of sight with the drone in order to operate it
if it flies more than six hundred feet out of the line of sight it will lose that connection
the drone <unk> with the operator through radio transmissions so <unk> like trees and buildings can interrupt the connection
this raises questions about how far away the operator of monday morning's drone was from the white house and how far it could have traveled before losing connection
secret service sources have floated the idea that the drone could have been traveling down g street when it lost connection with the operator and attempted to return home before getting stuck on the white house grounds
like any computer system there is the possibility of this new software being hacked and modified but perry claims it would be difficult
opinion
could drones be used against the u.s.
our system is pretty unique
we don't allow programmers to access the flight controller he told cnn
it would take a lot of hacking
according to perry they already have software in place that stops drones from flying in restricted airspace near airports
the company will also release an update that prevents drones from crossing national borders following an incident where a <unk> drone flying from mexico crash landed just south of the u.s. border in a failed drug delivery on january twenty three
as investigators look into the incident it is still unclear exactly what path the drone followed
but perry says that the information is stored within the flight controller and could be accessed if the customer explicitly requests it
perry said that as of wednesday afternoon no law enforcement agency had been in touch about the case
if presented with a subpoena or warrant we would work together with law enforcement in accordance with what information we are legally able to share with them he said
since that threat authorities have received more than fifty threats made online against airlines
the official says most of the incidents are believed to be copycat incidents
none of the threats have proven credible
the official as well as other government officials cnn spoke with on wednesday point to the publicity these threats receive for the increase
we are continuing to investigate these threats with our law enforcement and airline partners as we do with all stated threats an fbi spokesman told cnn on wednesday
threats of this nature can and do result in costly responses from a multitude of law enforcement and airport entities and greatly inconvenience travelers
individuals responsible can be prosecuted federally
on jan. seventeen f sixteen fighter jets were called in to escort two passenger planes into atlanta's hartsfield jackson international airport after a bomb threat made on twitter was deemed credible according to military officials
southwest airlines flight two thousand four hundred and ninety two and delta flight one thousand one hundred and fifty six landed safely at the airport and were searched by bomb disposal units according to airline officials
nothing out of the ordinary was found officials said
one runway was closed temporarily causing delays for other flights as passengers on the two flights were questioned and their luggage was searched by bomb sniffing dogs officials said
exploding kittens the card game dreamed up by video game designers elan lee and shane small and illustrated by the oatmeal's matthew inman is now the most backed campaign in kickstarter history in terms of the number of backers according to the crowdfunding platform
the card game has raised more than four million dollar since its january twenty launch far exceeding the initial ten thousand dollar goal
kickstarter spokesman david gallagher confirmed the game which has everything from magical <unk> to cats that can kill you had set a record for the most individual donors
more than one hundred and eight thousand individuals have pledged as of tuesday evening
that's more backers than the crowd pleasing reboot of veronica mars return of reading rainbow or the coolest cooler in the twenty one st century received in their individual campaigns
the fundraising campaign still has twenty two days to go before it's officially over
luke crane <unk> community manager for games says the success of exploding kittens is a combination of the oatmeal's online popularity elan <unk> great reputation in the games world and <unk> own game loving community
they love being a part of making something new
and they've pledged a total of three hundred and five million dollar to games projects since kickstarter first launched crane said
we knew it would be successful given the people involved but we had no idea it would get this big
in an interview with cnn wednesday elan lee described exploding kittens as a strategic kitty powered version of russian <unk> that gets more intense as users play the game because there's a greater chance of drawing an exploding kitten card
in its blog post the exploding kittens team says the success of its fundraising campaign has nothing to do with money press or fancy graphics and it has everything to do with the people who feel passionately about backing the game
it has everything to do with you
you wonderful people have come together to form the largest community in kickstarter history and the numbers keep rising the creators wrote
the community is also helping to improve on the game lee said
commenters on the kickstarter page flagged their concern about left handed accessibility when it comes to <unk> out cards
now the exploding kittens team is looking into how to make the game easy to use for right and left handed people
lee estimates card decks will start being shipped by july
we pushed away everything to focus on our core promise that you send us twenty dollar and we'll send you the game he said
initially lee planned on printing one thousand decks of exploding kittens and got an estimate that it would cost ten thousand dollar
that was the original amount on the exploding kittens kickstarter page
but when the pledges soared into the millions lee shared the kickstarter page with his printer because he wasn't sure how many orders they could fill
the printer who also works with the popular kickstarter game cards against humanity was floored
she just started screaming lee said
that's the kind of enthusiasm lee is seeing on exploding kittens kickstarter page
this is an amazing community
this is the place where people are coming together to help build this game
these one hundred and eight thousand people will tell us what they love and what they were concerned about he said
the it security expert was one of the last to see nisman alive
nisman was found dead in his apartment days after filing a report accusing the country's top leaders of covering up iran's involvement in argentina's worst terrorist attack
it looked like a suicide but now even the government has doubts that is the truth
so when lagomarsino decided to address reporters on wednesday it should have been an unequivocally <unk> event
but like so much of the information surrounding nisman's mysterious death seeds of doubt had already been planted
in addition to being an assistant to nisman lagomarsino is the one who gave the prosecutor the gun that ended his life and is the only person charged in connection with his death
lagomarsino faces up to six years in prison if convicted of providing nisman with the gun
with this hanging over his head lagomarsino broke his silence saying that he committed no crime and that he let nisman borrow the gun at the prosecutor's insistence
nisman was fearful about his safety after he filed his report in court and was <unk> of even the security guards that were assigned to protect him lagomarsino said
the prosecutor had called lagomarsino who had become a family friend through the it work he did for them before dawn on january seventeen
nisman asked him to come over to his apartment immediately lagomarsino said
lagomarsino recalls seeing documents <unk> out on a table and an anxious nisman spilling his fears
the prosecutor was worried about repercussions for the accusations he <unk> against the government
he alleged that president cristina fernandez de kirchner and foreign minister hector timerman among others conspired to cover up iran's involvement in the one thousand nine hundred and ninety four bombing of a jewish community center in buenos aires in exchange for a friendly trade deal
in the days after he filed the complaint in court nisman didn't even venture out to buy groceries
he had his mother do that for him lagomarsino said
i am more afraid of being right than being wrong the it engineer remembers nisman telling him that morning
he was afraid that his daughters were in danger nisman told lagomarsino
the prosecutor said he didn't trust his security guards and asked lagomarsino if he had a gun he could borrow
lagomarsino went back home and thought about the request
when nisman called again insisting that he bring the weapon over
according to lagomarsino nisman claimed he would not use the gun and only wanted to have it in his glove box in case of an emergency
so lagomarsino returned to nisman's apartment handed him the weapon and then left
he texted nisman later that afternoon to check in on him
nisman who had been investigating the one thousand nine hundred and ninety four bombing of the argentine israelite mutual association that killed eighty five people died from a gunshot wound to the head
the gun that lagomarsino had given him was near the body along with a shell casing
his body was found on january eighteen the day after his conversation with lagomarsino and the day before he was to testify before lawmakers about his allegations
an autopsy was performed the next day
president fernandez was quick to call it a suicide but changed her story a few days later
a test found no gunpowder residue on nisman's hands as would have been expected if he had pulled the trigger
on wednesday nisman's body was returned to his family after his ex wife declined to have additional tests conducted on the body the state run telam news agency reported
the prosecutor's funeral is scheduled for thursday
even before nisman died <unk> government vehemently denied that it had covered up anything relating to the one thousand nine hundred and ninety four bombing
the government's cabinet chief has said that nisman was <unk> by information from antonio jaime <unk> a former argentine intelligence chief
<unk> was ousted from the intelligence agency in december
government officials have <unk> that rogue intelligence agents misled nisman to attack fernandez and then killed him when they no longer needed him
many of the small details in the case fuel the conspiracy fire
in the days after nisman's body was found state media published what it described as a social media message from nisman to friends explaining that he had to cut a vacation to spain short so he could return to argentina and file the report against the president
on wednesday the prosecutor investigating nisman's death <unk> fein told reporters that there is no evidence that nisman suddenly changed his plans
records show that his return from spain had been planned weeks before
there have also been reports linking lagomarsino to the former intelligence agent <unk>
the it man's lawyer denied that the two knew each other
the quake was centered about twenty five miles southwest of the town of <unk> california
it was two hundred and four miles northwest of <unk>
jay <unk> the city manager of <unk> said it was a gentle yet fairly significant earthquake
it was a rolling event he said
not jerky he added
lt. wayne <unk> of the <unk> county sheriff's office who was in his office on the bottom floor of the courthouse in nearby <unk> said it was nothing out of the ordinary
he estimated the quake to have lasted five to ten seconds
both <unk> and <unk> said there were no immediate reports of injuries or damage
based on initial information the national tsunami warning center said on its website that it didn't expect a tsunami to be generated by the earthquake
it was a sizable earthquake but not large enough to cause concern david walsh an <unk> in hawaii with the pacific tsunami warning center said
a magnitude five point seven quake is considered strong enough to be felt by everyone in the affected area and could do some damage to buildings the <unk> said on its website
one person felt the quake about three hundred miles away in san jose julie <unk> of the <unk> said
there were at least two <unk> one was a magnitude three point three in the area the <unk> said
technology executive don pyle
his wife sandra
and four grandchildren died in what bureau of alcohol tobacco firearms and explosives agent bill <unk> called a tragic accident that occurred at the worst possible time while the <unk> and their grandchildren were sleeping
the involvement of the christmas tree explains the heavy fire conditions fire chief <unk> graves said at a news conference
the grandchildren have been identified as alexis boone eight
<unk> boone seven
charlotte boone eight and <unk> boone six
they were the children of sandra <unk> sons randy and clint boone
while the explanation that has been shared with us today does not bring solace it does start us down the long road to acceptance a statement wednesday from the boone and pyle families said
our tragedy has touched many lives in many families and in different degrees is shared by each of us
our hope is that our loss will raise awareness that this tragic event could happen to any family
the blaze started in the waterfront <unk> great room with nineteen foot <unk> and connections to living and sleeping areas
it was fed by a towering christmas tree that was cut about two months earlier fire officials said
the tree was lit most of the time officials said
the fuel load from the christmas tree itself is what created the significant amount of fire and heat to cause the fire to spread as quickly as it did deputy chief scott <unk> said
authorities were alerted within minutes by a fire alarm system monitored outside the home and a <unk> nine hundred and eleven call
the home which was constructed before two thousand and five legislation requiring a <unk> system did not have the devices
we're very comfortable that this was an accidental fire graves said
the medical examiner's office positively identified the victims officials said
five bodies were recovered in the days after the fire
the final one on monday
the children were visiting their grandparents for a <unk> because january nineteen was a school holiday a family spokeswoman said
we believe that life is about making memories
as we work through our pain and loss the memories we made with our family will sustain us the families statement said
officials said they were still conducting tests to determine the exact sequence of events but believe the fire was sparked by a faulty electrical outlet
smoke detectors in homes are common but fire <unk> are not says the federal emergency management agency
fire <unk> reduce the death rate by eighty three percents property damage by sixty nine percents and firefighter injuries by sixty five percents
fires in homes are responsible for more than eighty percents of fire deaths in the united states according to the agency
christmas tree fires are three times more deadly than home fire in general according to the national fire protection association
local and federal officials last week secured the structure and accessed the foundation of the sixteen thousand square foot house
<unk> dogs led them to the bodies officials said
authorities were initially treating the house as a crime scene
officials said it is standard procedure for a case such as this and no evidence has been found to indicate suspicious activity
the house belonged to pyle chief operating officer for <unk> and his wife sandra company spokesman antonio <unk> said
the sheer size of the structure and the fact that three <unk> of the building had collapsed into the basement with deep piles of debris still <unk> days after the blaze compounded the search anne <unk> county fire capt
robert <unk> said
he led the investigation along with a team from the federal bureau of alcohol tobacco firearms and explosives
you're looking at five standard houses put together he said last week
this is more of a commercial fire than it is a residential fire
there are a lot of businesses that aren't sixteen thousand square feet
that adds to it
fire officials said they were alerted to the fire about three thirty a.m. january nineteen
about eighty firefighters responded
the <unk> national response team responded because the fire was deemed suspicious <unk> said
the fire department said crews had difficulty putting out the fire because the house is <unk> apparently with no fire <unk> on the scene
photos the fire department posted on twitter showed <unk> stretched for long distances
davies said it took hours for fire department <unk> trucks and a fire boat on an adjacent creek to bring the fire under control
<unk> company biography described him as an industry veteran who has held multiple ceo positions with more than twenty five years experience in information technology infrastructure software and hardware management
livia isn't sick but doctors fear she might become the fifty three rd person to contract measles in a recent disneyland outbreak
now she's in a twenty eight day quarantine because of a family that refused to vaccinate their child
it started january two when the simons took livia who had a cold to the pediatrician
two days later the doctor's office called to say that a child with measles had been in the office that same day
one of the most contagious viruses on earth measles can hang in the air or on surfaces for hours
if she'd contracted the disease livia could become deaf or even die
we were really freaking out and really worried jennifer simon said
then the simons learned from a doctor that the child in the doctor's office had contracted measles because his parents had refused vaccination
livia just six months old is too young to be vaccinated
i'm angry simon said
i've been upset that someone else's personal choice has impacted us so much
in <unk> county where simon lives nine infants were in quarantine as of tuesday night because of the measles outbreak a spokeswoman said
simon said she hopes families who opt not to <unk> their children realize the full impact of their decision
their choice endangered my child she said
she points out that vaccine <unk> rely on other people to protect their children
it's called herd immunity
if the rest of the community is immune to disease it helps keep the disease from spreading to those who are unvaccinated
you're basically relying on society but not giving back she said
a happy baby she doesn't seem to mind being at home but it's disrupted the simons life and cost them money as the couple had to miss work for several days and then bring <unk> mother in from houston to stay home with livia
when asked what she would say to parents of the unvaccinated child she said she would first ask whether their child was doing ok
then she would ask them a question
hey you guys what do you think about vaccines now

the two teams drew one one in <unk> and can not be separated by their head to head records goal difference or goals scored
instead a random draw will decide which team goes through to play ghana on sunday
all four teams could have faced the drawing of lots had there been no winners from the group's final two games
the last time lots were drawn at the cup of nations was in one thousand nine hundred and eighty eight when algeria went through at the expense of ivory coast
in <unk> max <unk> goal ensured the elephants did not suffer the same fate this year
the saint <unk> forward guided ivory coast past cameroon with a twenty yard first half strike that <unk> goalkeeper <unk> <unk>
cameroon coach <unk> <unk> criticized for his selection of <unk> players at the tournament threw on <unk> striker clinton <unk> in a bid to <unk> control of the game
but ivory coast should have had a second through wilfried bony and go through as group winners to face algeria in the last eight perhaps to the frustration of premier league managers with stars like bony <unk> toure <unk> toure and <unk> <unk> still wrapped up in the cup
algeria now represents one of the <unk> toughest tests for a generation of ivory coast players who have failed to deliver a major trophy despite their promise coming only as close as the final of the two thousand and twelve cup of nations final in two thousand and twelve where they lost to zambia
guinea and mali will become the first teams to draw lots at the cup of nations for twenty seven years after a game dominated by back to back penalties
kevin constant <unk> home from the spot to put guinea ahead in the fifteen th minute after <unk> <unk> coulibaly had headed the ball onto his own hand
mali could have been level instantly as referee mohamed said <unk> immediately awarded a second penalty at the other end but <unk> <unk> tame effort was easily saved

the forty two year old a man of formidable football <unk> confirmed to cnn in an exclusive interview on wednesday he wants to replace sepp blatter as president of world soccer's governing body
after growing weary at fifa's increasingly <unk> reputation he's asked supporters the world over to follow his crusade to <unk> an organization he says has become a <unk> for scandal
the tipping point came towards the end of two thousand and fourteen when fifa opted not to publish a report by u.s. lawyer michael garcia into allegations of corruption during the race to host the two thousand and eighteen and two thousand and twenty two world cups releasing its own summary of his findings instead
i think that was the moment of change and the moment i thought something had to be done figo told cnn anchor alex thomas
if you are transparent and if you ask for an investigation a report which you have nothing to hide why don't you make public that report
if you have nothing to hide about that you have to do it
having decided to run and with a trophy laden career to bolster his credibility figo now must convince the majority of fifa's two hundred and nine member associations that he means business
the former portugal captain has made transparency a key <unk> of his pitch for soccer's top job <unk> that a change in leadership and governance is the only way to revitalize fifa's reputation
he also vowed to release more of fifa's vast financial reserves to its federations in the hope of boosting the sport at grass roots level
and he gave short <unk> to any suggestion that his candidacy was a publicity stunt an accusation leveled at former france international david ginola who recently launched his bid alongside a bookmaker and confirmed he was being paid for his involvement
i don't need to be a candidate to get publicity
i had a fantastic career and i'm very proud of so many years playing at a high level explained figo
i'm not getting paid
fortunately i have a situation that allows me to pay for my <unk> and i'm lucky that i can pay my travels and support my expenses
i think the organization is right now not a football organization it is more a political organization he added referring to fifa
we have to care about the future of football try to restore the leadership the governance and big transparency and solidarity with the federations
figo does not want for style or substance but his decision to take aim at blatter is a gamble
the seventy eight year old has been <unk> in fifa's corridors of power since one thousand nine hundred and ninety eight and still enjoys firm support among its member associations despite the increasingly <unk> nature of his rein
many commentators see <unk> election as a <unk> conclusion but even if figo is the only candidate to make his way onto the ballot paper it will still represent progress from two thousand and <unk> ballot
back then <unk> former fifa member mohamed bin hammam withdrew from the race after he was suspended on bribery charges leaving blatter to run <unk>
figo joins a list of presidential hopefuls that includes ginola independent candidate jerome champagne asian football confederation vice president prince ali and michael van praag the head of dutch football
of those names it is arguably only figo who has the potential to loosen blatter's stranglehold on fifa's top job
i can say i'm a real candidate after today and i'm looking forward to opening the debate and trying to get the support of many federations to have the chance to be the president added figo
i think to take this step you have to be prepared
of course i did my homework but i have a lot of things that i have to learn to improve but if your mind is open i think it's much more easy
i have my ideas about what is football and what is good for improving fifa but i think my experience of my career is a positive thing that allows me to understand a lot of the game
my first priority is to know from the federations what they need
i think one important thing is to increase the solidarity payments to the federations because right now fifa has so many financial reserves that belong to the federations
<unk> <unk> and at times controversial career began with sporting <unk> in portugal before he moved to spanish giants barcelona in one thousand nine hundred and ninety five quickly establishing himself as one of its best players
alongside an all star cast that included brazilian pair <unk> and ronaldo as well as dutch striker patrick <unk> figo was part of the <unk> team that won back to back la liga titles in one thousand nine hundred and ninety eight and one thousand nine hundred and ninety nine
he also won five cup competitions in <unk> including the uefa cup winners cup and the uefa super cup in one thousand nine hundred and ninety seven
by this time figo had established himself as one of the finest players in the world and one who was <unk> by the club's fans
so when it was announced he was leaving to join <unk> biggest rival real madrid it was seen as not just a <unk> of the club but the whole region
then barcelona president joan <unk> reacted to news that real had activated <unk> thirty seven point five million buyout clause by vowing
i won't forget this
someone who does this to me will pay for it
figo was denounced as a money <unk> and was afforded a <unk> reception on his first visit to <unk> <unk> camp stadium with his new club though it would intensify in the two thousand and three season as coins bottles and even a <unk> head was thrown at him by a <unk> home support
but his <unk> to the <unk> helped real re establish themselves as spain's pre eminent force as they won the la liga title in two thousand and one going on to secure a prized european champions league crown the following season
his signing kick started <unk> <unk> brand with stellar names such as <unk> <unk> ronaldo and david beckham also acquired
by the time figo left for inter milan in two thousand and five he had collected seven trophies the same amount he won at <unk>
in italy figo won four successive <unk> a titles one italian cup and three italian super cups before retiring in two thousand and nine
figo also represented his national team with distinction becoming the country's most capped player with one hundred and twenty seven appearances
portugal made the semifinals of euro two thousand and went out of the two thousand and two world cup at the group stage before suffering a heart breaking shock defeat to greece in the final of euro two thousand and four which it hosted
he retired from international football at the two thousand and six world cup after he <unk> his side to the semifinals where it was beaten by france
the race to become president
<unk> declaration means there are now five potential challengers to blatter's throne but two important hurdles must be overcome before any of them can officially join the race
first they need to prove an active role in association football for two of the five years <unk> his proposed <unk> then demonstrate they've got the backing of five of fifa's two hundred and nine member associations
jerome champagne an independent french candidate was the first to declare his bid back in september but revealed earlier this month he was struggling to attract five nominations
prince ali who has been the president of jordanian football since one thousand nine hundred and ninety nine announced his intention to stand on january six but has said very little publicly about his campaign
it remains to be seen whether he can muster five backers but blatter's stranglehold on power was underlined when the asian football confederation confirmed its intention to support him instead of prince ali who is its vice president
ginola a former player with french champions paris saint <unk> and english premier league sides tottenham and newcastle launched his bid in london on january sixteen saying it was time to reboot football
but his charge was immediately undermined by the revelation that his bid was being backed by bookmaker paddy power who has a self confessed penchant for <unk> and that he was being paid two hundred and fifty thousand for his involvement
ginola's prospective bid is reliant on crowdfunding to help him through to <unk> elections but so far it has only raised six thousand three hundred
doubts also remain as to whether he'll be able to find five associations to support him
van praag who has been head of dutch football since two thousand and eight entered the fray earlier this week vowing to normalize and modernize fifa
the sixty six year old was critical of blatter when the swiss backtracked on his decision to stand down after his current term as president ended and is confident he has already secured five nominations
as part of his <unk> van praag is reportedly ready to offer blatter an advisory role if the dutchman is elected fifa president
the deadline for applications was on thursday but it might be next week before fifa announces who has made their way onto the ballot paper for the election held in zurich on may twenty nine
cnn's human to hero series celebrates inspiration and achievement in sport
click here for times videos and features
france's <unk> fernandez may not be a household name outside his sport but his achievements on court put even those of his <unk> <unk> compatriot thierry henry in the shade
with more than three hundred and seventy five international caps and a goal tally for france nearing one thousand five hundred fernandez has been a <unk> for both country and his various clubs in a career spanning almost two decades
during spells with sides in france spain and germany fernandez has won numerous club titles including the champions league the <unk> equivalent of football's premier european club competition
but it is on the international stage where fernandez has made his most enduring impact winning three world and european titles and olympic gold medals at the last two games in beijing two thousand and eight and london in two thousand and twelve
the best memory in my career and for my sport was the olympics games in beijing because it was a title that changed the view of people in france about handball fernandez told cnn's human to hero series
now it's famous but before we only saw football or basketball on tv
now is one of the best sports in france
when a twenty year old fernandez arrived on the international scene in one thousand nine hundred and ninety seven france was beginning to emerge as a major force in handball
a bronze medal at the barcelona olympics in one thousand nine hundred and ninety two was followed by the country's first world championship gold medal three years later
the solid foundations were rapidly built on as france assembled a series of world beating teams which has in turn helped fuel <unk> growing popularity among the french public
handball might not rival the participation levels of football or tennis the former has around two million licensed players in france the latter just over one million but the sport has seen numbers rise steadily in recent years with participation up by almost a third france's ministry of sport estimated there were just under half a million registered players in two thousand and twelve
played on courts measuring forty x twenty meters handball teams are made up of seven players one goalkeeper and six <unk> with seven substitutes who can replace another player at any time during a game
a match lasts one hour and games are often combative and fast paced with lots of goals around one a minute on average
if you want to play a contact sport with team spirit you must play handball because i think it's one of the most complete sports in the world fernandez says
it's like rugby or american football it's very physical but very tactical too
you need to be fit and play collectively as a team
with sudden changes in <unk> and end to end action there is much to keep crowds entertained but it is goals that gets handball crowds going
the jump shot which sees a player leap before unleashing the ball at speeds up to one hundred and twenty five kph is a spectacular climax to a long drawn out tactical build up and fernandez is one of the game's greatest <unk> says german handball journalist <unk> pazen
he looks a little bit skinny compared to other players but he has the power in his arms and he can jump pazen explains
he is famous for jumping over the defence players to score
at six foot six inches tall fernandez can leap higher than most but in handball circles much like basketball he is no giant the sport attracts its fair share of seven <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> currently one of the <unk> biggest attractions
while fernandez's prolific <unk> might grab the headlines it is his intelligence and leadership that have made the thirty seven year old one of the top ten players of all time says pazen who has watched the <unk> career develop over the past fourteen years
usually you get injured when you get hit really hard but he was always clever enough to make moves that nobody expected
you know he's a very intelligent player in a very intelligent team he says
when he comes in in crucial matches like finals everybody knows they can count on him he scores the goals or makes the crucial pass so that others can score
he is a leader but he's also a team player
it came as no surprise that fernandez took over as national captain in two thousand and nine and soon led france to their third world title beating perennial rivals croatia twenty four nineteen in the final in <unk> in february that year
this was a career highlight
it was my first competition as captain for me it was the most important he says
fernandez and france are currently on course to be crowned world champions for a fifth time at the world championships currently taking place in qatar pazen says they are big favorites at the <unk> tournament
<unk> a fourth world title would be deeply satisfying for fernandez but not as rewarding as attending a fifth consecutive olympics and the chance to equal another record in what would be his <unk> in the sport
his big dream is to go to rio to play and win the olympic gold for a third time pazen says
only russian goalkeeper <unk> lavrov has won three olympic gold medals in one thousand nine hundred and eighty eight one thousand nine hundred and ninety two and two thousand
if he does travel to brazil pazen sees no reason why france would not pick him if he is fit then he has every chance of finishing his career on a golden high
but whatever happens in months ahead it looks like he'll never be too far away from the court in the years to come
i'm thinking about becoming a coach
all that i have learned in my career i want to give to the young players so they can reach for titles with the clubs and the national team
for me it is normal to help players
handball is my sport my passion and i want to give back

nor will its attempts to export terror to europe
but <unk> anyone declare victory predictions of isis demise are wildly optimistic
isis still controls some fifty thousand square kilometers of iraq as well as up to thirty percents of syrian territory and at least ten percents of its population
to the west of baghdad it is still on the offensive in anbar and recently raided checkpoints on the iraqi saudi border
pentagon spokesman rear admiral john kirby said last week
we're only six to seven months into this thing
this is going to be a long struggle
a senior official at the u.s. state department echoed <unk> line this week saying isis <unk> from kobani is part of the early phase of a multi year campaign
isis is a very adaptive organization the official said and terms like turning point were to be avoided
even so there's quite a contrast between september when u.s. officials said the fall of kobani to isis seemed inevitable and kurds celebrating on the city's streets this week
isis chose kobani as a symbol of its <unk> even sending hostage john <unk> there to make a video about the group's inevitable victory
kobani was a recruitment poster in isis efforts to draw more foreign fighters to the caliphate
isis continued to reinforce its presence in the town despite constant airstrikes
general john allen u.s. coordinator of the campaign against isis said in november that the group had <unk> itself on kobani
the state department official said isis losses there likely running into four figures could help counter the messaging that has attracted foreign fighters
a narrative of inevitable glory and <unk> had been replaced by images of bodies left on the streets the official said
a growing number of those foreign fighters may also be disillusioned after several months of airstrikes
setbacks in kobani and elsewhere have led to a stream of <unk> dozens of whom have been executed according to local activists cited by the syrian observatory on human rights
analysts say one trend in coming months may be a stream of disillusioned foreigners trying to escape isis territory
in iraq a leading expert on isis <unk> al <unk> told cnn that isis has now lost ground in several areas and needs to regroup
<unk> soltvedt a senior analyst at consultancy <unk> <unk> agrees that isis is on the back foot in iraq relying more on classic insurgency tactics such as roadside bombs and unable to move in force because of the threat of airstrikes
among its latest reverses isis has lost control over a number of villages in the province of diyala north east of baghdad
iraqi troops and shia militia known as popular mobilization units launched an offensive last week to retake isis last strongholds around <unk> fifty miles from the capital
according to iraqi commanders the whole province of diyala is now back in government hands after several months of intermittent battles
soltvedt says it became increasingly difficult for isis to sustain its supply lines in the region
the key prize for all sides in iraq remains mosul a city of one point five million people on the <unk> river held by isis since last june
isis has invested heavily in governing the city
its leader abu bakr al baghdadi pronounced his leadership of the caliphate at the grand mosque there last july
for their part kurdish officials say that as long as isis holds mosul it threatens kurdistan
likewise neither the government in baghdad nor its coalition partners can rest while terrorists occupy iraq's second largest city
peshmerga forces have made steady progress against isis north and west of mosul over the last two months
they have taken some three thousand square kilometers of the sinjar area as well as the area around the mosul dam choking off access routes and threatening isis main resupply route to syria
to the south iraqi forces gains around <unk> have also restricted isis freedom of movement
the institute for the study of war which studies military activity in iraq and syria says isis is preparing to dig a defensive trench around mosul and has blown up a bridge on a key western approach
<unk> also reports an increase in executions by isis across <unk> province where mosul is located which it sees as further evidence isis is feeling pressured by internal resistance in the province
there had been talk of a january offensive to retake mosul but any assault now seems many weeks away
kirby told cnn's barbara starr tuesday that the timing could not be predicted but obviously we're working closely with iraqi security forces on helping them better understand the challenges of an assault on mosul
iraqi units are already fully occupied elsewhere notably in anbar province where isis threatens ramadi and other areas
an assault on mosul would have to be <unk> co <unk> from several different directions informed by good intelligence and supported from the air
a massive intelligence gathering effort is already under way according to analysts
even so <unk> remaining residents are predominantly sunni arabs and would be wary of kurdish and shia militia so regular forces from the <unk> iraqi army would likely have to take the lead
the recent history of urban warfare in iraq should give pause analysts say recalling the brutal battles to <unk> al qaeda from fallujah in two thousand and four
soltvedt says an uprising from within is much <unk> to an assault from without and some observers predict any operation to retake mosul wouldn't happen until early summer
another problem for isis is that coalition airstrikes and ground operations by iraqi and peshmerga forces appear to be <unk> away isis commanders even if claims by some us officials that half of isis leadership has been taken out appear optimistic
among prominent casualties reported by iraqi and kurdish officials in the past two months are isis governor for anbar province abu anas <unk> and abu muslim al <unk> a member of isis shura council its highest policy making body
soltvedt says some of isis most seasoned fighters have also left iraq some returning to libya for example
more importantly he says there is only a finite pool of skilled military commanders some of them former officers in saddam <unk> army and they will have a problem replacing them if they are killed
even where isis suffers defeat there is no guarantee the iraqi government can secure and hold territory
the prominent role of shia militia may yet make it difficult for baghdad to <unk> areas after isis retreats
during the diyala offensive the militia killed some seventy sunni civilians a local member of parliament <unk> al <unk> told reuters
others claimed the militia had burned down houses and mosques
the iraqi interior ministry denied the claims but it's not the first time these militia have been accused of atrocities during military offensives and that may weaken the readiness of sunni tribes to help the government against isis
the iraqi government has proposed bringing the militia under the umbrella of a national guard
oil minister adel abdul <unk> wrote on his facebook page that it would be possible to organize the shia popular mobilization forces the sunni sons of iraq and the peshmerga under the umbrella of the national guard knowing that the main goal of the latter is to prevent the emergence of militias put all the weapons under the supervision of the state and provide backup forces when needed
but there is plenty of resistance to the idea because such militia have often been the best guarantee of a community's security
in areas it <unk> the iraqi government will have to provide security rehabilitation and effective governance to people who with good reason don't believe baghdad can provide any of the above
isis also benefits from being able to use both syrian and iraqi territory as the battlefield shifts
while under pressure in northern iraq its forces can regroup across the border in syria's <unk> province
it can also use the frontier from <unk> <unk> into iraq's anbar province where it enjoys real strategic depth and the iraqi army struggles with long supply lines says soltvedt
it has even begun to probe the iraqi saudi border
isis also controls a number of small oil fields and an arsenal of weaponry captured in both iraq and syria
and it still has money
iraqi finance minister <unk> <unk> told reuters he estimates isis has looted four hundred and fifty six million dollar from banks in mosul <unk> and <unk> since june
and it has set up a rudimentary taxation system in the main cities it controls as well as a fearsome intelligence apparatus
but isis is finding the job of controlling much harder than that of attacking
it has needed an expensive and labor intensive mix of coercion intimidation and policing to run mosul where the iraqi government still pays the bulk of state employees salaries
under pressure on several fronts isis now has to think very carefully about where it puts its forces says soltvedt

french president franois hollande may have enjoyed a miraculous boost in the polls he may pace on the deck of an aircraft carrier with a strange bush like swagger amid the chorus of sacred national union but he won't bend the course of world history because of an attack on his territory
still he looks at france now and finds matters of tremendous reflections along with some similarities
coping with anger is one of them
in the ten days after september eleven three innocent men were killed in arizona texas and california just because they looked muslim in the eyes of the shooters
one was a <unk> store owner who was targeted because he wore a <unk>
france has had no murders but saw more anti muslim attacks ranging from insults to <unk> of mosques in the rest of the country from january seven twenty than in all of france in two thousand and fourteen
then there's the institutional furor
i remember vividly in two thousand and one the cases of muslim foreigners deported for <unk> reasons such as mere accusations of having made anti american statements not even related to terrorism in reported private conversations
some were jailed in secret on the most outlandish suspicions
a pakistani man with heart disease locked up under the <unk> of his <unk> a <unk> visa died alone in a new jersey cell of a heart attack
others were forgotten behind bars for months
the <unk> french may have criticized america's hysteria at the time but they have little to brag about lately
a week after the charlie hebdo attack more than fifty individuals had already been charged and ten of them sentenced to prison terms for the crime of <unk> to terrorism
one of them is a man arrested for driving under the influence who got a fourteen month sentence due in part to his previous arrests after mentioning the fate of the three police officers killed
another is a man with psychiatric problems who received three months for his rants even though the prosecution itself recognized his place was less in prison than in a treatment facility
french comic <unk> accused of anti semitism which he denies but convicted nine times for <unk> racial hatred and similar charges will be judged by an anti terror court for his apparent <unk> on facebook of amedy coulibaly the killer at the kosher store in east paris

neither seem to be six other people sent to prison one of them for two years for their ugly posts on social network in accordance with the same law originally aimed at jihadist <unk> on the internet
after september eleven americans <unk> having been too kind in the prevention of terrorism and many commentators urge paris not to fall into the trap of its own patriot act
but the french have long had a set of anti terror laws that have been the envy of america's police and intelligence departments
attacks by opposition politicians stating that the legal hurdles of france's soft on crime and socialist government which they claim prevented phone taps of the terrorists are a joke
our police let the terrorists off the hook this summer for a number of reasons
firstly they had nothing on them but petty violations of counterfeit laws
secondly they had plenty of other fish to fry namely five thousand other potential french jihadists whose tracking would demand a minimum of ten detectives per suspect
there's also the fact that more than nine hundred people have left france to join the ranks of isis in iraq and syria a <unk> number
america discovered in two thousand and one the extent of the hate brewing in the muslim world through the acts of nineteen killers some of whom had spent more than a year in their country
france has to look inward which may be even more painful and <unk> the three children of the republic born and raised in its civilization
and it does
one of the first moves by the government was to grant citizenship in a week after the supermarket attack to the young muslim employee an immigrant from mali who had hidden captives during the siege at the kosher store
the second was for prime minister manuel valls who <unk> from spain as a child to <unk> the apartheid france's muslim population suffers
the word may be shocking but it <unk> officially for once the long known reality of our ghettos the failure of integration in france and the <unk> of our school system
racism
france had and still has its share of <unk> <unk> and <unk> of the worst <unk>
but this shows more simply what american liberals would call a lack of sensitivity an <unk> being such a diverse society to accept that the cultural rules of the white male majority may not be entirely <unk> or accessible by other members of the population
<unk> denied in the name of the rejection of american style political correctness is an example
race and culture barriers are another manifestation of this orchestrated blindness
at a moment when ghettos promote the surge of religious devotion as a remedy to the denial of <unk> the gap is getting even wider and the rage more dangerous in the eyes of the most violent of the <unk> and hopeless
the so called <unk> the official secularism of the french republic bears a deep responsibility
the concept has always been a political <unk> an offshoot of anti <unk> that justified even in part the denial of the right to vote for women until one thousand nine hundred and forty five out of fear their <unk> to the catholic church would endanger the republic
it has later for too long been directed at the most different and disadvantaged immigrant population from the maghreb region
a glorious <unk> of the denial of differences one which let <unk> and injustice <unk> for decades prevented any affirmative action or simple recognition of diversity
long before september eleven bill clinton speaking of race and class relations said that there is nothing bad in america that can not be solved with what is good in america
the same must be true in france as the horror of january makes us look at the truth about our country
for two weeks boko haram gunmen have sacked dozens of villages in michika district close to the border with cameroon slaughtering male residents and abducting others said <unk> kamale a lawmaker representing michika district in the adamawa state house of assembly
they move house to house killing people including the old abducting women and children and burning homes kamale said tuesday
he said villages are littered with bodies and there is no one to bury them because residents have fled thousands of them heading off into the mountains or across the border into cameroon to escape the onslaught
they slaughter people like animals he said
now seventy percents of the people in the district have been <unk> from the homes
some of them have run into the mountains while others have crossed into cameroon or fled to <unk> the capital of adamawa state kamale said
the villagers ordeal is horrific but sadly nothing new for boko haram
the terrorist group its name translating as western education is sin has been a force in nigeria for years
it tries to use religion to justify its actions which are aimed at imposing its strict version of of sharia law in nigeria which is split between a majority muslim north and a mostly christian south
boko haram has intensified its attacks in recent years standing defiant against the nigerian military
and it hasn't gone after only government troops or officials with civilians often becoming victims
the group has been tied to a spate of assassinations market bombings attacks on churches and <unk> mosques and raids of villages including those earlier this month in michika district
mass kidnappings have also been part of its playbook most notoriously the taking of more than two hundred schoolgirls from chibok last april
boys and young men have been abducted as well including forty between the ages of ten and twenty three reportedly taken captive on new year's eve in borno state and ninety seven others kidnapped in and around the village of doron baga in august
and whether or not they were former captives boko haram may be boasting about its use of child soldiers in its fight
an organization calling itself boko haram's official <unk> this week even promoted an alleged military training camp for children on its twitter feed posting images of children in formation holding ak forty seven weapons
while cnn can not independently verify the authenticity of the photos intelligence sources said the images appear to be real and are consistent with the islamist extremist group's strategy of forcibly recruiting and training children
and the u.s. state department lent credibility to the report by tweeting a photo of the young heavily armed children along with these words
amid its massacres of innocents boko haram running training camps for child soldiers
the release of these photos and the new twitter account appear to coincide with an ever more sophisticated media strategy on the part of boko haram
the change in tactics appears to emulate isis even down to the use of islamic chants or <unk>
last week a video was posted on the same account purporting to be an interview with boko haram's spokesman
both the interviewer and the subject were masked and the production values were far more sophisticated than anything the terror group has published before
boko haram's campaign has left thousands of nigerians in danger in some cases with the central government and others seemingly unable to help
the latest bloodshed began in michika township which boko haram took over in september and declared to be part of its caliphate
the insurgents then moved into villages including <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> kamale <unk> <unk> and <unk>
humanitarian workers have been unable to reach residents who fled into the mountains said mohammed <unk> head of the national emergency management agency for northeast nigeria
we are aware there are people trapped in the mountains but they are inaccessible
the security situation is a challenge in reaching them and offering them humanitarian assistance <unk> said
kamale said the military has not responded to complaints that he and other community leaders lodged calling for its intervention
sometimes we alert the military when they are advancing on villages before they attack but no action is taken to stop them he said
these insurgents have been killing with impunity
when they attack a village they will sleep there for the night after the slaughter and move on the next morning the lawmaker said
there has been no reaction from the military to <unk> specific allegation
amnesty international on wednesday leveled a similar accusation saying it had evidence that the nigerian military was warned repeatedly about impending boko haram attacks on civilians late last year on <unk> and monguno
these attacks are an urgent wake up call for the nigerian leadership the african union and the international community said <unk> <unk> <unk>
it is essential to protect hundreds of thousands of civilians in northeast nigeria from boko haram's continued onslaught
the nigerian defense ministry responded by calling the allegation misleading saying that <unk> use of these unfortunate activities of terrorists to find fault with the counterterrorism operations as usual is inaccurate and unfair
the defense ministry said its forces have enhanced their intelligence abilities troop deployment and coordination and logistics capabilities
in actual fact the protection of civilian populations is the essence of the entire counterterrorism operation the ministry said
indeed the troops were prepared and <unk> engaged the terrorists in all the instances referred to by amnesty international
the target audience is families and friends of young people at risk of radicalization young people themselves and the wider public according to a government news release
entitled stop jihadism the website opens with a two minute video which borrows the kind of visual codes normally employed by cyber jihadists
violent images sometimes punctuated by an isis flag on a facebook page
then a message from a recruiter pops up written in french slang
hi
cool stuff that you like does it interest you what is happening in the levant at the moment
if you have questions don't hesitate the truth is over there it is now that we must leave
if you want more information give me your number i have friends there that fight i will put you in contact
then the video <unk> point by point common arguments used by cyber <unk>
each point is underlined on the screen by images of violence and suffering
after the video users are directed to the <unk> homepage where they can find out more about the terrorist threat the government's response how to <unk> jihadist propaganda and how french people can join together against the threat
a toll free number for prevention of radicalization is provided for families and friends who notice alarming signals such as a sudden change of dietary habits or the rejection of family members
the platform is not a gadget it's not just cosmetic
it is really essential to establish this link between families relatives and public authorities to ensure they are listened to but also that there is a response says interior ministry <unk> pierre henry <unk> in one of the videos featured on the website
in others radicalization experts explain the mechanisms of jihadist propaganda and what can be done to prevent it from <unk> new recruits
the website points out that more than four hundred french people are currently in iraq and syria
the young people who've been <unk> by terrorists promoting a corrupt version of islam come from all backgrounds and areas of france it says
more than seventy french citizens or residents of france are already dead from having fallen into their trap it says
the website is a response to concern that the paris attacks carried out by three french citizens could be followed by others as disaffected young people are recruited to the cause of radical islam by skilled online <unk>
france like other european nations including belgium and britain is also concerned about the threat posed by jihadists returning home from syria or iraq and seeking to carry out attacks on their native soil
terrorism expert and journalist david <unk> told le figaro newspaper he doubted that this kind of government <unk> would have any impact on young would be jihadists
however it may have positive effects on the awareness of families who can then understand better what is going on and call the famous anti jihad toll free number <unk> said
thanks for inviting us from cnn to madrid
what have you got to tell us
well today is important because i will present my candidacy for the president of fifa
big big announcement what made you decide to want to try to become the next fifa president
the important thing is the love of football
i care about football so what i am seeing regarding the image of fifa not only now but in the past years i don't like it
i've been talking with so many people
important people in football football players managers presidents of federation all these things they have to be done
last year was a world cup year and i was in brazil and i saw the reaction of the fans regarding the image of fifa
i think something had to be changed
a change in leadership change in governance in transparency and in solidarity so i think it is the moment for that
you say you don't like what people have been saying to you about fifa's image
what have they been telling you
well all the people have the idea that a world organization like fifa an organization that has the power to and the image of football for the world must be different
if you search right now fifa you know on the internet or communications
you see the first words that comes out are scandal not positive words regarding the name of fifa
so instead we have to change first and try to improve the nature of fifa in the world because football deserves much better than this
to get to the election you need to be nominated by five national associations and you need to show that you've worked in football for two of the last five years
have you got those criteria
well i know well the criteria for the candidate of the presidency of fifa
in the past years i have been working in several roles in inter milan in portuguese national team in uefa and i have the five letters of support from the different kind of national teams so i can say i am real candidate
after today i'm looking forward to opening debate and to run for the presidency and try to have the support of federations and have the chance to be president
are you able to tell us which five associations have backed you
one is probably obvious
well i think in the right moment this is going to be public
i'm going to preserve that confidentiality right now
tell us more about your work since retiring as a player an amazing twenty year career
since two thousand and nine what has your work in football involved
since i retired i started to work with inter milan for international relations
i was in that position for four years and after the regulation the changing of the new president in the club so i left and began working for the portuguese national team and uefa and commenting on football so i'm pretty happy with what i made since i retired
but i care about football and i care about what is going on right now and fifa has made me do this step so i'm trying to do some positive steps
being fifa president is probably more complicated than it looks
are you ready to learn all the technical rules and regulations that you need to
well i know that
i think if you give this step you have to be prepared
of course i've done my homework but i have a lot of things that i have to learn and to improve
of course i have my ideas about football what is good for playing and for fifa right now
but i think my experience of my career my own life is a positive thing that allows me to understand how is the game and of course i need to know from the federations what they expect and what they want for the future of football
so you're announcing today that you're in the running to be fifa president but how long have you been thinking about it
was there one moment that made you think i have to run
well i've been thinking regarding this possibility a few months been talking of course with my family with the people who are close to me a lot of agents in football players managers a lot of people
there was a moment after it became public that fifa ordered to investigate by doing some report about what was happening in bids of russia and qatar
after that moment and after that report was not published i think that was the moment of change and the moment that i saw something needed to be done
what made you so annoyed about that moment
when michael garcia had to resign because he thought not enough had been done
well because if you are transparent and if you ask for some investigation for some report if you've got nothing to hide why don't you make public that report
i think that if you have nothing to hide about that if you're very clear you have to do it
so if you were fifa president would you reopen that investigation and make that report public
well if it was the easy thing to do if all the people were doubting about what's happening if it comes from fifa to order that report
after that if you don't publish i think it's not the right decision
and if you were fifa president on your first day in the job what's the number one priority
my first priority is know from the federations what they need but i think one important thing that i have made is to increase the solidarity payments to the federations because right now fifa has so many financial reserves that belong to the federations
and with that kind of solidarity payments i think federations can have the chance to improve all the programs at the grassroots
you're not the first person to announce they want to stand
others have been accused of doing it as publicity stunts
how can you reassure people that you're in this for the right reasons
well i respect all the other candidates
i think i don't need to be a candidate of fifa to get ahead
i had a fantastic career and i am very proud of playing at the highest level for so many years that i don't need to be known to this kind of campaign or this kind of publicity to be running for president
are you getting paid
no i'm not getting paid fortunately i have a situation that allows me to pay for my candidacy
i am lucky that i can pay my travels and support those expenses
you married a swedish model you have three lovely daughters you were world footballer of the year ballon d'or winner won league titles in spain with barcelona and real madrid and italy when you were at inter milan you won the champions league you reached the final of euro two thousand and four why put yourself through this
because i love football i care about football
i think that life is a challenge and if you don't take the step to improve obviously that is not correct
i think if you don't have challenges every day
for me it's about giving back to football so many things that football gives to me through my life
i think that is most important
i think we have to care about the future of football
try to restore the leadership try to restore the governance how the organization is right now being transparent
and we saw that with the federations i think this is the point that make me to give this step
well i think no one is <unk> in this life and if you think like that you're wrong
of course this is a person that is running the organization for so long since one thousand nine hundred and ninety eight and for a lot of people he may be the favorite but i have to hope
i can say that for me it's a fantastic challenge to try to convince people to follow me and to support me
i have so many examples in football that play against the strongest team can play against the <unk> team and you never know who is going to win
sometimes you think that you're going to lose and you win and sometimes you think we're going to win and you lose
that is the beauty of sport
that is the beauty of this challenge
this is harder than being a goal down with five minutes to go isn't it
well it's not easy you have to believe
the impossible is nothing in this life
david was a patriot
david was a warrior when he needed to be and also a <unk> james berry said about his son
he was intelligent and <unk>
he would not break down in a fight when liberty freedom and justice was at stake
i lost a son yesterday but i believe in what david did and i stand proud of him while i privately mourn he told cnn's the lead with jake tapper on wednesday
the libyan branch of isis has claimed responsibility for the gun and bomb attack that killed five foreigners including berry an american security contractor
five libyans also died in tuesday's attack on the corinthia hotel said a spokesman for a security division of the ministry of interior in tripoli <unk> al naas
two attackers were killed he said saying it appeared they were libyans
the five star hotel is known as one where foreigners and government officials stay and meet to conduct business
the libyan branch of isis released photos of the two gunmen it said had carried out the attacks identifying them as abu <unk> al <unk> and abu <unk> al <unk>
their naming convention indicates that the men were of tunisian and sudanese origin respectively
the fbi is expected to open an investigation into the incident two u.s. officials told cnn
according to military records berry was in the u.s. marine corps completing six <unk> in afghanistan kuwait and iraq
he retired in september two thousand and twelve after a dozen years of service
he was working for <unk> a security firm
according to its website the virginia based firm provides high risk environment training and global security solutions to employees of the u.s. government ngos and multinational corporations who live and work in dangerous and <unk> locations worldwide
his father said berry was fluent in arabic and knew his way around the arab world
he knew how to approach arabic people on a foreign shore and not
discriminate against them not come across as i'm am american warrior and i'm going to do it this way
he was very conciliatory in nature james berry said
his son leaves behind a wife and four children
the other foreigners killed in the attack were a french citizen and three people from <unk> al naas said
the french foreign ministry confirmed that a french citizen was among the dead but did not identify the victim
the tripoli government which is not internationally recognized said the intended target of the attack was its prime minister omar al <unk> but the claim has not been confirmed
al naas said that at least two libyan security personnel were killed in the attack
an online group that supports isis said the attack was carried out in the name of abu anas al libi
he was an alleged al qaeda operative accused of involvement in the bombing of u.s. embassies in africa
he was captured by u.s. special forces in tripoli in two thousand and thirteen
he died in a u.s. hospital this month
it's this declared link to al <unk> capture by the united states that has prompted the fbi to investigate
fighters loyal to isis have for several months been in control of the mediterranean port city of <unk> in eastern libya near the border with egypt
they are suspected in other attacks elsewhere in libya including in <unk> al <unk> and tripoli
tuesday's attack began when militants detonated a car bomb in the parking lot of the hotel
the gunmen then shot their way into the hotel
the high rise hotel is popular among government officials some of whom live there
until now it was seen as one of the remaining secure locations in tripoli for diplomatic and government activity
the attack different in scale and coordination to those seen previously even after months of violence in <unk> east sends the message that nowhere in the country or its capital is safe
authorities say they are now in control of the hotel premises and are starting their investigation
the self proclaimed tripoli government formed by a coalition of militias holds sway only over the capital and surrounding areas
the internationally recognized parliament was forced to leave the capital after militia groups seized control of the city in the summer
the u.s. embassy in tripoli the united nations and other international organizations and businesses also evacuated their <unk> from tripoli in the summer due to the unrest
the u.s. state department last week issued a warning advising u.s. citizens against all travel to libya and recommending that any u.s. citizens currently in the north african country should leave immediately
extremist groups in libya have made several specific threats against u.s. government officials citizens and interests in libya it said
because of the presumption that foreigners especially u.s. citizens in libya may be associated with the u.s. government or u.s
non governmental organizations travelers should be aware that they may be targeted for kidnapping violent attacks or death
using powerful optics they have found a much larger planet like body j one thousand four hundred and seven b with rings two hundred times the size of saturn's u.s. and dutch astronomers said
it lies some four hundred light years away from earth
for decades scientists have believed that many moons around large planets formed out of such ring systems
but this is the first one astronomers have observed outside of our solar system they said
it was discovered in two thousand and twelve but a detailed analysis of its data was recently completed and published
if j one thousand four hundred and seven b were in our solar system it would dominate earth's nightly sky
if we could replace saturn's rings with the rings around j one thousand four hundred and seven b they would be easily visible at night and be many times larger than the full moon said matthew <unk> from the netherlands <unk> observatory
unlike galileo <unk> a relatively short distance through his simple telescope today's astronomers can't <unk> the rings hundreds of light years away
but using two very powerful optical devices with eight cameras each they can observe the effect the rings have as they pass across nearby star j one thousand four hundred and seven written without a b at the end
it is similar to our sun
the rings of planet j one thousand four hundred and seven b eclipse its light
with the enormous size of the rings the eclipse the astronomers observed lasted fifty six days
but the star did not go completely dark for nearly two months
some of j one thousand four hundred and seven <unk> thirty rings are denser blocking more light and some of them are less dense letting more light through
and there are gaps between the rings leading the scientists to theorize that <unk> have formed and cut clean orbits through the debris like the moons around saturn
our own solar system's ringed giant has at least sixty moons according to nasa
like its system of rings planet j one thousand four hundred and seven b is also much larger than saturn said astrophysicist eric <unk> whose team at the university of rochester discovered the object
you could think of it as kind of a super saturn
it is called a brown dwarf a size classification somewhere between a planet and a star according to the california institute of technology
brown <unk> are hot but don't burst into nuclear fusion the way stars do so they don't give off light
the scientists are calling on amateur astronomers to keep an eye on star j one thousand four hundred and seven in hopes they may observe the rings <unk> it again and report the results to the american association of variable star observers which collects astronomical data on stars that change in brightness
and astronomers will also search for more such ringed systems

the former real madrid and barcelona star revealed his intention to run against sepp blatter in an exclusive interview with cnn wednesday
the forty two year old is renowned the world over after a distinguished twenty year playing career and arguably counts as the most credible threat yet to blatter's seventeen year stranglehold on soccer's top job
figo was twice voted world player of the year and represented portugal one hundred and twenty seven times featuring at the world cup in two thousand and two and two thousand and six as well as playing in three european championships
i care about football so what i'm seeing regarding the image of fifa not only now but in the past years i don't like it he told alex thomas in madrid
if you search fifa on the internet you see the first word that comes out
scandal not positive words
it's that we have to change first and try to improve the image of fifa
football deserves much better than this
i've been talking with so many important people in football players managers president of federations and they all think that something has to be done
last year was the world cup i was in brazil and i saw the reaction of all the fans regarding the image of fifa and i think something has to be changed
change in leadership governance transparency and solidarity so i think it's the moment for that
figo joins former paris saint <unk> star david ginola independent candidate jerome champagne asian football confederation vice president prince ali and michael van praag the head of dutch football in the running to become president
the deadline for nominations is thursday and figo confirmed to cnn he has secured backing from the five fifa member associations required to get his name onto the ballot paper for <unk> election though he did not name them
his work for inter milan and the portuguese national team also means he <unk> fifa's rule that states all candidates must have played an active role in association football for two of the five years
he has also been working on <unk> football committee
figo said the <unk> over a key report that looked at the bidding process for the two thousand and eighteen world cup awarded to russia and the two thousand and twenty two <unk> given to qatar had convinced him to stand against blatter
soccer's governing body enlisted u.s. lawyer michael garcia to probe claims that former fifa member mohamed bin hammam used a multi million dollar <unk> fund to buy support for the bid charges he and qatar have strenuously denied
garcia quit his role as chairman of the investigatory chamber of the fifa ethics committee after the organization decided not to publish his report instead releasing a summary by german judge hans <unk> eckert its independent ethics <unk>
after that report was not published i think that was the moment of change and the moment i thought that something had to be done figo explained
if you are transparent and if you ask for an investigation a report which you have nothing to hide why don't you make public that report
if you have nothing to hide about that you have to do it
publishing the report is the easy thing to do if all the people is doubting what happened
if it came from fifa to order that report and after that you don't publish it is not a good decision
figo might have the name and the credentials but <unk> blatter could prove his toughest challenge yet
fifa's president had repeatedly said his current term would be his last but had a rethink at the fifa congress in june last year despite the increasingly turbulent nature of his tenure
the seventy eight year old's u turn drew criticism from a number of federations but his power within the organization was underlined recently when the asian football confederation confirmed its intention to support him even after its own vice president prince ali declared his candidacy
but figo maintains he is <unk> by the scale of his task
i think no one is <unk> in this life he said
if you think like that you are wrong
of course blatter is a person that is running the organization for so long since one thousand nine hundred and ninety eight and a lot of people can be the favorite but i can say for me it is a fantastic challenge to try and convince the people to follow me and support me
i have so many examples in football
you can play against the strongest team or you can play against the <unk> team and you never know who will win
sometimes you think you will lose and you win sometimes you think you will win and you lose
that is the beauty of sport
that is the beauty of this running too
it is not easy but you have to believe
<unk> bid drew immediate support from chelsea manager and fellow portuguese jose <unk> who said
<unk> candidacy is a great step forward for football
his career over many years grants a better future for fifa
he will be a president focused on football and its general improvement acting closely with all federations
separately in gaza the united nations said it was outraged when palestinian protesters climbed the perimeter of a u.n. compound and damaged it
u.n. officials took hamas to task for not preventing the incident

the attack took place near shebaa farms also known as <unk> <unk> a disputed strip of land between lebanon and syria <unk> the golan heights under israeli control
seven israeli soldiers were injured two of them moderately the idf said
hezbollah which syrian president bashar al assad's regime supports claimed responsibility for the attack
the spanish service member <unk>
francisco javier <unk> toledo was serving with unifil the u.n. interim force in lebanon
he was killed during the incidents that happened between hezbollah and the israeli military the spanish government said
it was unknown whether the peacekeeper thirty six was killed by israeli or hezbollah fire
the idf told cnn it is investigating
unifil said its personnel observed six rockets launched toward israel on wednesday morning and that the idf returned artillery fire in the same general area
during the course of the developments a unifil peacekeeper deployed at a u.n. position near <unk> sustained serious injuries that resulted in his death
the precise cause of death is as yet <unk> and remains the subject of investigation unifil said in a statement
unifil head of mission and force commander major general <unk> <unk> was in immediate contact with the parties to help control the situation and prevent further escalation
in the meantime at around one thirty p.m. five rockets were fired from the general area of <unk> <unk> toward israel
the idf fired artillery rounds towards the source of fire
unifil has been informed by the idf that they incurred casualties as a result of fire from the lebanese side
an israeli military position on mount <unk> also came under mortar fire wednesday the idf said
israel planned to evacuate civilians wednesday from the town which includes a popular ski resort
a day earlier a rocket attack struck the golan heights and israel responded with artillery fire
overnight the military launched airstrikes against syrian targets in response to hezbollah rocket fire from syrian bases idf spokesman lt. col. peter lerner told cnn
we did this to send a message to the syrian regime that we view it responsible for what occurs on its territory and that there is a price to pay for allowing hezbollah to use your positions lerner said
if the syrians think they are going to open up a new front on the golan after forty years we are not willing to accept that
the golan heights were part of syria until the six day war in one thousand nine hundred and sixty seven
the area has since been under israeli control
israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu warned wednesday that his country is prepared to respond to attacks in the region
at a ceremony in the southern israel city of <unk> netanyahu said at this moment the idf is responding to events in the north
to everyone who is trying to challenge us at the northern border i recommend that they look what happened not far away from the city of <unk> in gaza
hamas took its hardest hit since its formation
and the idf is prepared to act strongly on all fronts
netanyahu convened a security meeting and vowed those who are responsible for this attack will pay the price
he linked the violence to iran which supports hezbollah and the syrian regime
iran has been attempting for some time through hezbollah to create an additional terror front against us from the golan heights
we are working aggressively and responsibly against this attempt he said
the lebanese government and the assad regime are both responsible for the implications of the attacks that are originating from their territory against israel
we must not provide terrorism with a nuclear umbrella
we must not let the most dangerous regime in the world have the most dangerous weapon in the world the office said
u.n. peacekeepers pulled out of the golan heights in september after islamic militants took some peacekeepers hostage and syrian rebel fighters took control of the border crossing between israel and syria in the syrian town of quneitra
there has been intermittent weapons fire from syria into the golan heights both targeted and <unk> the israeli military contends as the syrian civil war has raged
more than a week ago iranian <unk> media reported that an israeli airstrike killed six hezbollah members and a senior iranian commander around quneitra
the israeli military refused to comment about the january eighteen strike
hamas said wednesday it <unk> hezbollah's right to respond to the israeli aggression especially following the attack in quneitra
hezbollah has claimed responsibility for numerous terrorist attacks
it is blamed for a one thousand nine hundred and eighty three bombing that killed two hundred and forty one u.s. service personnel at a marine compound in beirut lebanon the deadliest attack against u.s. marines since the battle of <unk> <unk> in world war ii
hamas meanwhile came under criticism wednesday from the u.n. special coordinator for the middle east peace process robert <unk> who said he was outraged by the assault on a u.n. compound in gaza
during a pre announced demonstration of which hamas was well aware a number of protesters climbed the perimeter wall and entered the compound causing damage to united nations premises and property he said
due to precautionary measures taken united nations personnel working in the compound were fortunately unharmed
hamas controls gaza
pending a full transfer of security responsibilities to the legitimate palestinian authority we continue to hold hamas fully responsible for the security and safety of all united nations personnel and operations in gaza <unk> said

i had already experienced two davos moments in the swiss mountain town
as i entered the congress center i passed facebook <unk> <unk> <unk> and then imf managing director christine lagarde
you can have it all despite what you're reading in all the magazines that you can't cairns told me as i interviewed her for cnn's leading women series
she's just one of many high profile women attending <unk> this year and rejects the notion that working mothers can't have successful careers
davos is a gathering of great minds and change makers from across the globe and its theme this year is the new global context
the focus takes in everything from fighting terror to addressing the growing income divide
but this year just seventeen percents of participants at this invitation only summit are female
an increase on fifteen percents in two thousand and fourteen but still far too small a number
meanwhile on the fortune five hundred list just three point four percents of corporations have female ceos
clearly there is work to do
in two thousand and ten <unk> introduced a new policy allowing corporations to bring a fifth senior leader to the summit as long as both men and women were in the delegation
progress has been made with initiatives like this but the event remains <unk> male
facebook's vp of global marketing carolyn <unk> thinks change will come
she told fortune in the coming years the number of attendees who are women will rise as the conversations that are taking place all around us today are going to fundamentally impact the path for women in the future
based in london ann cairns told me she believes the u.s. is a few years ahead of europe in seeing women rise up the corporate ladder
when it comes to corporate boards she is torn on the question of whether or not there should be <unk>
i think it's a very difficult area because i would like to see more women on boards
i would hate to think i got onto a board because of a <unk> and i think most women would feel that way
is it moving fast enough
i think it could probably move faster
<unk> cousin executive director of the world food program explained why the world food program focuses so much on women
because women make the difference in all the communities that we serve
even in our households women have big voices
cousin runs the five point four billion dollar aid program but the path to her position was filled with hurdles
she recounted an experience in law school when she was given advice on how to <unk> in a job interview
ensure that your client doesn't see you as a woman she was told because that was still seen as a <unk>
it was still seen that if you were a woman you would not have the ability to go into a courtroom and represent a client
that you needed to be <unk>
clearly she didn't take that advice
i went in for a job interview
i wore a red coat dress
because i said if they're going to hire me it won't be because of what i'm wearing and they need to know from the time i sit down in the chair to when i walk in the door that they're hiring a woman
a woman who is capable of performing the work
there's a lot of work game changing work being done by the women here at <unk>
this is a place that <unk> just about everyone because it's hard to digest the caliber of many of the attendees and the magnitude of change for the better they are striving for
there are also remarkable men here focused on women
the youngest of the one thousand five hundred business leaders from over one hundred countries here is twenty two year old alain <unk> from cameroon who has created an app called gifted mom dedicated to the health of pregnant women
it is helping to lower the death rate among <unk> mothers and newborns in his country
<unk> mission statement says it is committed to improving the state of the world through public private cooperation
and as ann cairns tweeted
men and women make truly productive teams
let's hope in the coming years they will also be equal in number

the most inspiring women of the year
benjamin and kristi strack were found dead on their bed on september twenty seven
on the floor near them in the locked master bedroom lay the bodies of three of their children from eleven to fourteen years old
there were no signs of violence but beside each body there were cups with liquid inside
on tuesday police in <unk> revealed the conclusion of their investigation
the parents had committed suicide by taking toxic levels of drugs and had given fatal levels of drugs including the heroin substitute methadone to their younger two children
their fourteen year old son benson also had taken toxic levels of drugs but the manner of death was ruled could not be determined because investigators were unsure whether he was capable of deciding to join his parents in committing suicide
but why would a family do this
according to a statement released by j. scott <unk> chief of police for <unk> the parents had bought into a concern about a pending <unk>
from interviews with friends and relatives of the strack family the statement said it became fairly apparent that the topic of leaving this world was a fairly common theme
it added while some friends thought that suicide may have been or could have been included in their plans others believed they were going to move somewhere and live off the grid
tragically the parents chose the former option police believe and took their children with them
they didn't leave behind many clues to their thinking
investigators found a notebook with the kind of handwritten lists parents write before going on vacation like feeding the pets and asking someone to watch after the house but no suicide notes were uncovered
however one note was found apparently written by benson to a friend which indicated that benson was aware that he may die and was <unk> his personal possessions to his friend the police statement said
this was the only letter or note found that gave any indication that family members knew what may <unk> in the home
it was this note that led investigators to conclude that benson might have known that he was going to die having been heavily influenced by his parents apocalyptic beliefs and could have agreed to the plan
the other two children were obviously too young at ages eleven and twelve to consent to any sort of agreement to commit suicide police said of his sister <unk> strack and brother <unk> strack
this and the fact that their parents must have provided the drugs led police to determine that their deaths were homicide
the medical examiner's report said the drugs that caused the children's deaths were methadone and <unk> a common over the counter <unk> used in such medications as <unk> and <unk>
the autopsy for kristi strack thirty six revealed the cause of death to be drug <unk> with methadone <unk> <unk> and <unk> found in her system
she was receiving methadone treatment police said so she would have known just how toxic this combination of drugs would be
this contributed to their determination of suicide
her husband benjamin strack thirty seven was found to have a toxic level of heroin in his body
investigators say they think he was the last to die his family around him
his arm and leg were <unk> over kristi
he was on top of the bed covers
while the other family members were under bed covers
this would indicate that he was likely the last in the family to succumb to the toxic levels of drugs in his system the statement said
this was the awful scene that confronted another son of kristi strack when he and a girlfriend who'd noticed an eerie quiet in the house got inside the locked bedroom
in an audio recording of the nine hundred and eleven call made from the house also released by police an emotional sounding young woman can be heard saying that the whole family is dead and that they've killed themselves
<unk> expressed his condolences to strack family relatives saying the unexpected nature of the deaths must have intensified their shock and grief
in a case such as this one where this family has lost not one but five family members the deep emotional pain must be incredibly difficult
our hearts and prayers go out to the family his statement said

i encourage my customers when they buy a piece from <unk> eight to actually buy a certain way of looking at the world she explains
a way that encourages you to stick your neck out to be different and to wear a piece of india proudly she adds
last year the thirty seven year old entrepreneur was included in the business of fashion five hundred a list people who are shaping the global fashion industry
she quotes her mother a <unk> designer as a major influence on her style and life
she taught me that fashion isn't just the clothes you wear it's about a world view the kinds of books you read the kind of food you want to eat and about choosing a certain way of living she says
<unk> doesn't regret the years she spent fine tuning commercial sense and says they served her well when she set up her own enterprise
i think it gave me critical business tools and even though i don't think that i realized the value of them back then i think today i really appreciate it

the typical coffee cup simply doesn't work in low gravity unless you want <unk> hot liquid floating through the air
it takes a special vessel to get liquid from an open container into an <unk> mouth
it also takes a <unk> lot of science as seen by the cup designed by portland state university researchers
for the past year scientists there have been developing a mug designed specifically to allow astronauts to sip on espresso in low gravity environments
the cup's shape is <unk> little like a plastic baby <unk> was determined by mathematical models
every curve and geometric shape is designed to encourage the controlled movement of liquid
you'll notice a pointed corner in the center of the cup
this strange bit of design is what makes it possible to drink liquids in low gravity
the corner essentially acts like a <unk> using surface tension to guide liquid toward your mouth
twelve most ancient and magnificent trees from around the world
as soon as an astronaut touches her mouth to the lip of the cup a <unk> connection is formed and the liquid travels up the vessel and forms <unk> balls of coffee
it sounds simple enough but designing a cup for space requires a deep understanding of how fluids move in low gravity
we're geeks and we make spacecraft fluid systems says mark weislogel a professor of mechanical and mechanical engineering who is leading the research
it's like space <unk>
on a day to day basis this means weislogel and his team solve problems like how to get rocket fuel to move on its own or how to process urine using a device that has no moving parts
it turns out that all the data gleaned from <unk> flow experiments aboard the international space station also is relevant in designing a low gravity espresso cup
what cities would look like if lit only by the stars
the project an evolution of don <unk> low gravity cup which he designed on the iss in two thousand and eight as a means of drinking coffee in something approaching a normal fashion
it used the same principles employed by the espresso <unk> sharp interior corner angle that draws liquid <unk> was far less sustainable and <unk> at that point
the portland team began working on the problem after italy announced it would send an espresso machine to the international space station later this year
no respectable espresso drinking astronaut wants to sip brew out of a bag
the pleasure of drinking espresso comes from the inhaling the <unk> and sipping the <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> that sit at the top of your glass
that can't happen when you're drinking from plastic bags
in a field where efficiency is priced above comfort it's fair to ask
who really needs an open top cup
but a reusable cup like this could actually be a boon for astronauts especially now that the iss has a three d printer on board
twenty one <unk> well designed products we're dying to own
once refined weislogel believes a design like this could save valuable volume and weight on a spacecraft destined for a long haul
that won't be for a while
the cups are still in the testing stage and they cost five hundred dollar to three d print in the transparent plastic
that's not exactly cheap but weislogel believes it's a relatively small price to pay when testing the same <unk> system theories would cost millions to test on rocket engines
it's a fast way to get a bunch of engineering and science data he says
also it's fun

watch the entire interview sunday on fareed zakaria gps at ten <unk>
i'm declining to meet with him simply because our general policy is we don't meet with any world leader two weeks before their election obama said in an interview with cnn's fareed zakaria
i think that's inappropriate and that's true with some of our closest allies
house speaker john boehner invited netanyahu to deliver a speech in front of congress in march
he's expected to use that speech to lobby for tough new sanctions against iran putting him at odds with obama who has threatened to veto additional sanctions as he tries to hash out a deal to halt iran's nuclear program
the president said the united states and britain had to quickly to put together a trip to washington for prime minister david cameron this month for the same reason obama wasn't meeting with netanyahu
cameron didn't want to make it closer to his country's may elections
he insisted that if he wants to come and it was a very important meeting he needs to be far away enough from the election that it doesn't look like in some ways we're <unk> or putting our thumbs on the scale obama said
obama downplayed differences with israel over his approach to iran saying he hasn't heard a <unk> rebuttal of my argument that we crafted very effective sanctions against iran specifically to bring them to the negotiations table
israeli intelligence has confirmed that iran has rolled back its <unk> of highly enriched uranium obama said
the president said imposing new sanctions now would give iran a way out of the talks an outcome no one wants
for us to undermine diplomacy at this critical time for no good reason is a mistake and that what we need to do is to finish up this round of negotiations put the pressure on iran to say yes to what the international community is calling for he said
see
why the iran sanctions fight is a big deal
obama said he's confident he can successfully lobby congress to approve a deal once it's struck
i've said before that we will take no deal over a bad deal obama said
but if i can prove that the deal we've put in place assures us through indisputable verification mechanisms that iran can not achieve breakout capacity if i've got a bunch of scientists and nuclear experts saying this assures us that iran is not on the brink of being a nuclear weapons power then that's a public debate we should have
and i will then ask every member of congress to ask why would we reject that deal and prefer a potential military option that would be less effective in <unk> iran's nuclear program and would have extraordinarily ramifications at a time when we've already got too many conflicts in the middle east he said
and i'm pretty confident i can win that argument

fortunately they can rely on one committed defender
eight year old alyssa carter
when i heard that rhinos were being killed they were my favorite animals and i wanted to start this says the elementary school <unk>
her campaign <unk> save the rhinos has raised thousands of dollars to protect her favorite animal south africa's <unk> threatened rhinoceros and fund an innovative scheme aimed at tracking the hunters who would do them harm
carter south africa national parks one and only rhino champion sells homemade chocolates for ten rand at her school
so far she has raised over twenty three thousand dollar through a combination of chocolate sales and donations from the growing number of people young and old who have filled halls to hear the young campaigner speak
it all started in may two thousand and thirteen when carter then aged six and a half came home from school and drew a picture
the same <unk> image of long <unk> rhino beneath a rainbow that is now stamped on her campaign's sweets and chocolate
her father brian carter says she'd been taught about the plight of endangered animals and burst out crying when she heard rhinos were being butchered by poachers
at home that night the family resolved to do something to help settling on the chocolates as a good place to start
her father was her first customer
originally she just wanted to do something to help he says
the idea was to sell to anybody that would buy so we started off by selling to friends and family <unk> and <unk> and people at church
for over a year she has been selling chocolates every friday at her supportive johannesburg primary school and has now grown her stall with rhino branded <unk> stickers <unk> and a range of <unk> rhino toys created by a well <unk> who had heard about her fundraising efforts
carter knows her most enthusiastic customers
singling out one particularly generous <unk> teacher <unk> and an exceptionally sweet <unk> class of her <unk> as her biggest supporters
dogs take bite out of poaching
what alyssa wanted to do was to give the money toward buying trained <unk> dogs to go into the kruger national park says dad brian
there across an area the size of new jersey park rangers fight a desperate battle with poachers to prevent the extinction of the rhinoceros whose horn is prized for its supposed value in traditional asian medicines
highly trained <unk> are a new addition to the park first arriving in two thousand and twelve
if they find a rhino lying dead they can sniff out where the poachers are explains alyssa carter allowing rangers track poachers just as the poachers themselves <unk> prey
dogs will soon patrol the park's entrance points too detecting weapons that poachers attempt to smuggle in and contraband including rhinoceros horn being transported out
at kruger south africa's largest wildlife reserve park authorities report an increase in contact with suspected poachers with rangers claiming before christmas that one hundred and sixty four had been arrested in the park over the year
with each dog's purchase training and <unk> costs running to over eight thousand dollar per dog they aren't cheap but the young rhino champion can now proudly boast to have already added two new k nine <unk> to the battle
but why rhinos
they're nice and with their big horns they look beautiful and i like looking for them in the wild explains carter
before starting <unk> save the rhinos the johannesburg resident had never seen a rhinoceros in its natural habitat
now she's been to kruger several times she says on invitation to meet the park's other <unk> rangers on a few occasions and recently visiting two <unk> dogs in training last summer
she eagerly snaps photographs of every animal she sees in the park but rhinos hold a special place
it's really nice because i know i'm doing something she says
carter says she keeps count of each of the rhino she sees and is up to one hundred and thirty something so far
carter is keen to talk to others about her experiences with rhinos standing up in front of seven hundred students at a school in december and nearly three hundred adults at a development conference earlier that year
she says it's just as easy to talk to grown ups as kids as long as her father is by her side
the elder carter says he wasn't involved in conservation before alyssa started her campaign and that the whole family has caught the young <unk> enthusiasm
the ambition now is for alyssa to talk at more corporate events including business golf days where she has found success encouraging <unk> to give to the cause
the bottom line is we need to raise more money says brian and we need to sell more chocolates
over the weekend christina booth called nine hundred and eleven to report that her three children were crying nonstop and needed medical attention according to a recent probable cause filing
the twenty eight year old and her husband thomas booth have three children a two year old and six month old twins
when officers arrived at the <unk> washington home saturday night they found a troubling scene
as spelled out by a local prosecutor police saw the twins on the couch crying <unk> and bleeding from their necks
one officer then went upstairs and found the couple's two year old in bed under the covers with dry blood all over her
all three were taken to a local hospital where cnn affiliate komo reports they underwent surgery
they are now in stable condition and will be placed in protective custody
in their probable cause filing authorities paint a picture of a mother overwhelmed and suffering from postpartum depression
a judge set bail for booth at three million dollar <unk> another cnn affiliate reported
the night that ended in tears and blood began with wine and a movie
in the probable cause filing thomas booth told investigators he had two large glasses and his wife had at least the same amount
thomas said he was feeling intoxicated the document reads and christina was intoxicated to the point that she was <unk> her words
as the movie wrapped up thomas booth told police his wife took the toddler upstairs to put her to bed but then a short time later christina came down the stairs in only her underwear crying and screaming
christina booth like her husband spoke to authorities without an attorney present
her story differs from her husband's slightly a local prosecutor said
she told a police detective that she was having a really rough time taking care of her three children
she said that her husband never helps and that he gets very annoyed when the children cry and make noise
like her husband christina booth said they were watching a movie and she went to put the toddler to bed just before the movie ended
she then told authorities that the twins started crying and she hit her breaking point
in the probable cause document a prosecutor says she confessed to the crimes of which she stands accused saying she knew if she killed all the kids the house would be quiet for thomas
during the interview christina broke down crying several times yelled about thomas never helping with the kids the document says
christina made the comment they will be quiet now several times
thomas booth told police that his wife has been very stressed out raising the children and that she took medication for postpartum depression
he also said she always takes the children out of his presence if they cry
the couple's account differs in where the attack on the twins took place
christina booth told authorities she carried them downstairs after attacking her toddler and cut their necks while they lay on the couch
her husband told police he found the babies upstairs with injuries to their necks and brought them downstairs to render first aid
thomas booth has not been charged and komo reports that police do not suspect he played any kind of role in the violence
komo reports he's an active duty soldier who was recently deployed overseas
neighbors described christina booth as sweet <unk> and a loving mother
<unk> <unk> who has spent time with the pair told komo i would have never suspected that she would be a person to take this kind of a drastic action
i can't imagine what stress she must have been under to cause her to do such a thing
komo reported that neighbors say christina booth was normally social but changed after giving birth to the twins
neighbor <unk> <unk> expressed concern to komo about the potential for missed opportunities to help the family
why weren't we knocking on the door
she said
i think that we need to rally and love to understand and not to judge
a message purporting to be from the islamist terror group sets a new deadline for a possible deal with the jordanian government
the latest demand
bring convicted terrorist sajida al rishawi to the turkish border by sunset thursday or jordanian isis hostage moaz al kassasbeh will be executed immediately
but is isis offering anything in return
from the latest message it's unclear
but previous video posts purportedly from isis have suggested the group was offering japanese hostage kenji goto's freedom in exchange for al rishawi's
cnn could not independently confirm the authenticity of the latest message which was read by a person claiming to be goto and posted online by isis supporters
in the message goto purportedly calls for al rishawi's release in exchange for my life
it's the latest twist in a complicated crisis with dizzying developments involving several countries
here's a look at the key people involved
goto an experienced japanese war journalist has been at the center of several threats by isis since his capture
last week the group demanded two hundred million dollar from japan in exchange for goto and fellow japanese hostage haruna yukawa an aspiring security contractor
since then isis has claimed yukawa is dead but goto is still alive
al kassasbeh a jordanian pilot was captured by isis last month after the fighter jet he was flying crashed in syria
isis says he's still alive but jordan's foreign minister told cnn his government has asked for a proof of life but hasn't received it
al rishawi is an iraqi prisoner on death row in jordan for her role in two thousand and five bombings
isis has demanded her release by sunset thursday
jordan has said it's willing to swap al rishawi for the jordanian pilot
jordanian foreign minister nasser judeh told cnn on wednesday that his country would release al rishawi if isis released al kassasbeh
even though his government's announcement of its offer doesn't mention goto the foreign minister said that the japanese journalist is not forgotten
of course goto's release would be part of a prisoner exchange judeh told cnn's christiane amanpour
but the priority for jordan is al kassasbeh's freedom he said
it wasn't clear whether isis would accept jordan's offer
with the fates of their sons hanging in the balance the families of goto and al kassasbeh called on their governments to do everything they can to save the hostages before time runs out
goto forty seven is reported to have three children two of them with his current wife
his mother begged japanese prime minister shinzo abe to secure her son's release
please save the life of kenji junko ishido said
i call on you to work with all your strength in negotiations with the jordanian government until the very end
al kassasbeh's father has called on jordanian authorities to act as well
i firmly ask whomever has sent moaz to fight outside the borders of jordan on a mission unrelated to us to make strong efforts to bring back moaz safi al kassasbeh said tuesday
isis says it captured al kassasbeh after he ejected from his f sixteen jet last month near raqqa the militant group's de facto capital in syria
<unk> blood is precious it's precious and it represents the blood of all jordanians his father said
but the pilot's father suggested his son's case shouldn't be mixed up with goto's
to link <unk> situation with the japanese journalist this has nothing to do with us he said
the japanese journalist has his country to defend him
isis which holds large areas of iraq and syria under its brutal rule has a grim track record of <unk> killing hostages
last year it publicized its series of beheadings of three american and two british captives
the group has made a series of demands regarding the jordanian and japanese hostages
in a saturday post purportedly from isis a voice thought to be goto's first set out the idea of exchanging him for al rishawi but no clear deadline was mentioned
in that post goto held a photo of what appeared to be yukawa's decapitated corpse
a post from the group on tuesday announced that time was suddenly in short supply for goto and the jordanian pilot
in that message the japanese hostage is shown handcuffed and dressed in orange holding a picture that appears to be al kassasbeh
i've been told this is my last message a voice purporting to be that of goto says demanding the prisoner exchange
the video had said that isis would kill al kassasbeh and goto within twenty four hours if jordan did not release al rishawi
cnn couldn't independently verify the authenticity of the messages
the japanese government said there was no evidence so far that it wasn't goto speaking in tuesday's video which was posted to youtube and distributed on social media by known isis supporters
on thursday japan's prime minister told lawmakers his government was analyzing the latest possible message from isis
given the nature of the issue we can not tell concrete details abe said
however within this extremely severe context the government has been requesting cooperation from the government of jordan and will continue making the utmost effort for swift release of mr. goto
i felt really sorry for him said award winning australian artist ben quilty who has been mentoring <unk> a convicted drug <unk> in <unk> <unk> prison since late two thousand and eleven
but i also said myuran what are you doing
are you just going to sit around and wait for this
you've got nothing else to do go back to work and start making paintings
so he did
in the last week or so sukumaran has thrown himself into his painting and the prison art classes he set up and leads five days a week
he knows that in the days or weeks ahead he could be led out of his cell with andrew chan his co conspirator in a failed two thousand and five drug plot blindfolded and shot by an indonesian firing squad
the men now aged thirty three and thirty one can only wait and hope that a final legal bid succeeds in saving their lives
later this week the men's indonesian lawyers hope to file what's known as a <unk> to request a second judicial review
australian lawyer julian mcmahon said there's a strong basis for another review to be granted
the first <unk> was filed four years ago and was eventually rejected however so the next step was the clemency process under the clemency law and the constitution mcmahon said
however he said that while the matter was being considered by the offices of the previous and current president the law changed to allow for a second judicial review
he said it's not appropriate to file a second judicial review while the matter is sitting with the president
now that the letters from the president have rejected clemency that enables the second judicial review to be brought on
lawyers will be pointing to evidence of the men's rehabilitation in prison
during their time behind bars they've said to have become respected inmates who have built a support network for others around them
they're both behaving in a very <unk> way mcmahon said who visited them in prison as recently as wednesday morning
they're looking after their families who are visiting and they're both working hard on the same things they've been doing for years

president joko widodo has made it clear he won't be stepping in to save the pair the only two of the drug gang known as the bali nine who were sentenced to death
widodo told cnn's christiane amanpour earlier this week every day we have fifty people die because of narcotics of drugs
in one year it's eighteen thousand people who die because of narcotics
we are not going to compromise for drug dealers
no compromise
no compromise
the last time quilty visited sukumaran in his prison art class he said the talented painter had already worked out a succession plan so the classes would continue without him
last time i felt like he wasted an hour with me just talking through the logistics about how the classes would run if he's gone which was very upsetting quilty said
he pointed out to me in the class quietly who the strong artists were with the most future in the art practice
and he also introduced me to the two young indonesian men who he's basically mentoring to take over his role if he's gone
last weekend the families of both men made a public appeal for their lives to be spared
i'm confident that if knows what they've done and how much they have changed i'm sure he would not have the heart to order them to be executed <unk> mother <unk> sukumaran said <unk>
the men were arrested in bali in two thousand and five after australian federal police told indonesian authorities that they'd received a tip off
four <unk> with heroin strapped to the bodies were arrested with chan as they tried to leave indonesia
sukumaran was detained in a <unk> hotel with three others who had been enlisted as <unk>
on thursday night a <unk> <unk> organized by quilty will be held in sydney's martin place as a show of support for the two prisoners
musicians will perform in a concert called music for mercy
quilty said it's not an attempt to convince the indonesian authorities to spare them that's out of my hands but a personal tribute to his friend and to show sukumaran that he and chan are not alone
it seemed like there was a very dark inevitability about what was going to happen to myuran
and i thought what can i do
i thought i can actually show the boys that there are people who care for them just to give them a sense of dignity i guess
the forty three year old former russian agent turned kremlin critic pointed his finger directly at vladimir putin then as now russia's <unk> president
you may succeed in silencing me but that silence comes at a price litvinenko said in the statement from his <unk>
you may succeed in silencing one man but the <unk> of protest from around the world will <unk> mr. putin in your ears for the rest of your life

did russia put polonium in <unk> tea
it's an allegation the kremlin has never really managed to shake off
officials have always dismissed the charge as nonsense but suspicions linger
the <unk> case isn't much helped by the compelling evidence against it
the poison used to kill litvinenko is a rare radioactive <unk> polonium two hundred and ten
it occurs naturally but scientists say the high <unk> found in the litvinenko case indicate production at a nuclear reactor or perhaps a particle accelerator
the kinds of facilities in other words controlled by a state
russia isn't the only country capable of producing polonium two hundred and ten
but the radioactive trail left by the substance literally a trail of <unk> radioactive material was traced across london while three british airways aircraft that had flown a number of routes including london to moscow were reported to be contaminated with small traces of an unnamed radioactive substance
the two prime suspects in the poisoning <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> are russian nationals
both are former agents of the russian security services
but both deny involvement and the russian government refuses to extradite either to britain to face trial
litvinenko had many enemies
he was a former agent of the russian federal security service the fsb the post soviet successor of the feared kgb
his last job at the agency was heading up its anti corruption department
it was in the chaos of the one thousand nine hundred and ninety s in the aftermath of the collapse of the soviet union that may well have brought him into conflict with ruthless colleagues
after leaving the fsb he blamed the service for orchestrating a series of apartment bombings in russia in one thousand nine hundred and ninety nine that left hundreds dead and led to russia's invasion of chechnya later that year
litvinenko's wife also claimed her husband was in the pay of the british security services after moving to the uk in two thousand
all or any of the above may have been sufficient reason to kill a man seen by his former fsb colleagues as a <unk>
there are some questions that even the public inquiry now underway in britain may never be able to answer
why for instance was polonium two hundred and ten chosen to kill litvinenko
it would have been a costly and complicated task to produce the quantity used in the murder
a bullet would have been much cheaper
perhaps the killers hoped it would not have been detected by british investigators
or perhaps they wanted to send a message pointing the police towards an <unk> they knew would never be held to account
but the biggest question of all is whether the killing was ordered by the state or was the work of rogue elements within it
perhaps only president putin himself a former kgb agent has the answer to that
are you covered in snow
please share your images with cnn ireport if you can do so safely
to be sure it will be nothing compared to what has already fallen this week
<unk> massachusetts received a record thirty four point five inches from monday through wednesday
there's so much of it you have a problem because there's just nothing to do with it a resident told cnn affiliate <unk>
he compared it with a blizzard in one thousand nine hundred and seventy eight and a storm in two thousand and thirteen
this is much worse he said
it just never stopped
for many people in new england this blizzard brought <unk> conditions from heavy snow and wind greater than thirty five mph for as long as fourteen hours
in towns and cities from connecticut to massachusetts to new hampshire there were plenty of folks who were digging through more than thirty inches of fresh snow on sidewalks and <unk>
homeowners weren't just dealing with the question of where to put all the snow
some had to call their insurance agents like residents of eleven homes in <unk> massachusetts where there was significant damage after a <unk> breach
after <unk> the streets tuesday as the storm struck traffic moved again along major roads in massachusetts and beyond
boston's logan international airport accepted incoming flights around eight a.m. according to spokesman matthew <unk>
buses and trains in massachusetts including the boston area subway system the t ran again with major roads reopened as well said incoming state transportation secretary stephanie pollack
but schools in boston were closed as they will be thursday
the national weather service said wednesday that another system is moving toward the area and several more inches of snow could come down thursday night into friday night
the high on saturday is forecast to be sixteen degrees
cnn senior meteorologist dave <unk> said as the low pressure develops off the coast damaging winds might yet again be in store for new england on friday and saturday
if anyone has a right to complain it was those digging out wednesday not just in new england but also on new york's long island
the weather service reported that orient on the tip of long island ended up with thirty inches of snow
that's about ten inches more than fell across long island sound in new london connecticut though mayor <unk> justin <unk> noted that his city has up to eight foot <unk> and some roads that were still <unk> wednesday morning
we're getting there said <unk>
but it will be another day or two digging out from this
this isn't going anywhere
there are still a few dead ends that we still need to punch through to get to to make sure that people can get out of their houses the mayor said
one good thing
because it was colder than expected most of the snow didn't weigh enough to snap too many limbs down onto too many power lines
so instead of three hundred thousand power outages in massachusetts as authorities had feared the number topped out at thirty six thousand according to massachusetts emergency management agency spokesman peter judge
although we may end up with record snow it's not going to be a record disaster which it could have very well been judge said
still any outage can be deadly in a winter storm like this
and at one point an entire island nantucket was in the dark
four hours after the power went out danielle smith gave birth to her first child at nantucket cottage hospital with a few lights on and some heat thanks to the facility's generator
and danielle is a superstar said dr. margaret <unk> who noted that a blizzard girl joined <unk> blizzard boy <unk> a short time later at the same hospital
she did it all naturally
in central connecticut heather klein felt her <unk> coming on overnight monday
after getting the ok from <unk> police to break the travel ban she drove in and settled into the hospital in time for the birth of her baby anna
mom and baby had plenty of quality time together tuesday since visitors couldn't hit the roads to come see them
it's so boring klein said
i can't wait to go home
for jennifer bruno there's no going home
the iraq war veteran had evacuated to a friend's house overnight knowing that things might not be safe in her own home of <unk> a town of twenty five thousand located thirty miles south of boston
when she got back home the national guard sergeant broke down in tears
part of the roof collapsed the wall my door was missing bruno said of her house
it was just destroyed
she wasn't alone as ten other homes in the same <unk> town were also damaged after the powerful storm tore down about fifty feet of <unk>
two of the houses were damaged badly enough to be condemned
there was significant flooding there and in other coastal communities around massachusetts which had to deal not only with storm <unk> but lashing winds that in some places topped seventy five mph
even so there is also recognition that for the vast majority of the fifty eight million people in the storm's path especially given the dire warnings it could have been even worse
despite the fact that we had record breaking snowfall in many parts of massachusetts gov

the world no
one has never lost in melbourne when she's played a semifinal or final going ten zero with her record overall in grand slam semifinals and finals an impressive forty seven
further not since the two thousand and eleven u.s. open has the thirty three year old fallen in a grand slam semifinal or final
those are indeed ominous numbers for her semifinal opponent and fellow american madison keys who prevented an all williams encounter in the last four when she edged venus williams six three four six six four
keys became the third young surprise <unk> at the australian open in three seasons joining <unk> bouchard and <unk> stephens
but serena williams wasn't looking too far ahead just yet
the eighteen time grand slam winner was simply happy to advance to the semifinals having not done so in melbourne since capturing the title in two thousand and ten
it's finally good to get past the quarterfinals or the fourth round she said
i forgot what it's like for this place for melbourne to look a little empty
gosh it's been so long
she progressed over two thousand and fourteen finalist <unk> despite continuing to struggle with a sore throat
i've been sick the past few days she said
it's just getting worse and worse
but hopefully it will start getting better
i heard it's a virus going around with a lot of the players
i think i caught it
the nineteen year old keys will attempt to go one better than bouchard and stephens when she takes on serena in a maiden semifinal at a major
against venus williams the powerful keys wasn't without her own health issues calling the trainer for a thigh injury in the second set
she'll hope the injury gets better and fast since keys won't have a day off prior to the <unk>
it still hurts said keys
definitely going to be getting some treatment on that
keys rallied from a break down in the final set against the seven time grand slam champion who was competing in her first major quarterfinal in five years
she was helped by her opponent who committed thirty eight unforced errors to go along with only ten winners
in the third set alone venus williams hit three winners and thirteen unforced errors
this is her moment today said venus williams
i think it was pretty rare that i was able to string together three or four points without an error
that was unfortunate for me today
but next time i'll be able to play more solid
it's definitely been a great last like four weeks i think added williams who won a <unk> event in <unk>
a lot of match wins a lot of momentum just a lot of great things happening that everybody wants to happen in their career
i think a lot of players would have been happy with this tournament
i'm happy with progress
i'm not happy with a loss i'll tell you that
the other semifinal is an all russian affair maria sharapova challenges <unk> makarova
when they met at the u.s. open in the quarterfinals nishikori upset wawrinka in five sets before later making his first grand slam final
wawrinka rallied from a five one deficit in a fourth set tiebreak in his previous match against <unk> garcia lopez but almost blew a six one lead in the fourth set tiebreak versus nishikori
the japanese <unk> drew level at six six only to then miss a drop shot into the net when he was controlling the rally
that one i was really happy because i was not going to get to that ball wawrinka told reporters
wawrinka closed out the match with a big serve
wawrinka improved to sixteen four in <unk> in melbourne including five zero this year
he'll next battle world no

dubai airports released its year end traffic report on tuesday in which it reported a total of seventy point four million passengers in two thousand and fourteen up six point one percents over the previous year
in comparison heathrow reported around sixty eight point one million international passengers in two thousand and fourteen
this historic milestone is the culmination of over five decades of double digit average growth that were inspired by the vision of the late sheikh <unk> bin saeed al <unk> said sheikh ahmed bin saeed al <unk> chairman of dubai airports in a statement
the shared goal is to make dubai a global center of aviation and we are nearing that goal thanks to an open skies policy a friendly business environment dubai's growing <unk> as a center for trade commerce and tourism growing network connectivity due to the rapid expansion of emirates and <unk> and timely investment in aviation infrastructure
the figures are somewhat surprising given dubai international's aircraft movements totaled three hundred and fifty seven thousand three hundred and thirty nine in two thousand and thirteen down three point four percents from two thousand and thirteen
this decrease was primarily due to the temporary reduction of flights during an eighty day runway <unk> project during the summer with some operations shifted to al <unk> international dubai's second airport at dubai world central
so how did dubai international end up with more passengers in two thousand and fourteen
in two thousand and fourteen the number of passengers per flight increased five point one percent to two hundred and eight point three for the full year
the airport attributes this boost to the ongoing increase in the number of wide bodied aircraft <unk> the facility
dubai based airline emirates has fifty seven a three hundred and eighty s making it the world's largest operator of the double deck wide body jet
much like two thousand and fourteen two thousand and fifteen promises to be another eventful year featuring more record passenger numbers and facility upgrades including the opening of <unk> d which will boost dubai international's capacity to ninety million said paul griffiths ceo of dubai airports
the airport also released two thousand and fifteen traffic projections this week saying it expected to see seventy nine million passengers this year

at a news conference in mexico city tuesday murillo karam said ninety nine suspects have been detained so far
authorities have also obtained hundreds of testimonies confessions and pieces of evidence
these and other elements we found during the investigation allowed us to carry out an analysis about the logical causes and without a doubt we can conclude that the students at the teachers college were abducted killed burned and thrown into the san juan river in that order murillo karam said
as to why they were killed <unk> zern de lucio the head of mexico's criminal investigations agency said it was a case of mistaken identity
in other words the criminal group accused of executing the students thought they belonged to a rival gang also operating around the town of iguala where the students were last seen
we can conclude that the motivation was consistent the students were identified by the criminals as members of an organized crime rival group that operated in the region
that was the reason why they were deprived of their freedom initially and then of their lives zern de lucio said
former iguala mayor jose luis <unk> has been charged in the case and is awaiting trial as the accused mastermind of the abduction and execution of the forty three students
authorities say he wanted to prevent the students from disrupting an event by his wife the night they went missing
the students were believed to have been captured by iguala police and turned over to a gang
there is no indication that <unk> wanted them all dead authorities said but the gang <unk> them for a rival group and executed them
<unk> wife maria de los angeles <unk> has also been charged
the case has caused an uproar in mexico with countless protests and demonstrations which at times turned violent
at a news conference tuesday the parents of the students refused to believe authorities even suggesting the mexican military <unk> been behind the disappearance of the young men
the students attending a rural teachers college were left wing anti government activists mostly in their late teens and early twenties
murillo karam <unk> denied the army had anything to do with the case saying there weren't even enough soldiers in the area at the time of the disappearance to <unk> and execute forty three students
part of the problem is that so far the remains of only one student have been positively identified and parents are asking what happened to the other forty two
but the head of the criminal investigations agency says the remains were so badly burned that extracting dna samples for identification is now impossible
the ashes were thrown into the nearby san juan river
the dental remains found in what was the middle of the fire show that the temperature reached one thousand six hundred degrees celsius which dehydrated <unk> <unk> and fused the remains
this makes it impossible to extract dna samples even with the most advanced technology zern de lucio said
at a public event mexico's president said tuesday it's time to turn the page
i'm convinced that we should not remain trapped in this instant this moment in mexico's history of sorrow of tragedy and pain
we just can't dwell here <unk> <unk> said
recently he completed a dizzying non stop trip that would set most people's heads spinning
it took four days and he <unk> two hundred and seventy thousand miles
he admits that the journey was exhausting but ultimately worth it
to put it into some kind of perspective it's enough miles for two first class tickets between the u.s. and asia he notes
if i would have paid cash for them they would have each cost me over twenty thousand dollar
december which marks the last opportunity for many frequent fliers to earn enough to gain their elite <unk> is mile run season
in the past the trick was looking for a cheap ticket that went the distance as miles earned were calculated by well miles flown
this year that is all set to change
in thirty three years of frequent flier programs this is the year of the biggest changes ever says randy petersen founder of the online travel forum <unk> and ceo of frequent flyer services which offers guidance to road warriors the world over
some of the world's largest frequent flier programs are going to a revenue model he explains noting that come this year many programs will start awarding members based on how much they spend not how far they fly
air new zealand started the trend when it introduced <unk> dollars in two thousand and four
other airlines have followed suit over the years such as virgin australia <unk> and southwest
starting this month both delta and united shifted to a completely revenue based system of calculating miles earned
petersen predicts it's only a matter of time before the european carriers follow suit
they may say they won't because they don't want to upset things but these are part of alliances
over the next two years i think you'll start to see revenue based frequent flier programs <unk> out through the rest of the airline industry
petersen notes there's also been a shift in hotel awards programs
a lot of hotel programs are changing what it costs per night come january
if you're planning on <unk> hotel rooms later this year do it now
get the <unk> at lower prices he advises
as for points earned and spent on plane tickets there's little to be done but to accept airlines change in policy
it's too late for you to do anything
but here's what you don't do
do not buy a more expensive ticket to earn miles
you'd be playing into what the airlines want
it's okay to earn fewer miles on a cheap ticket because you'll still be able to find cheap awards out there he says
corey <unk> <unk> twenty one and brandon robert <unk> twenty one were each convicted on four counts of aggravated rape one count of attempted aggravated rape and two counts of aggravated sexual battery
<unk> was also convicted of <unk> with evidence and unlawful photography
the victim who was unconscious when she was raped in a <unk> on june twenty three two thousand and thirteen released a written statement that was read to the media by an assistant district attorney
it said she hoped publicity from the case would help spur conversation on how to end sexual assaults in all college campuses
finally i want to remind other victims of sexual violence
you are not alone
you are not to blame the victim's statement said according to cnn affiliate <unk>
the victim was in court tuesday and cried when the verdicts were read the station reported
sexual violence against women is wrong said davidson county district attorney general glenn <unk> according to cnn affiliate <unk>
don't blame the culture
don't blame alcohol
don't blame the victim
sexual violence is a crime and it will be prosecuted
the jury <unk> for three hours the cnn affiliates reported
prosecutors had argued that the two men who were teammates on the football team had a feeling of entitlement when <unk> brought his twenty one year old unconscious date to his dorm room
according to cnn affiliate <unk> the victim testified she remembers nothing from that night
each man was represented by a different attorney but they both argued that the players were very drunk that night and the video of the incident didn't prove guilt <unk> reported
albert perez jr. who represents <unk> said his client was unable to comprehend what happened
it's very difficult for a person who is young to understand what happened because he asked me what happened
he didn't understand the attorney said <unk> reported
another of his attorneys <unk> long told cnn they will consider an appeal but won't make a decision on that until sentencing
he said the state failed to prepare a proper indictment
<unk> lawyer <unk> robinson said there were several tragedies in this case according to the station
<unk> vice chancellor for public affairs said sexual violence will not be tolerated at the prestigious school
the two men were both kicked off the football team and kicked out of school months ago beth fortune said
we are confident we acted appropriately she said
our heart goes out to the victim
her testimony was forceful and brave
she has received our care and support

after two years of fundraising and wrestling with government bureaucracy rodrigues arrived at a place some might call a version of <unk>
the alto <unk> reserve where the awa guaja roam
i wanted to show the daily life in the world's most endangered tribe he said
the awa <unk> way of life is being threatened by relentless loggers who are illegally <unk> on their land according to brazil's national indian foundation
many awa indians have had little to no contact with the outside world but that is beginning to change the foundation reports as loggers continue to destroy the forests their existence depends on
rodrigues set out to document the <unk> existence pure pristine and tragically <unk>
i had traveled to africa and other remote places where people at least knew what a camera was rodrigues said
here i was in the twenty one st century with other humans who had never seen a camera a computer
never seen a shower and were shocked when they saw a helicopter
and yet they are extremely happy
calling themselves awa <unk> <unk> for man the tribe is made of forest <unk> and <unk> hunters
challenges abound said rodrigues who was forced to communicate with hand gestures for several weeks because the <unk> did not speak portuguese
i pointed this way to say the sun is setting and made hand signs to ask questions about hunting rodrigues recalled
they were incredibly friendly and i was very well received
spending weeks without <unk> words rodrigues immersed himself in the visual <unk> of the awa guaja life in the forest
twelve hour hunting <unk> were common cutting through thick jungle growth during the monsoon rains
nature's <unk> sounds rang behind every moment something his photographs seem to <unk> to
<unk> from the use of formal <unk> often seen in <unk> rodrigues black and white photos are filled with an honesty that could only come as a result of an <unk> pact with his subjects
the awa clearly trusted rodrigues camera and in the resulting work we can clearly see how well <unk> he became with the ins and outs of the awa way of life
the cinematic quality of some of the shots in the hunting scenes is a testament to the photographer's endurance and appreciation of a highly spiritual form of <unk>
we walked and walked for hours <unk> through the forest <unk> to look for the prey rodrigues said
the awa were barefoot the whole time
rodrigues <unk> talked about a dangerous situation while hunting for the indigenous red <unk>
the hunter had missed a shot and the <unk> jumped right over towards me he said
in the meantime i was having an allergic reaction to a spider bite
it wasn't easy
there are several groups of the awa guaja in this part of the forest
some have been known to exist since the one thousand nine hundred and seventy s. others have been contacted in the early one thousand nine hundred and eighty s. many are believed to still be in hiding
earlier this month brazil's official news agency reported that three isolated awa indians had made contact with the other mainstream awa guaja
the group's leader <unk> reportedly said that loggers were marking trees and threatening to kill them
the brazilian government has launched a massive military operation into the states of <unk> and <unk> today the epicenter in the war between loggers and indians
latest satellite imagery shows that new logging tracks are constantly being carved
monitoring and preserving such a large expanse of tropical forest is a challenge
in the meantime how can the so called civilized world understand what is being lost
getting out of my comfort zone my comfortable bed to walk for hours through virgin forest crossing rivers and rapids with water up to my neck
hearing the <unk> songs of the hunters as they walked home a large prey to share with their <unk> this experience can completely change a human being
haze episodes have occurred in southeast asia nearly every year since
back in one thousand nine hundred and ninety eight and for years afterwards tan didn't think too deeply about them
yet at some point in his late twenty s he began to wonder
where did the haze come from
and why did it keep coming back
air pollution kills around seven million people every year according to the world health organization accounting for one in eight deaths worldwide in two thousand and twelve
the main causes of death were stroke and heart disease followed by chronic <unk> pulmonary disease lung cancer and respiratory infections among children
it is especially bad in the asia pacific region which has a population of over four point two billion and high population density
china and india alone with a combined population of around two point seven billion are both enormous sources and victims of air pollution
in two thousand and ten forty percents of the world's premature deaths caused by air pollution were in china the world's largest <unk> of carbon dioxide according to a survey published in the lancet
the university of hong kong's school of public health reported more than three thousand premature deaths in the city in two thousand and thirteen and the situation in many mainland chinese cities is <unk> to be far worse
a poll by the u.s. pew research center found that forty seven percents of chinese citizens thought air pollution to be a very big problem in two thousand and thirteen
it is now a central focus for many chinese environmental groups and a growing source of anxiety for the country's leadership
similar health concerns are building in india where air pollution is now the fifth leading cause of death
between two thousand and two thousand and ten the annual number of premature deaths linked to air pollution across india rose six fold to six hundred and twenty thousand according to the center for science and environment a public interest research and advocacy group in new delhi
in may two thousand and fourteen the who said that new delhi had the worst air of one thousand six hundred cities surveyed worldwide and that rising air pollution had increased the risk of strokes cancers and heart disease
another two thousand and fourteen study has linked a significant drop in india's wheat and rice crop yields to rising levels of two air pollutants black carbon from rural cooking <unk> and ground level ozone formed from motor vehicle <unk> industrial emissions and chemical <unk> between one thousand nine hundred and eighty and two thousand and ten
in both china and india air pollution is one consequence of a massive exodus from farm to city that has occurred in recent decades
the change has contributed to rising emissions from both vehicles and factories especially coal fired power plants and an emerging middle class that increasingly desires a range of consumer goods that are common in europe and the united states
southeast asia has encountered similar problems in recent decades as its economies and populations have <unk>
in fact according to the who nearly one million of the three point seven million people who died from ambient air pollution in two thousand and twelve lived in southeast asia
but on top of <unk> and <unk> the region faces an added burden
smoke haze produced in indonesia that is a by product of the world's fifty billion dollar palm oil industry
in the summer of two thousand and thirteen a plane carried tan yi han over the straits of <unk> to pekanbaru the capital of riau province the largest palm oil production region in indonesia
tan then a twenty eight year old financial consultant was volunteering with the global environment center a malaysian group that has worked for years to prevent and mitigate haze
he traveled to the heart of neighboring indonesia just after a record breaking haze episode hit <unk> malaysia
on a driving tour in riau he saw endless acres of burned out landscapes
fires had turned <unk> peat <unk> the area's natural vegetation into land whose parched surface resembled charcoal
these fires are to dry out the peatlands for agricultural uses mainly the cultivation of oil palms
but in some villages fires had even destroyed existing oil palm trees that belonged to multinational companies or local farmers
tan had a memorable encounter in the village of <unk> <unk>
a couple there <unk> him with tea and snacks then quietly asked if he could spare any of his own food for them
their daughter had developed a respiratory problem because of the haze
the surprise medical bill coupled with the fire destroying their oil palm crops had left the family <unk> and hungry
until that moment he had mostly thought of peat <unk> as forest fires as they are often called in media reports
but here was a visceral reminder that the fires affect working land and real people
it really touched me said tan
i made a promise to myself that i'd do my best to prevent them from suffering from fires again
it was an issue he felt that required far more public discussion and when the time was right action
i must get more people involved he had thought and turn this into a movement
<unk> skies may all look similar but the emissions from any particular source are unique
a factory <unk> in beijing releases a different mix of chemical compounds into the atmosphere than an automobile <unk> in new delhi does
and the extent of pollution in a given city will depend on how carefully emissions are controlled and how easily they can be dispersed
vehicle and factory emissions have been analyzed for decades in high income countries but haze smoke and its impact on health is not well understood
not many people have investigated it even though it's a very important phenomenon said <unk> kuwata an atmospheric chemist at singapore's <unk> technological university
unlike factory and vehicle emissions <unk> smoke is not regulated by <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> or other pollution <unk> applications
the composition of the smoke also varies widely according to the type of material that is burning
peatlands for example typically take a longer time to burn than drier matter just as a damp piece of wood takes longer to burn in a <unk>
according to the u.s. environmental protection agency peat fires burn at lower temperatures and produce smoke that is more harmful and in larger quantities than the average forest fire or <unk> fire does
the emissions from a given peat fire will largely depend on the <unk> composition its burning temperature and how far below the ground the fire occurs
but such details aren't yet available in indonesia whose peatlands cover an area roughly the size of the united kingdom
as a result kuwata told me we do not have a very reliable inventory of the country's <unk> fire data
kuwata burns indonesian peat in his singapore laboratory to study its chemical properties but his work is limited he said because he can never be sure whether his experiments mirror reality
indonesia has an enormous repository of tropical peatlands and for a generation areas of these have been burned to prepare the land for the cultivation of oil palms
peat smoke now contributes around forty percents of indonesia's overall greenhouse gas emissions
palm oil is an ingredient in a range of consumer products from <unk> to ice cream
yet it has also helped to give its source country the dubious distinction of being the world's third largest greenhouse gas <unk> after china and the united states as well as a leading source of hazardous smoke haze
on a summer afternoon the skies were a <unk> white in riau the indonesian province that produces about a quarter of indonesia's palm oil
my first stop was the headquarters of <unk> an ngo in the city of pekanbaru that <unk> the indonesian government for action on haze and other environmental problems
i arrived at <unk> headquarters a low rise residential building near the pekanbaru airport just as a group of farmers and environmental activists were discussing haze over coffee and cigarettes with sri <unk> qodriyatun a researcher for the secretary general of indonesia's parliament
qodriyatun said her boss had dispatched her to riau to compile a report on haze
at the meeting she explained that according to government estimates forest fires were generally not occurring in areas owned by large plantations
government statements about haze are false
shouted an activist from a local ngo forest rescue riau network
and there's no coordination between ministers they just pass the blame around
the exchange underscored the long running debate across southeast asia about who exactly is responsible for indonesia's peat fires
farmers and environmental groups often accuse companies many of which are headquartered in singapore or malaysia of <unk>
but many companies say such criticism is <unk> and that they have largely reformed their destructive land clearing practices in recent years through voluntary reform initiatives like the roundtable on sustainable palm oil an industry led consortium
whoever is right said qodriyatun the fires have damaged indonesia's international reputation and the indonesian government pays little attention to their health implications in riau and beyond
personally i don't think the government is managing this well she told me after the meeting
usually they just react after the fires start but they should think more about prevention
peat fires though are notoriously hard to predict and <unk>
they start and spread easily and sometimes <unk> depending on conditions like wind speed the depth of the soil and the <unk> of the air
it's really hard to know how bad a fire will be when it starts said <unk> tarsedi a farmer in the riau village of bungaraya
we were sitting in a roadside caf flanked by oil palm trees
tarsedi told me that oil palm is the crop of choice for bungaraya farmers because it is more valuable than paddy rice
a <unk> of oil palm he said typically earns a farmer around forty eight million indonesian rupiah per year
paddy rice by contrast brings in just forty million rupiah
but as oil palm cultivation has increased in the village so have fires
and they affect both corporate plantations and <unk> farmers
if a fire happens and we can't control it we'll report it said <unk> a bungaraya farmer
but sometimes even helicopters are powerless to stop the burning he added
and during the really bad fires a lot of the kids cough and end up at the clinic with health problems
in two thousand and nine indonesia passed a law banning fires on peat plantations
farmers in bungaraya told me that as a result they had started to clear peat <unk> manually without using fire
but tarsedi said manual clearance is more labor intensive and requires extra <unk>
and that he said requires extra time and money that most farmers don't want to part with
when the wind blows from the west smoke can whip east across the straits of <unk> and into both singapore and kuala lumpur collectively home to about seven million people
south east asia is not the only place where the burning of vegetation occurs over large areas
most of the world's fires occur in africa and south america
but southeast asia's fires are unique says miriam <unk> an atmospheric researcher at columbia university because they occur so close to dense urban centers
there are no comprehensive studies on how repeated exposure to peat smoke affects human health over the long term much less how peat <unk> chemical properties differ from other kinds of biomass smoke
yet emerging research offers early clues
u.s. researchers have found that peat fires in the southern states during the summer of two thousand and eight caused a spike in emergency room visits for heart failure and asthma related respiratory complications
in a follow up study published in june two thousand and fourteen they burned semi charred peat from the fires in the vicinity of lab mice
subsequent pulmonary problems in the mice were mainly linked to <unk> grained smoke particles and cardiac problems to finer grained particles
a primary concern from a health perspective is that peat fires tend to generate larger amounts of fine grained particulate matter called pm two point five than normal forest fires
that is worrying mainly because finer grained particles are thought to penetrate further into the bloodstream than <unk> ones do posing a potentially higher risk to the heart and other internal organs
finer grained particles are also harder to block with the simple surgical masks that many people in asian cities have traditionally worn as protection against air pollution
a widely cited two thousand and twelve study published in the journal environmental health perspectives estimated that about three hundred and thirty nine thousand deaths between one thousand nine hundred and ninety seven and two thousand and six were associated with landscape fires
about four in five deaths were linked to chronic rather than sporadic exposure
sub saharan africa and southeast asia accounted for one hundred and fifty seven thousand and one hundred and ten thousand deaths respectively and the rate of mortality spiked during years dominated by the el nino weather phenomenon which typically <unk> with drier conditions in southeast asia
reducing population level exposure to air pollution from landscape fires is a worthwhile endeavor that is likely to have immediate and measurable health benefits the researchers concluded
another two thousand and twelve study by miriam <unk> and other scientists from american and british institutions found that between one and eleven percents of south east asia's population was repeatedly exposed to pollution above the who's recommended air quality levels during sporadic haze episodes between one thousand nine hundred and ninety seven and two thousand and six
elevated exposure during el nino years caused around fifteen thousand cardiovascular linked adult deaths per year the researchers wrote
roughly two thirds of those were linked to fine grained pm two point five particles while the other third were linked to levels of ozone
however there was not enough evidence available to determine exactly how the <unk> of pm two point five in peat fires differed from that of pm two point five emissions in american cities
some scientists suggest that peat <unk> long term effects on humans may be broadly similar to those of urban air pollution which also includes pm two point five particles
no one is sure because so little research has been done to test the theory
<unk> balasubramanian an american environmental engineer who studies haze at the national university of singapore <unk> that long term exposure to haze episodes could potentially make the population less healthy over time even if people continue to live long lives
in a two thousand and thirteen study he and his colleagues found that the air above singapore during a smoke haze episode contained <unk> <unk> <unk> and other <unk> elements
they estimated that normal urban levels of pm two point five pollution would cause about twelve out of every million <unk> to develop cancer over a lifetime but if haze were to occur for ten days per year over seventy straight years the number of likely cancer cases would increase by nearly half
yet there still is no coordinated international effort to <unk> haze in a truly <unk> fashion
that is partly due to the sporadic and unpredictable nature of haze balasubramanian said
southeast asia's highly variable weather makes it tricky to predict when haze will appear or where it could spread
he <unk> a particle of peat smoke to a <unk> that jumps into the air shoots along <unk> then quickly <unk> back to earth only to jump again
another problem balasubramanian said is that the general public does not yet view haze as a serious health threat
people view it as oh yeah it's a problem that occurs in indonesia he told me one afternoon in his office at the national university of singapore
for governments and funding bodies the <unk> more mitigation
how to mitigate human exposure to this haze issue rather than to study the problem itself
the task of <unk> pollution is also <unk> by politics
countries in southeast asia have little control over what blows across their borders
unlike the european union the association of southeast asian nations lacks the legal authority to force its members to act against their own interests
a case in point is asean's two thousand and two trans boundary haze agreement a non binding document in which the group's ten member states pledged to prevent and monitor peat fires
the agreement called for technology exchanges and other measures to improve regional dialogue and cooperation on haze
it was initially hailed as a landmark achievement but until september two thousand and fourteen indonesia's parliament had refused to <unk> it
<unk> m <unk> an environmental lawyer based in the indonesian capital of jakarta said that was mainly because indonesia has long tried to use the haze agreement as a way to leverage singapore into overturning a refusal to extradite indonesian citizens who are wanted for crimes in their homeland
asean tends to view economic development national sovereignty and mutual non interference as its highest priorities said helena <unk> a senior lecturer in the department of international and strategic studies at the university of <unk>
in her view asean has taken a mild <unk> approach to haze fighting out of deference to powerful palm oil companies many of them based in singapore or malaysia
indeed many analysts have said that indonesia's land concessions areas allocated for commercial plantations are deeply <unk> with corruption
a popular joke has it that if indonesia's <unk> concession maps were all counted as national territory the country would grow in size
but companies and officials mostly refuse to share those maps with the public
it's a mess said <unk> <unk> a research analyst at the jakarta office of the world resources institute a research organization headquartered in washington dc
it's also another reason why indonesia's peatlands continue to burn
against this backdrop tan yi han the singaporean financial consultant and self styled haze activist is hoping to influence the regional debate on haze
in early two thousand and fourteen he founded a citizens organization called people's movement to stop haze or pm haze to kick start the discussion
my gut feeling is we need influence tan said at a sunday evening pm haze meeting
there was only one other participant
<unk> <unk> an indonesian schoolteacher who had joined the group after finding tan online
the venue was <unk> modest apartment in a middle class singapore neighborhood
in june two thousand and fourteen one of <unk> hometown newspapers the independent dubbed him singapore's intrepid haze fighter
but pm haze with ten active members and no outside funding is well behind many established advocacy and research groups that fight air pollution elsewhere in asia
in new delhi the center for science and the environment has proposed specific ways that the government could tackle air pollution for example by cracking down on open fires
and in beijing the institute of public and environmental affairs is promoting a pollution monitoring mobile phone app as a way of ramping up pressure on polluting companies
by his own admission tan has very little experience in the non profit sector
he told me that he has no plans to pressure the government or companies into action at least not yet
for the moment he said pm haze is simply trying to learn about the problem in all its complexity and then communicate its findings to the singaporean public
in early november two thousand and fourteen the group developed the content for an <unk> haze exhibition in singapore that drew an estimated eight hundred visitors
and in the longer term tan said they would like to film a documentary in indonesia
my personal goal is to stop haze by two thousand and twenty three he added casually
that could be a pipe dream
but according to wilson ang assistant director for sustainability at the singapore institute of international affairs the haze of june two thousand and thirteen made the singaporean public much more involved in the issue
along with pm haze the episode spawned the creation of the haze elimination action team another grassroots community group
both groups have since gone on site visits to indonesia opened <unk> with palm oil companies and offered feedback or recommendations to singaporean officials
such a ground up approach is very much welcomed by the government said ang
haze however is still a growing public health concern for many countries especially lower income ones
we put a lot of legislation in place to control point sources and still when you add it up ambient conditions don't get better said jacqueline <unk> chief scientist at the united nations environment program
other challenges she told me are linking air pollution data with research on impacts and holding governments accountable for enforcing pollution laws
more than ever air pollution is a prominent target of policy reforms and public health interventions
many lower income countries grappling with the environmental and health consequences of their booming populations are tightening air pollution standards
international aid and development agencies are also rolling out projects to monitor or regulate particulate emissions
in southeast asia haze has recently <unk> on asean's political radar
in early july two thousand and fourteen officials from riau province announced that they would conduct a large scale compliance audit of local officials and <unk> companies linked to peatlands
on august five singapore's parliament passed a law that allows the government to fine both domestic and international companies up to two million dollar singapore for causing or contributing to haze
and on sixteen september indonesia's parliament finally <unk> asean's two thousand and two trans boundary haze agreement after twelve years of resistance
also that summer a senior adviser to joko jokowi widodo then indonesia's president elect said the new administration planned to renew the two thousand and nine indonesian law that banned peat burning when it expires in two thousand and fifteen
widodo himself said he planned to streamline land governance by creating a one map <unk> policy
the haze is caused both by the people and also the companies he told the straits times a singapore newspaper in late august
if we have good tough law enforcement then it can be resolved
how significant are these developments
in conversations with several haze watching analysts across south east asia i heard a wide range of opinions
some like helena <unk> aren't especially optimistic mainly because indonesia and asean have so far made so little progress on the haze problem
neither the singaporean law nor the regional haze agreement they pointed out would be <unk> in indonesian courts
and if climate change increases the number of <unk> and <unk> around the world as many scientists predict it will the incidence of <unk> fires may also rise and pose additional enforcement challenges
but others said it is positive that the indonesian and singaporean governments are at least taking action the sort that could breathe new life into existing indonesian laws designed to tackle haze
the recent political activity gives them hope that annual peat fires will not become southeast asia's status quo for future generations
jokowi did say that he aims to take action against the haze said tan yi han the haze fighter
that's just words but it's better than nothing
rep. elijah cummings said that clinton agreed to testify before the committee investigating the two thousand and twelve terrorist attack in december after he contacted her months earlier
the chairman asked me back in september to inquire as to whether secretary clinton would testify cummings said
she immediately said she would and that she wanted to come in december but if december did not work she would come in january
she said i'll do it period
the fact is she was very clear
she did not hesitate for one second
the u.s. consulate in libya was attacked on sept. eleven two thousand and twelve
four americans including the u.s
ambassador to libya chris stevens were killed
initially the attack was thought to be perpetrated by an angry mob responding to a video made in the u.s. which mocked islam and the prophet mohammed but was later determined to be a terrorist attack
nick merrill the former first lady's spokesman declined to go into detail about why clinton agreed to testify and when she might do so
i'm going to leave it to the committee to address their plans said merrill
in the past cummings has publicly resisted calling clinton to testify before the committee
the maryland congressman said in december that he agrees with other democrats who say they don't see why she should be called
cummings comments on tuesday however revealed the clearest indication to date that clinton was willing to show up before the committee though many details remain to be agreed upon and the appearance could well never happen
while touring the country selling her new memoir in june two thousand and fourteen clinton was asked whether she would be willing to testify before the house committee
we'll see she told nbc in an interview
i'm not going to <unk> it
clinton added that she took a lot of notes during the attack but declined to say whether she would hand over the notes
let's see if it's on the level or not
i don't want to be part of anything that in any way <unk> or <unk> the sacrifice that we saw happen there clinton said
the attack has remained a political issue for clinton who was secretary of state at the time since two thousand and twelve
as the former first lady eyes a potential presidential bid a number of republicans have signaled that benghazi will be a main line of attack against clinton
sen. rand paul has said the attack should <unk> clinton from higher office
rep. trey gowdy the chairman of the benghazi committee told reporters on tuesday that he still intends to have clinton testify as part of the investigation
every witness who has relevant information needs to be talked to he said
but gowdy is only prepared to hear from clinton thirty days after receiving all the state department documents on the attack including notes and emails from clinton
we intend to access all of the information necessary to do the job the house instructed us to do gowdy said in his opening statement at a committee meeting on tuesday
and we need to access that information now
talking to only some of the witnesses will not work
accessing only some of the documents will not work
if you want all of the truth you need all of the information
republicans have been long urging gowdy to call clinton to testify
stop hillary pac an anti clinton group delivered more than two hundred and sixty four thousand signatures to the committee in september two thousand and fourteen urging gowdy to subpoena hillary in order to uncover the truth about benghazi and subsequent cover up by the then secretary of state and president barack obama
democrats say that gowdy and other republicans have let politics seep into this investigation from the start and decided to call clinton only after receiving the stop hillary pac signatures
but a statement from the <unk> spokeswoman calls that into question
chairman gowdy has always said we look forward to the secretary's appearance as soon as practical after state produces documents response to committee requests said amanda <unk> <unk> spokeswoman
clinton testified for more than five hours before another house committee investigating benghazi in january two thousand and thirteen shortly before she left the state department
at the time clinton acknowledged a systemic breakdown but said that her department was taking additional steps to increase security at u.s. diplomatic facilities
since then clinton has said her biggest regret a during the four years she served as america's top diplomat was the benghazi attack
my biggest regret is what happened in benghazi clinton said in january two thousand and fourteen
it was a terrible tragedy losing four americans two diplomats and now it is public so i can say two cia operatives
as <unk> <unk> the president of the american arab anti discrimination committee noted there have been hundreds of violent messages on facebook and twitter directed against arabs and muslims made by people who had seen american sniper
for example tweets such as great f movie and now i really want to kill some f <unk> nice to see a movie where the arabs are portrayed for who they really are <unk> scum intent on destroying us and american sniper made <unk> muslims one million x more
being of arab heritage and muslim i had to know
did the film really portray arabs and muslims in way that would naturally draw these types of hateful comments
was the film a <unk> jubilee like a top gun for a new generation but where the muslims arabs are now the evil empire instead of the soviet union
what did i find
the film was not any of those things
american sniper is the most powerful anti war film i have ever seen
true the film is based on the autobiography of chris kyle the decorated navy seal sniper who recorded the most kills in u.s. military history
that fact is likely the reason some on the right have championed the film as a pro war anthem
but american sniper is becoming as misunderstood as bruce <unk> classic song born in the <unk> republicans from ronald reagan on have played that song at their campaign events believing it to be a pro america celebratory anthem
it's anything but that
the lyrics of born in the <unk> <unk> criticize the vietnam war and the way our country treated its veterans after their return to the states
many didn't listen to the words and so missed <unk> point
it's like this with american sniper
the film does more than portray the horrors of war
that we have seen before
instead it focuses on the horrors that come after
the post war suffering when those who have served come home
director clint eastwood gives us a parade of veterans who have been wounded in some fashion
lost legs lost arms lost hands lost souls
even veterans who appear intact at first glance turn out to be far from it
for example one scene features a veteran in an auto repair garage back in the united states
he recognizes kyle and after speaking to him for a minute raises his <unk> leg to show he is missing a leg
it's not surprising eastwood would make an anti war movie
the usually tight lipped eastwood recently commented contrary to public opinion i <unk> violence
and eastwood has not only publicly opposed to the iraq war he even questioned waging the war in afghanistan
as to my original reason for seeing the film to learn whether it <unk> hatred of muslims and arabs
well i don't think you are going to like our communities more after seeing the film
but i'm fairly confident that those who made hateful comments about arabs and muslim hated us before they stepped into the movie theater
the film just gave them an excuse to voice their bigotry
it's important to note
kyle was not killed by an iraqi but according to police by a u.s. veteran who allegedly had ptsd
it happened long after he'd returned from the battlefield
he was back home
if people are angry with that or about the fate of the other americans who suffered in the war they should focus should not on american muslims but on those who led our country into a war based on questionable reasons
that doesn't mean i don't wish eastwood made a more balanced film that would let audiences see the brutality and suffering of both sides in the conflict
there isn't any reference for example to the horrors of abu ghraib prison where u.s. soldiers infamously tortured iraqis
nor was there any reference to the two thousand and six massacre in <unk> iraq which happened during the period kyle was in iraq
that's when u.s. marines went on a killing spree and slaughtered twenty four unarmed iraqis including women children and an elderly man in a wheel chair
and <unk> depiction of the iraqis was almost <unk> without <unk>
forget character development
the iraqi version of kyle for example a sniper known as <unk> barely registered as one dimensional
he didn't even speak
he was simply depicted as a silent killing machine
was <unk> use of an almost video game like violence when it came to killing iraqis calculated to <unk> the iraqi people
i don't think so
his focus was not on whom we were fighting but the <unk> high price americans pay for waging war regardless of its target
the film is a cautionary tale for americans about why we must avoid war
it is not a celebration of waging it
while american sniper did garner an oscar nomination for best picture eastwood was not nominated for best director
but eastwood deserves a special award for making a powerful anti war film that the right would cheer
the philippines department of social welfare and development has confirmed that three hundred and forty members of one hundred homeless families were removed from roxas boulevard a major manila <unk> and temporarily relocated to a beach resort about ninety kilometers away for the duration of the papal visit
the families returned after the pope's departure
a resolution before the philippines house of representatives has called on the government to summon the head of the dswd for a probe into whether ninety seven thousand six hundred dollar spent on the six day training course at the resort in <unk> <unk> amounted to a misuse of public funds
rep. terry <unk> one of the lawmakers behind the resolution said in a statement he was concerned that the families had been rounded up from roxas boulevard which the papal convoy traveled several times during the pope's january fifteen nineteen visit
he said the episode highlighted the frivolous manner in which the government implemented anti poverty programs
the training course at the resort had been been funded as part of a program with the objective of keeping families off the streets by training them how to live in a house read the resolution which was also sponsored by rep. antonio <unk> and rep. <unk> <unk>
however after the papal visit the families who participated in the training were returned to the streets raising questions about the program's effectiveness in terms of its supposed objective of reducing poverty said the resolution
in an unrelated senate hearing tuesday dswd secretary <unk> <unk> was asked about the issue and confirmed that homeless families from the boulevard had been sent to the resort
she said the department had already intended to enroll the families in the training program and had considered the period of the pope's visit would be the ideal time to do so
to prepare for pope francis arrival
local governments wanted to make sure that roxas boulevard was in a secure and safe state and so were the people
with the influx of people in the area she told the hearing
so when we reached out to the families on roxas boulevard since we were already planning to register them to the modified <unk> cash transfer program we thought it could be the right time to hold the orientation from january fifteen to nineteen
the government's modified <unk> cash transfer program is described on a government website as a complete package of assistance to street families
with access to social services and economic opportunities for the improvement of their living conditions
<unk> resolution alleged that the resort stay was not the first time that dswd made an attempt to cover up the massive inequality in the country
it claimed that during the world economic forum on east asia held in manila in may last year families were relocated to another resort for similar training
the plight of the poor particularly street children was a <unk> during pope francis visit to the predominantly catholic country
at a sunday mass the pope embraced former street children who asked him why god had allowed them to suffer
she lacked the capacity to celebrate as russian troops in their long coats and fur hats plowed through the snow covered landscape into the massive camp
rena was emotionally numb intellectually bewildered and physically <unk>
at that moment she could hardly imagine that the madness that had destroyed her family and community could suddenly be lifted that life could somehow return to a <unk> of <unk>
liberation simply allowed her to ease her focus on immediate survival and begin a long search for understanding
in the days leading to liberation she and her mother <unk> had hidden under the wooden <unk> of a <unk> as nazi guards evacuated the camp forcing prisoners on death marches and shooting those who could not march
she had witnessed <unk> skeletal figures inhaling their last breaths <unk> upon each other in a pile of death
she had <unk> mourning for her little brother <unk> who had been <unk> four months earlier
one had to endure with <unk> since any show of emotion could <unk> a deadly beating or a bullet to the head
she had lived under a cloud of uncertainty and fear wondering what had become of her father who had also been imprisoned in auschwitz all as she suffered from tuberculosis and malnutrition
the russian red army may have have physically liberated rena but mentally she remained imprisoned still feeling that she was surrounded by death
the coming days brought a series of <unk> events rather than celebrations
the russians handed the children <unk> prison uniforms which they had never worn in camp
rena put the uniform over her gray <unk> dress then marched with the other children by the barbed wire as a russian camera crew filed the scene
this would become an iconic film clip documenting the liberation but one that spread the false idea that all auschwitz prisoners wore such <unk> uniforms when in fact they were for slave laborers who worked in <unk> <unk> outside the camp
on the train ride with her mother and aunt <unk> back to their hometown of <unk> <unk> in central poland people <unk> oh the jews are back
too bad hitler didn't kill you all
then shoved <unk> and <unk> off the train
the holocaust was over but hate remained very much alive
it was not until four decades later that the day of liberation would come to be a celebration of sorts
rena her cousin <unk> and a small group of child survivors gathered on january twenty seven one thousand nine hundred and eighty five to celebrate what they determined was their common birthday the day they were reborn to have a second chance at life
for each year afterward the child survivors would meet for a weekend around january twenty seven to celebrate their <unk> share cake flowers and good wishes but also to reflect discuss study and help each other face the trauma they had endured
enough time had <unk> that they could then confront the nightmare
study and reflection is exactly what the united nations intended for this date when in two thousand and five the international body declared january twenty seven to be international holocaust <unk> day
the u.n. urged
member states to develop educational <unk> that will <unk> future generations with the lessons of the holocaust in order to help prevent future acts of genocide
today there are numerous deeply meaningful <unk> that are of great benefit to students of all backgrounds
just as my mother and her child survivor friends sought understanding as they tried to come to terms with the unimaginable students around the globe must be engaged in education about the holocaust and the lessons it holds for humanity because tragically the liberation of auschwitz failed to deliver an end to terrorism and genocide
the world continues to suffer from too much hate driven violence from this month's terror attacks in paris to <unk> in syria darfur rwanda and <unk> all case studies that the lessons of the holocaust seventy years on remain as relevant as ever
they still must be taught more widely disseminated and never forgotten
this is a day not merely to commemorate but to educate
islamic law generally forbids men from touching women to whom they are not related
however that rule is often times overlooked when official diplomatic delegations visit the kingdom
the white house notes that representatives of the united states including former secretaries of state hillary clinton and <unk> albright along with german chancellor angela merkel have all visited the saudi king and have all shaken hands with members of the saudi royal family
islamic experts also point to another central theme of islam
hospitality
when one is a guest in someone's home they are treated as family
obama also did not cover her head <unk> strict religious and cultural customs in saudi arabia where women wear a full body garment called an abaya and cover their heads with a hijab or the more conservative niqab which has only a <unk> for the eyes
obama's predecessor laura bush also did not cover her head during her two thousand and seven solo visit to saudi arabia and neither did hillary clinton during a two thousand and ten trip to the kingdom as secretary of state
another former secretary of state <unk> rice also did not cover her head as she joined the u.s. delegation in saudi arabia on tuesday
but the u.s. state department advises other american women visiting the country that they could face problems if they don't cover their heads
women who choose not to conform to this dress code face a risk of confrontation by <unk> and possible detention arrest the state department says on its website
while most incidents have resulted only in inconvenience or embarrassment the potential exists for an individual to be arrested physically harmed or deported
additionally female tourists who don't abide by the dress code or sidestep other religious laws like walking in public <unk> or mingling with men who aren't relatives risk being harassed pursued or assaulted by saudi citizens the state department warns
pool reporters traveling with the president on air force one also pointed out that in the receiving line at the airport in saudi arabia a more open setting than the palace michelle obama stood next to but slightly behind the president and held a small black <unk> purse in front of her with both hands
reporters say they noticed that mrs. obama waited for a gesture to be made to her by the men who walked by and if the man initiated a handshake she smiled and shook their hand
if not both she and the man <unk> smiled and nodded heads
perceived problems of etiquette have come up before with the first lady
in two thousand and nine during her first meeting with queen elizabeth in britain she drew headlines when she hugged the monarch
british <unk> picked up on the embrace and some noted that etiquette wasn't followed because people aren't supposed to touch the queen
however other outlets quickly noted that the queen returned the hug

president obama has had his fair share of criticism as well
critics took issue when he bowed in front of saudi king abdullah at a g twenty meeting in two thousand and nine and again for bowing to the japanese emperor <unk>
although aides at the time told cnn on condition of anonymity that it wasn't a bow
he <unk> his hand with two hands and he's taller than king abdullah
former vice president dick cheney was one of obama's most vocal critics and said an american leader should never bow to anyone
however a state department spokesperson at the time told cnn that it's a natural response of the president the first time he meets the japanese head of state to show a sign of respect
obama defends saudi relationship
sometimes we have to balance
in an affidavit unsealed in federal court on monday the justice department accused evgeny buryakov also known as <unk> of posing as a russian banker in manhattan to <unk> economic intelligence to the svr russia's foreign intelligence agency
two other russians igor sporyshev and victor podobnyy were ostensibly diplomats in russia's un mission in new york but are accused of being <unk> svr handlers
while buryakov was operating deep undercover and therefore had no diplomatic protection the other two have immunity and have already left the the united states
anecdotes in the affidavit portray the accused spies as <unk> and hapless compared to the stereotype of hard eyed soviet era kgb professionals
still news of their <unk> comes at the most perilous moment in u.s. russia relations in decades with barack obama and vladimir putin at a standoff over issues ranging from ukraine to moscow's claims it has a right to a sphere of influence in its backyard
a spy operation will only serve to deepen the hostilities
professor mark <unk> a specialist in <unk> organized crime security affairs and russia at new york university said that russian operations are cranking up against the u.s. and its european allies
it is clear that this is a process that has been taking place over time he said
it is not just about throwing money and people into it
it is the <unk> and the <unk> that is at the height of cold war levels

russian spies used tickets and hats to try to hide new york activities
edward lucas author of deception
the untold story of east west espionage today said russian espionage in the west is on a bigger scale than it was during the soviet period
we are an open society so we are very easy to spy on and we are in competition with a very closed society which is russia
they use intelligence as one of the most important tools in the kremlin tool kit
more than two decades after the presumptive end of the cold war russian spies continue to seek to operate in our midst under cover of secrecy u.s. attorney <unk> <unk> said in a statement
assistant fbi director <unk> coleman warned that despite the collapse of the soviet union espionage is as pervasive today as it has ever been
this case is especially egregious as it demonstrates the actions of a foreign intelligence service to integrate a covert intelligence agent into american society under the cover of an employee in the financial sector he said
the affidavit contains details of alleged and apparently <unk> attempts by the accused svr agents to recruit female students at a new york university and a <unk> american businessman dreaming of riches in the russian energy industry
those <unk> bits have sparked <unk> assessments of moscow's espionage prowess echoing the ridicule drummed up by the outing of anna chapman in two thousand and ten
she was exposed in an fbi probe into ten russian deep cover sleeper agents and was later exchanged with moscow in a spy swap
according to the unclassified affidavit the two thousand and fifteen spies like the two thousand and ten brigade appeared to extract little useful intelligence and appeared not to penetrate deeply into the u.s. financial industry
in fact the two alleged handlers were caught on an fbi surveillance tape complaining that life as a spy in the united states wasn't like it was in the movies
podobnyy is quoted in the affidavit as saying that he didn't expect to be james bond but had expected a little more excitement
of course i wouldn't fly helicopters he said but confessed he had expected to pretend to be someone else under an assumed identity
the pair apparently communicated with buryakov using covert and coded methods and conducted forty eight clandestine meetings unaware they were under surveillance by the fbi
lucas said that in retrospect their missions might look <unk> but all espionage operations look brilliant if they succeed and <unk> if they fail
close observers of the spy trade argue that media mockery over chapman now a tv star and model in russia and her apparently unsuccessful comrades in new york <unk> from a long term well financed and painstaking effort by moscow and putin a former kgb agent to insert illegals deep into western society
peter earnest a former cia case officer who now heads the international spy museum in washington said that a perception had grown that those swept up in the two thousand and ten operation were part of a hapless keystone cops operation
the russians under putin have chosen to invest a lot of money into placing people like that overseas he said
it wasn't clear to the public what these people were doing
they were meant to be sleepers earnest said
typically an illegal sent to another country is a sleeper
he or she is available to handle a very sensitive asset or in the case of wartime or some sort of confrontation be available
while the agents exposed in new york this week were not sleepers they were also evidence of a comprehensive russian espionage program
the latest national threat assessment by director of national intelligence james clapper warned last year that russia in addition to challenging u.s. cyber security was also seeking to target u.s. personnel with access to sensitive computer network information
he named russia and china as the biggest threats to u.s. state security and said they were seeking data on advanced weapons systems and information on u.s. firms and research institutions that deal with energy finance the media defense and dual use technologies
john <unk> who spent a decade with the national security agency working as an intelligence analyst and <unk> officer on eastern europe and the middle east believes the u.s. russia spy wars are as vibrant as ever
this is the tip of an iceberg he said
the two thousand and ten illegals program that was rolled up by the fbi was a big success but this was not the end of it
<unk> said that since the demise of the soviet union russian intelligence services have rebuilt overseas networks partly to wage economic war against the west
such an emphasis is increasingly important at a time when the united states and its allies are imposing economic sanctions on powerful figures and top firms over russia's annexation of crimea and alleged infiltration into eastern ukraine
the new russian intelligence offensive has a world of opportunity
russian businesses and capital are increasingly important to and invested in the global economy
and the <unk> between vast russian commercial and energy interests and organized crime offers a <unk> world where spies can prosper
the affidavit in the buryakov case alleges that the svr sought to use an official russian news organization in the united states to get information about high frequency automated trading systems used on wall street and to gauge interest among brokers about russian products
while it lays out a comprehensive legal case against the three alleged russian spies the document also includes several intriguing story lines and leaves key questions unanswered in the fog of the espionage wars
the document includes <unk> of conversations between podobnyy sporyshev and buryakov not just from phone taps but from what it says are discussions inside the svr <unk> office
that leaves open the possibility that the fbi managed to get some kind of bug into the super secure premises
lucas said its mention may be intended to induce paranoia among russian intelligence chiefs who may wonder what other sensitive conversations were swept up
the document also says that in the summer of two thousand and fourteen buryakov met numerous times with a confidential source working for the fbi
that revelation may also lead svr bosses to question the extent of fbi knowledge about their operations
another question is why did the fbi move now
arresting a foreign spy is the last option you would rather turn them or watch who they are taking to said <unk>
why did they decide to arrest this guy
did they think they would be about to return to russia
was it because there was a risk that he was going to stumble across something important
was it time to put a shot across the russian <unk>
the idea that the united states wanted to make a political point about its intelligence operations at a time of rising tensions appears supported by the robust language of the department of justice press release
we will use every tool at our disposal to identify and hold accountable foreign agents operating inside this country no matter how deep their cover said attorney general eric holder
<unk> added
new york city may be more hospitable to russian businessmen than during the cold war but my office and the fbi remain vigilant to the illegal intelligence gathering activities of other nations
melissa mccarthy who was already in talks for one of the leads has signed on for the paul <unk> directed reboot and the studio is now negotiating with kristen <unk> as well as saturday night live players <unk> jones and kate <unk> the hollywood reporter has learned
negotiations are ongoing but the quartet are expected to sign on as the specter seeking <unk> punishing and phantom <unk> <unk> in the reboot which is eyeing a summer shoot in new york
mccarthy and <unk> have worked with <unk> before both breaking out with the <unk> <unk> comedy
female <unk>
why studios want more women led blockbusters
jones who is currently on screen in chris <unk> top five joined <unk> early last year and this fall was promoted to feature player status
<unk> has been on <unk> since two thousand and twelve and last year was nominated for an <unk> for her work
the <unk> reboot has seen a long development process
original director ivan <unk> was on board to return but while original <unk> dan <unk> harold <unk> and ernie hudson had agreed to <unk> their characters bill murray proved elusive
then <unk> bowed out of the project when <unk> passed away last year
<unk> was then approached to direct and <unk> the project as a reboot starring an all female cast
<unk> is <unk> by <unk> <unk> <unk> entertainment and <unk> <unk>
jones is <unk> by <unk> and integral <unk> while <unk> is <unk> by <unk> and <unk> young entertainment
<unk> confirmed the information in a tweet showing images of the four women
first as a child prisoner of just four years old
he has only fragments of memories from his time here
staring out at barbed wire running down concrete stairs hiding in a corner
and one especially vivid memory that still <unk> his dreams the bloodied face of an elderly man
last year he visited the german nazi run concentration camp as a survivor
he came for closure and says he felt an overwhelming sense of relief
during the seventy year memorial for the liberation of auschwitz on tuesday he visited the camp in search for his identical twin brother separated shortly after liberation
sometimes i stare at people in the street and i look for someone who looks like me he said
my biggest hope is my brother will be here
maybe from another country
or maybe another survivor can tell me something recognize me or remember us both
anything
but as he stands in the snow next to the barbed wire and the brick buildings his heart pounds
he turns away to hide his tears
seventy years ago menachem <unk> was known as elias <unk> auschwitz id a seven thousand seven hundred and thirty three
auschwitz records show he had a twin <unk> <unk> a seven thousand seven hundred and thirty four
both were subjected to the medical experiments of nazi doctor <unk> mengele
and both survived auschwitz to be taken into a care home for children after liberation
but elias was adopted by a man searching for his own wife and children in the chaos and eventually taken to israel
he was given the new name of menachem <unk>
what happened to <unk> <unk> is unknown
for decades menachem didn't even know he had a twin
his only memory came to him in the form of dreams of another boy blond like him sleeping in bed beside him
it took nearly seventy years and the help of his <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> over documents for him to prove his instinct was real
in one sense she says his lack of memory is a blessing
i'm really happy for him that he lost his memory
she told cnn it's so much easier to establish a normal life
but even then he had nightmares
just imagine if he remembered
but it means she must rely on the memories of other survivors to try and track down his twin
it's all about the awareness of friends and neighbors
and courage
if he's there and he knows about the search he'll need some courage to come forward and then he'll find he has a wonderful family
menachem has launched a facebook page titled a seven thousand seven hundred and thirty four in the hope that social media will spread word of his search
there has been progress
a dna match found <unk> first cousins in the united states the only relatives from his birth family
they had no idea that menachem was alive and had assumed that he and his entirely family had <unk> in auschwitz
it was an emotional reunion and his cousins gave him a gift
the only photo of his birth parents
they told me so much about my mother he says smiling
the most important thing
now i know my mother's face
before i had remembered only her blond hair
now i can see her
but he still searches for <unk>
and he comes to auschwitz in the hope he will remember some clue another survivor will recognize him
maybe even his own brother
he says he has new dream now
he sees himself walking in a forest with his brother wearing identical clothes black trousers and a short sleeve blue shirt
is it a dream or does he believe it will become a reality
maybe i don't know
he says
but standing in the snow outside the very building he was held as a prisoner as a young boy menachem insists he has not given up
no not at all
he says it only makes me want to search for him even more
in auschwitz the place of his nightmares menachem still finds hope to dream
and yet for them it will be so much more
for ferguson a missouri native it'll be a chance to thank his father bill the man who never stopped fighting for him while he spent ten years behind bars for a crime he didn't commit
being able to do this with my father after all he's done for me sacrificing ten years of his life to prove my innocence that's when it became real said ferguson
the father son pilgrimage came about last month when a ticket distributor who had heard about his story offered ferguson an all expenses paid trip to sunday's game
the thirty year old who now lives in florida was released from prison in two thousand and thirteen
ferguson's twelve year nightmare began on november one two thousand and one
he and his friend charles erickson both then seventeen were drinking illegally at a college bar in columbia missouri
about five blocks away columbia tribune sports editor kent <unk> turned off his computer after a long night and left the newsroom shortly after two a.m. according to court documents
in the newspaper's parking lot someone struck <unk> from behind and <unk> him with his own belt
police interviewed a <unk> jerry trump who said he couldn't identify the people involved in the slaying
but two years later erickson told police he had dream like memories of committing the crime according to court documents
ferguson told police that he remembered driving erickson home before going home himself
but after erickson implicated him and trump changed his account ferguson was charged with murder and convicted in two thousand and four
when <unk> father bill ferguson <unk> the day after his son's arrest he was devastated
oh my god i got to get to work his father now seventy recalls thinking
it's like watching one of your children drowning
i had to do something
i started reading the police reports over and over said the real estate agent
i made a timeline and flow chart of all the <unk>
i started questioning people on my own and i dug up a lot of witnesses
each week ferguson's father visited his son in the maximum security prison where he was held
they would share updates compare notes and work on the case together
ferguson served a quarter of his forty year sentence while his family and friends campaigned to free him
after two key witnesses admitted that they had lied a court of appeals overturned his conviction in november two thousand and thirteen and ferguson walked free
erickson is serving a twenty five year sentence in a missouri prison
no one else has ever been charged in the case
can you imagine wiping out everything you did in your twenty s
ferguson said
that's what it is like
after he was freed ferguson did not feel safe in his hometown
the case had gotten a lot of attention locally and a lot of people knew who he was
ferguson said he feared the legal system which had put him an innocent man in prison
i love columbia missouri he told cnn
if it wasn't for the authorities i'd go back
while in prison he worked out religiously and began writing his first book about physical fitness
upon getting out he moved to florida became a certified personal trainer and earlier this month published stronger faster smarter
a guide to your most powerful body
the crazy thing is i saw him more when he was in prison said his father bill ferguson who still lives in missouri
he's been incredibly busy
we get together around once a month
football has always been a way to bring the father and son together
i played football in college and high school
he was brought up on it bill ferguson said
it's a vernacular for us a way for us to get together and have something to talk about
for the elder ferguson the best part of the super bowl trip will be getting to spend a few days with his son
we'll get to watch one of the greatest sports possible and we'll get to spend a lot of time just the two of us together said his father
ram <unk> co founder of texas based golden tickets had watched cbs's forty eight hours special about ferguson a few years ago
in november he saw a follow up about ferguson being released from prison and wanted to do something nice for him
whatever cost we <unk> it's worth it <unk> said
he's got an amazing attitude
after talking to him a number of times i can't wait to meet him
it took <unk> about a month of trying to connect with ryan ferguson on facebook and other channels before his offer was taken seriously
it seemed like one of those things that were too good to be true said ferguson
in my life i've learned to leave things alone that are too good to be true
cnn first learned of the news from freelance writer paul <unk> who uploaded the story to cnn ireport
at first ferguson didn't have much of a reaction to the super bowl offer
the excitement joy and happiness didn't hit until i talked to my dad he said
we were screaming on the phone <unk>
while ryan doesn't have a super bowl favorite he's just excited to see amazing people do amazing things his dad is rooting for the seattle seahawks in their matchup with the new england patriots
when we were in seattle we were so impressed with their spirit said bill ferguson referring to a trip in two thousand and fourteen
it'd be difficult for us not to be supporters
the father and son will spend a long weekend together <unk> in football fandom and their shared bond
and making up for lost time
being locked up for ten years meant no college and i never even sent a text or posted a facebook update or used a smartphone ferguson told <unk> paul <unk>
i will get to go to the super bowl with my dad
it's a dream come true
this is a golden opportunity and one that i will never ever forget for the rest of my life

all four teams had a chance of qualifying before kick off with senegal requiring just a point to be sure of their passage to the next stage
however a two zero defeat at the hands of algeria coupled with ghana's late two one win over south africa ensured alan <unk> men would not be progressing from group c

algeria had the chance to open the scoring after just ninety seconds but a terrible touch from <unk> <unk> when through on goal allowed senegal goalkeeper <unk> <unk> to <unk>
the pre tournament <unk> would not have to wait long to break the <unk> however
aided by some <unk> defending <unk> <unk> controlled a simple ball over the top before <unk> himself and calmly <unk> beyond <unk>
algeria was dominant and <unk> <unk> took his turn to test <unk> with a <unk> shot from distance after twenty minutes
<unk> had warned his players before the game that nothing was settled despite their advantage atop the group
and as the half wore on the <unk> side began to edge their way into the contest
<unk> <unk> <unk> the palms of <unk> <unk> in the algeria goal with a long range effort as halftime approached
yet senegal looked vulnerable on the break when pushing forward
this pattern would come to define much of the second half
senegal brought on newcastle striker <unk> <unk> as they searched for an equalizer and they made early headway as <unk> <unk> almost latched on to a <unk> <unk> <unk>
algeria <unk> this early pressure and came close to doubling their advantage after seventy three minutes
<unk> <unk> strike from the edge of the area beat <unk> but not kara <unk> who had fallen back to station himself on the line
ten minutes later though there was nothing <unk> or his defenders could do as <unk> <unk> found himself free on the edge of the senegal area
the tottenham midfielder composed himself and fired an unstoppable shot into the bottom right hand corner to make sure of the victory and top spot in the group
algeria's triumph meant ghana required a win over south africa in <unk> to <unk> senegal in the standings and book their place in the quarterfinals
but things didn't start too brightly for the black stars as <unk> <unk> broke the <unk> for south africa with a stunning volley after fifteen minutes
aware that two goals were required ghana poured forward but were faced with a <unk> bafana bafana rear guard
john <unk> restored <unk> after seventy three minutes <unk> on to a <unk> andre <unk> shot before <unk> to <unk> beyond <unk> <unk>

convening a rare press conference on tuesday at church headquarters in salt lake city mormon leaders pledged to support anti discrimination laws for gays lesbians <unk> and transgender people as long the laws also protect the rights of religious groups
in exchange the mormon church wants gay rights advocates and the government to back off
when religious people are publicly intimidated <unk> against forced from employment or made to suffer personal loss because they have raised their voice in the public square donated to a cause or participated in an election our democracy is the loser said elder <unk> <unk> a member of the church's <unk> of twelve <unk>
such tactics are every bit as wrong as denying access to employment housing or public services because of race or gender
the mormon church is one of several faiths to complain about religious freedom coming under attack in recent years
catholic bishops and southern <unk> have sounded the alarm as well
it is one of today's great <unk> that some people who have fought so hard for lgbt rights now try to deny the rights of others to disagree with their public policy proposals said <unk>
tuesday's announcement doesn't change church doctrine including its opposition to gay marriage mormon leaders said
but we are suggesting a way forward in which those with different views on these complex issues can together seek solutions that will be fair to everyone said elder d. todd <unk> a member of the <unk> of twelve <unk> one of the church's top <unk> of leadership
<unk> said tuesday's announcement came after years of dialogue with lgbt groups in utah and elsewhere and was timed to the convening of a new congress and new legislative sessions nationwide
it seemed like the right time to speak before positions get any more hardened on either side he said
shortly after the church's press conference u.s. sen. orrin hatch a utah republican and a mormon said he will work to ensure that legislation designed to promote greater equality includes robust religious exemptions and <unk> provisions
utah state sen. jim <unk> who is openly gay said <unk> to the church's historic announcement
i am proud that the <unk> church has seen fit to lead the way in non discrimination he said
now let's roll up our <unk> get to work and pass a statewide <unk> bill
<unk> however said it's unfair to characterize the church's announcement as a national <unk> campaign
mormon leaders are merely seeking to square competing claims of gay rights and religious liberty he said in a brief interview on tuesday
the human rights campaign a national lgbt advocacy group said some mormons may consider their church's announcement symbolically significant
but as a matter of public policy it appears deeply flawed said <unk> legal director sarah <unk>
doctors <unk> and business owners would still be allowed to discriminate against gays and lesbians as long as they cited a religious reason she said
on the other end of the spectrum southern baptist leader russell moore called the mormons new policy well intentioned but naive
proposals to balance gay rights and religious freedom inevitably lead to attacks on the latter moore said
officially known as the church of jesus christ of latter day saints the mormon church like other religious groups has tried to strike a delicate balance on gay rights
mormons have fought the legalization of same sex marriage for example while trying to avoid the anti gay label sometimes <unk> to conservative faiths
many church members were particularly <unk> by the fierce backlash to prop eight
the mormon backed referendum was later struck down in court
nearly two thirds of mormons say homosexuality should be discouraged by society according to a two thousand and twelve survey conducted by the pew forum on religion and public life
the church's official position is that same sex attraction is not a sin but acting on it is
at the same time mormon leaders have taken an increasingly civil tone towards gays and lesbians in recent years and gay rights groups cheered the church for endorsing the boy scouts decision to allow gay scouts in two thousand and thirteen
notably however mormon leaders said tuesday that they would not and could not alter their opposition to gay marriage calling such unions contrary to the laws of god
this <unk> and doctrine comes from sacred <unk> and we are not at liberty to change it said sister <unk> <unk> a leader in the church's women's organization
but god is loving and <unk> <unk> continued
jesus <unk> to marginalized <unk> she said by way of example while also <unk> religious commandments
it's for this reason that the church has publicly favored laws and <unk> that protect lgbt people from discrimination in housing and employment
in two thousand and nine the mormon church backed <unk> regulations for gays and lesbians in salt lake city
on tuesday mormon leaders said they are now willing to support similar measures elsewhere including laws protecting lgbt persons from unfair bias in housing unemployment and public transportation
with nearly six point five million members in the united states the mormon church is one of the largest in this country to offer support of lgbt anti discrimination laws second only to the united methodist church
the country's two largest christian <unk> the catholic church and southern baptist convention have opposed the employee non discrimination act or <unk>
none of those groups <unk> gay marriage
in this country less than a third of states have laws protecting gays and lesbians from discrimination according to glad a gay rights group
even fewer state laws protect gender identity or expression
it is unlikely that mormons support of those measures could increase that number significantly except perhaps in church strongholds like utah idaho and wyoming
there are sixteen mormons in congress where lgbt civil rights legislation including <unk> has repeatedly failed
gay marriage has proved far more successful than anti discrimination laws despite opposition from conservative groups including the mormon church
thirty five states now allow same sex couples to <unk>
earlier this month the supreme court agreed to decide whether states have the constitutional right to ban same sex marriage
perhaps with an eye on the high court mormon leaders said tuesday the rights of gays and lesbians must not trump the religious freedom of faith communities
what kinds of religious rights are we talking about
said elder jeffrey holland a member of the church's <unk> of twelve <unk>
it begins with the rights of faith communities to <unk> their beliefs from the <unk> teach them in church classrooms and freely select their own leaders and ministers holland said
but religious freedom should also extend to mormon physicians who refuse to perform abortions or artificial <unk> for a lesbian couple or a catholic <unk> who declines to carry the morning after pill he added
as mormon leaders acknowledged tuesday such situations have perplexed politicians appeared on court <unk> across the country and set conservative and liberals at fierce odds
these are serious issues holland said and they require serious minds engaged in thoughtful <unk> discourse

once again i'm sorry
he wasn't alone

government officials face a tough dilemma
they don't want to shut everything down keeping children home from school and people home from work but they also do not want to risk a disaster
look at what happened in atlanta when the city wasn't prepared frank flores said in a facebook discussion
he was referring to an incident a year ago this week in which people were stranded along miles and miles of icy <unk> <unk> the metro area for more than twenty four hours
many ultimately abandoned their cars and walked home
there's some hand <unk> over the forecasting models used
here's the basic idea from cnn meteorologist brandon miller
meteorologists largely depend on three major forecast models
the <unk> the <unk> and the <unk>
meteorologists will look at all of these and using their own expertise local knowledge etc
<unk> a forecast
in this case the <unk> and the <unk> both showed two feet of snow or more for new york city while the <unk> showed a more conservative six to twelve inches
the national weather service forecasters in new york certainly went all in with the <unk> and <unk> forecasts and all but ignored the <unk> without providing much room for uncertainty that should come with the <unk> showing a vastly different solution
still the forecast wasn't too far off if you look at it as a whole miller says
the heaviest snow fell across much of connecticut rhode island long island and massachusetts
winds have <unk> up to hurricane strength which was also in the forecast
predicted storm surge flooding also came to fruition he said
but of course the headlines are going to come from new york city and new jersey where a forecast of more than two feet turned out to only be about half that miller said
there were two feet of snow elsewhere and a miss of only thirty to forty miles in a forecast that was first given forty eight hours in advance is not that bad from a strictly forecasting perspective
but from a practical perspective it's a big miss and has major ramifications with business disruption wasted resources and tax dollars etc
miller said
cnn did note the discrepancy among forecasts monday even as government officials were announcing closures
i just got the brand new models in just a minute ago
and one model says for new york city two inches not two feet two inches
the other model i looked at said twenty seven inches cnn meteorologist chad myers noted
i hate it when models don't agree to that extent
it's not an exact science and it's important for people to know that miller says
as meteorologists we must convey the uncertainty associated with these forecasts
opinion
weather forecasts are always going to be uncertain
two deaths were reported both in new york
there has been one widespread power outage reported in massachusetts
as of tuesday night close to four thousand eight hundred flights were canceled in the united states with the largest number of cancellations at <unk> newark philadelphia and jfk airports according to flight aware
here's a look at some of the latest developments in states hit by the winter storm

it is ironic that a drone could strike down near the white house as one did monday morning since the issue of drone strikes is one that will follow president barack obama and mark his legacy
after the crash near his temporary home obama called during an interview with cnn's fareed zakaria for more drone regulation
the drone that landed in the white house you buy in radio shack obama said
but when historians talk in the future about drones and the obama white house they won't be referring to be the two foot long quad copter that was discovered on the southeast corner of the white house grounds and sent washington into a security related <unk> early monday morning but rather to the unmanned aerial vehicles the pentagon calls them uavs like the one that was confirmed on monday by the u.s. government to have delivered its payload in yemen
the strike acknowledged monday is one of more than five hundred that have been launched by the united states since two thousand and eleven according to data compiled by the new america foundation
three officials told cnn's barbara starr about the drone strike in marib yemen which was conducted by the cia
the agency declined to comment although starr reported that it is not believed any major aqap leaders were targeted
this is the first u.s. drone strike of the year in yemen and the first since a popular uprising in yemen has <unk> the government that has so far cooperated with the u.s
in its anti terror campaign
the new america foundation has sought to keep a tally of u.s. led drone strikes in pakistan and yemen
the use of drones peaked in pakistan in two thousand and ten and in yemen in two thousand and twelve according to their data
it was in two thousand and ten that the department of justice lawyers wrote a secret memo for the obama administration that argued extra <unk> killings of people suspected of being terrorists was justified under u.s. law even in the case of u.s. citizens thought to be plotting abroad
that memo or two thirds of it that were not redacted were released by a federal court last june in the face of a lawsuit by the <unk>
clearly there's a huge difference between the type of drone used by the military to target and kill suspected terrorists and the type of drone used to take video with a gopro
somewhere in between is the type of drone also in the news drug smugglers are now using to carrying drugs across the southern border
<unk> police said last week they <unk> a drone carrying six pounds of synthetic drug crystal meth that crashed into a super market parking lot because six pounds worth about forty eight thousand dollar according to the dea was too much weight for the drone to handle
a spokesman for u.s. customs and border patrol said u.s. authorities have not yet encountered a drone as part of the war on drugs
but they do use drones of their own to monitor traffic on the southern border for undocumented crossings
in addition to drug smugglers legitimate businesses want to use drones too
farmers are using them
jeff bezos wants amazon to use them although it's a little unclear how that'll work out

amazon's drone delivery
how would it work
colin <unk> who is ceo for three d robotics testified about research into the commercial use of drones jan. twenty one on <unk> hill
he did so with a small drone about the same size as the one that crashed near the white house hovering next to him
there were snickers when the drone briefly crashed in the hearing room
all of this is in the way of saying drones are taking on an increased importance in the u.s. economy and becoming more visible in the nation's airways
the federal aviation administration has issued some guidelines restricting where and how users can fly drones but the industry is largely unregulated as more companies look to buy and integrate the relatively new technology into their business
the faa had set a september two thousand and fifteen deadline to roll out a list of drone regulations
obama noted the need for more regulation during his interview with cnn's zakaria
you know that there are companies like amazon that are talking about using small drones to deliver packages
there are incredibly useful functions that these drones can play in terms of farmers who are managing crops and conservationists who want to take stock of wildlife
obama said
but we don't really have any kind of regulatory structure at all for it
the station was <unk> one of the uk's leading radio stations and the topic in question was british actor benedict <unk> use of the term colored during his appearance on the <unk> smiley show on pbs in the united states
the uproar that has ensued has left me slightly perplexed
cumberbatch was discussing with smiley the inequality of roles for black actors in the uk and the frustrating lack of opportunities for them a subject that is close to my heart
in doing so he mistakenly used an <unk> term to describe his fellow colleagues in their struggle
i am and have been offended by the term when it has been used towards me and i don't ever want to be described by this word one that is rooted in an abhorrent period of history in many countries and has connotations that were intended to offend
it of course later became the politically correct term du <unk> before finally being <unk> from common <unk> for good
but wait
my yelling at the radio this morning comes from a place where i find myself wondering
why are we choosing to lose the nuances here
are we more comfortable with <unk> the bigger picture behind an admittedly mistaken use of a word than we are with receiving the actual message that the <unk> was trying to offer a very necessary message about injustice and inequality from someone who cared enough to voice it
isn't there a space to explore intent in a person's actions even when it comes to use of language that can offend
can our racial debates simply be reduced so easily to black and white good or bad
my slight connection with cumberbatch is that we were once facebook friends
we are loosely connected through industry friends and some of them are of color
so for my part i see an actor who was on <unk> important show who was trying to stand in unity with his fellow actors about an issue that has mostly been highlighted by those of color within the entertainment industry
i am one of those industry members
i have never understood issues of any kind of prejudice and inequality to be anything other than a problem for all of society
the idea that we can <unk> certain groups to the margins <unk> any potential they may bring to the mainstream seems a foolish lack of <unk> in understanding that such prejudice harms society as a whole not only those <unk>
and in my opinion to change endemic injustices requires a holistic approach one that calls on all areas of society to come together to demand change
so when an actor like cumberbatch takes on questions of inequality and is not simply pulled up and corrected but has his whole background and character <unk> for using a word of outdated terminology in spite of the greater message in his words are we not responding with the very same prejudice that we have used to label him
are we not also terrifying others who may wish to speak out on the same issues
won't they keep quiet for fear they may make a mistake under the pressure of an interview and the importance of the subject and find their message lost
i myself have struggled in interviews to ensure my message is not lost in the split second use of an incorrect word
the word has too much meaning and history for me as a black woman but it is possible for others who are nervous and under the pressure of concerns to get it right to become confused and use the term colored in place of people of color when wishing to embrace black and other non white ethnic groups
it's not correct but it's possible to make the mistake with the best intentions of trying to <unk> all <unk> who encounter racism but in the end i feel we all lose out if we dwell on the nave use of a word and become deaf to a message
we make mistakes
but isn't it time we started to have more nuanced discussions on race where heart and intent are taken into account allowing us to concentrate on the very real battles we face to eliminate the existence of racism from all elements of our world

obama keeps the lights on bulb bright ideas
the centers for disease control and prevention say those kinds of bugs kill twenty three thousand people a year in the united states and cause two million <unk>
obama wants to ramp up research efforts at government agencies looking into how bacteria grows immune to widely used antibiotics and supporting scientists developing new drugs
experts say a rise in bugs that aren't stopped by drugs presents one of the biggest public health threats to the united states
the problem they say originates in overuse of widely available antibiotics some of which don't require a doctor's prescription
researchers are also probing the links between superbugs and the widespread use of antibiotics in livestock
obama signed an executive order in september that established an inter agency task force charged with developing a government strategy for superbugs and set reduction goals for the numbers of drug resistant infections each year
the white house's budget request heads to capitol hill on feb. two
despite pleas by human rights groups and legal representatives who have argued that hill's intellectual disability should have made him <unk> for the death penalty hill died by injection at the prison in jackson georgia
his time of death was seven fifty five p.m
et said spokeswoman <unk> hogan
hill declined to make a final statement but requested a final prayer hogan said
hill's attorney slammed the u.s. supreme court which declined to step in and grant a stay of execution
today the court has <unk> allowed a grotesque <unk> of justice to occur in georgia said brian kammer hill's lawyer
the intellectual disability community which has strongly supported mr. hill's case for many years joined his legal team in the belief that the supreme court would step in and prevent georgia's <unk> disregard of the constitution on behalf of the rights of people with disabilities said kammer
he described the execution as an <unk>
the georgia state board of <unk> and <unk> similarly voted to deny clemency
the board said in a release that its members thoroughly reviewed the parole case file on the inmate which includes the circumstances of the death penalty case the inmate's criminal history and a comprehensive history of the inmate's life to reach their decision
in a joint statement released tuesday the naacp the georgia council on developmental disabilities and <unk> for alternatives to the death penalty called the board's decision to deny clemency an embarrassment to our state
they condemned the legal system for failing to protect those who are most vulnerable
the groups invited those concerned about georgia's criminal justice practices to join them at <unk> in several cities around the state before hill's scheduled execution
federal law stemming from a two thousand and two virginia case that went to the u.s. supreme court says executing intellectually disabled individuals violates the eighth <unk> ban on cruel and unusual punishment
but the ruling also allows states to define intellectual disability
in georgia that means attorneys for death row inmates have to prove mental impairment beyond a reasonable doubt
this is the <unk> standard in any jurisdiction in the nation kammer said
hill's execution comes two weeks after the state executed andrew <unk> a vietnam war veteran suffering from post traumatic stress disorder who killed <unk> county deputy kyle <unk> in one thousand nine hundred and ninety eight
kammer also was <unk> counsel
kammer who has represented hill for twenty years said in any other state hill would have served a life sentence
hill was sentenced to death in one thousand nine hundred and ninety for killing fellow prison inmate joseph <unk> beating him to death with a nail <unk> board
at the time hill had been serving a life sentence for the one thousand nine hundred and eighty five shooting death of his girlfriend <unk> wright
we acknowledge that mr. hill should be held accountable for his actions and behavior <unk> <unk> president of the arc of georgia said in a letter written on hill's behalf
however it is our contention that mr. hill who has an intellectual disability should not be subject to capital punishment
the arc is a nonprofit organization that advocates for and serves people with intellectual and developmental disabilities
hill had the support of the american association on intellectual and developmental disabilities the georgia naacp and former president jimmy carter and his wife <unk> carter
the victim's family and former jurors had also expressed support for mercy in hill's case saying they weren't given the option of life without parole when sentencing him to death
kammer had said seven doctors agreed that his client was intellectually disabled including three doctors for the state who initially evaluated hill and said he didn't meet georgia's standard
kammer said those doctors have since signed an affidavit admitting they felt rushed during hill's examination and now believe he does meet the standard for intellectually disabled
in previous clemency hearings attorneys for the state have argued that hill served in the navy held a job and managed his money before killing his girlfriend signs that he didn't necessarily meet the legal standard to be considered intellectually disabled even though he has a low iq
but kammer said examples of hill achieving self <unk> don't make a strong case for his execution
hill has an iq of approximately seventy and the emotional and cognitive ability of a young boy according to his attorney
several of the letters supporting hill's clemency cited last year's supreme court decision that struck down a florida law that used <unk> standards for determining intellectual disability for death row inmates
attorneys tried to use the hall v. florida decision as grounds to spare the life of georgia inmate robert wayne <unk> who was sentenced to death for the murder of a local sheriff's deputy
<unk> who also had an iq of seventy was executed in december
hill declined to request a special last meal the department of corrections said
he was offered the institutional meal tray consisting of <unk> pie <unk> potatoes red beans <unk> <unk> salad <unk> sugar cookies and fruit punch
it is the second purported message from goto in four days
if authentic it is the first time isis is publicly linking the fates of goto and the captive jordanian pilot moaz al kassasbeh whom isis captured after his jet crashed last month in syria
the latest file posted to youtube and distributed on social media by known isis supporters appears to show a static image of goto alone in handcuffs and wearing orange holding a picture of who appears to be al kassasbeh
over the image a voice purporting to be goto's <unk> saturday's apparent isis proposal
goto would go free if jordan releases longtime prisoner sajida al rishawi
this time it's still a one for one swap but now both the lives of goto and the jordanian pilot are threatened if it doesn't go through
cnn can not independently verify the authenticity of tuesday's message
i've been told this is my last message and i've also been told that the barrier <unk> my freedom is now just the jordanian government delaying the <unk> of sajida the voice says in english in tuesday's post
tell the japanese government to put all the political pressure on jordan
her for me a straight exchange the voice says
any more delays by the jordanian government will mean they are responsible for the death of their pilot which will then be followed by mine
i only have twenty four hours left to live and the pilot has even less
the nearly two minute video posted tuesday morning et makes no mention of releasing pilot al kassasbeh even if al rishawi is released
the video is similar to a post from saturday which alleged that isis had killed a different japanese hostage haruna yukawa
saturday's post shows a static image of goto holding what appears to be a photo of beheaded compatriot <unk>
a voice purporting to be goto's says that yukawa was killed because japan hadn't answered a previous isis demand of two hundred million dollar for the japanese captives freedom
saturday's voice also said that the captors no longer demanded money but rather a goto for al rishawi swap
japanese prime minister shinzo abe said sunday that experts were analyzing saturday's video but that it seemed highly credible
u.s. authorities said they had no reason to doubt its authenticity
abe on wednesday morning told reporters in tokyo that he was angry about the ongoing situation
under very severe circumstances i instructed yet again that the government work together as one towards the immediate release of mr. goto he said
al rishawi is an iraqi woman facing the death penalty in jordan for her role in a series of bombings that killed dozens of people at hotels in the arab kingdom in two thousand and five
authorities said she tried to take part in the massacre but her explosives failed
militants say they captured al kassasbeh the jordanian pilot after he ejected from his crashing f sixteen last month having taken part in u.s. led coalition airstrikes near isis de facto capital raqqa syria
jordan is participating in an american led mission against isis an organization seeking to establish a caliphate or islamic state and has <unk> territory spanning from central syria to about one hundred kilometers north of baghdad
goto forty seven and yukawa forty two had gone to the middle east for different reasons the former is an experienced freelance journalist covering the conflict in iraq and syria and the latter an aspiring security contractor who felt at home in the war torn region
they ended up in the hands of isis in recent months

barcelona has already been hit with a transfer ban after <unk> regulations when signing young players but rival real insists it has <unk> fully with fifa's rules when conducting its own under age deals
real said it has shown extraordinary diligence during the transfer and registration of the fifty one cases of foreign minors that are being investigated
the spanish club issued a lengthy statement confirming the governing body's request for documents relating to the various deals taking place over the last five years though it did not name any of the players
real madrid defends the protection and the correct and healthy development of minors via its strict adherence without exceptions to the regulations on the status and transfer of players and is in complete agreement with such investigations being carried out to this end the statement read
article nineteen of fifa's regulations prohibits the transfer of players under the age of eighteen unless they meet one of three qualifying criteria
under age players can move to a club in a different country if their parents move there for non <unk> reasons if they are from another nation within the european union or european economic area and aged between sixteen and eighteen or if they live within one hundred km of the club
real provided explanations for each of the fifty one cases stating that the majority of players were exempt from regulations for various different reasons
among the exemptions it provided were that ten players were spanish nationals twenty three foreign players had previously been registered with other spanish clubs six players were eighteen or over at the time of their registration two players had never belonged to madrid and one player appeared twice on fifa's list
real also offered up further explanations for the remaining nine cases
real madrid has responded <unk> supplying all the information required by the committee within the established <unk> and in complete documentary detail added the real statement
both real madrid and the <unk> royal spanish football federation through which the informative investigation is being processed have been left totally satisfied with the information supplied and have verified the strict adherence to the registration regulations in absolutely every case
madrid director <unk> <unk> had earlier confirmed monday that fifa is investigating the club but is confident there is nothing to worry about
we are in agreement with fifa in this matter and we will continue collaborating with them in everything that is asked of us he told reporters
we are absolutely calm about how real madrid has proceeded
madrid who sit top of the spanish la liga completed the signing last week of sixteen year old norway international martin odegaard from norwegian club <unk>
speaking at a news conference in paris french interior minister bernard cazeneuve said a new blow has been dealt to terrorism with the arrests in the <unk> region
police units carried out an early morning raid in in the small town of <unk> overseen by the anti terror branch of the paris prosecutor's office
five men aged between twenty six and forty four were arrested and remain in police custody
law enforcement <unk> also conducted several searches
according to cazeneuve the five men are suspected of active participation in a jihadist thread whose members were recruited and <unk> and then themselves recruited and <unk> several french young people from <unk> as well
<unk> <unk> <unk> a spokeswoman for the paris prosecutor told cnn that two men out of the five are suspected to have traveled to syria two others were allegedly planning on traveling there
it's too early to give out any further information she said
cazeneuve emphasized the <unk> of the men's alleged jihadist ties
if the involvement of the suspects is confirmed by the courts a seriously dangerous and organized cell will have been dismantled this morning he said
yet another one
it's been almost three weeks since two gunmen attacked the french satirical magazine charlie hebdo killing twelve people and another gunman shot a policewoman in a paris suburb and killed four hostages in a kosher supermarket
since then authorities in france and elsewhere have cracked down on suspected radical islamists with links to the paris attackers or to terror networks overseas
cazeneuve on tuesday reiterated the full mobilization and determination of french authorities to fight against terrorism both inside and outside the country
over the past year he said more than ten young men have left their hometown of <unk> for syria where they joined the ranks of isis
several of them have died in fighting in syria or iraq
in total seventy three french nationals have died under the same circumstances he said
but even as the u.s. works closely with the saudis on common strategic goals like counterterrorism obama said he and his administration continue to apply steady consistent pressure on issues like human rights
obama is headed to saudi arabia to meet the new king salman and pay his respects following the death of king abdullah last week
sometimes we have to balance our need to speak to them about human rights issues with immediate concerns that we have in terms of countering terrorism or dealing with regional stability obama said in an interview with cnn's fareed zakaria in india on tuesday
during his visit tuesday obama will make paying respects the bigger priority avoiding directly answering a question from zakaria on whether obama would discuss with the saudis the case of the political activist and blogger who was sentenced to twenty years in prison and one thousand lashes for his activism
related
what to expect when obama visits saudi arabia
and obama was candid that u.s. pressure to advance human rights or encourage political reforms isn't always appreciated and oftentimes that makes some of our allies uncomfortable
it makes them frustrated he said
and you know some of them listen and some don't obama said
in the list of those who don't obama recalled the unraveling of the egyptian dictatorship of hosni mubarak the former president of egypt who was overthrown in egypt's two thousand and eleven revolution
mubarak was one of the u.s.'s closest allies in the region during his three decades in office thanks in large part to a strong security agreement and mubarak's work to maintain peace with israel
obama said that he warned mubarak that the massive protests in tahrir square were not simply going to vanish urging mubarak to get out in front of reform and become the father of the egyptian democracy
i said mr
president i don't think this is a <unk> that you can put back in the bottle obama recalled
he said ah mr. president you don't understand society here
this is all going to be fine
it'll blow over
and it didn't obama said
but the <unk> is one that i will sustain throughout the rest of my presidency and that is to make an argument to those friends and allies of ours that if they want a society that is going to be able to sustain itself in this age then they're going to have to change how they do business obama said

auschwitz where more than one million jews roma poles soviet prisoners of war and others were killed
but as horrific as they were they were only three camp <unk> in a system of more than eight hundred and fifty ghettos concentration camps forced labor camps and <unk> camps that the nazis established during the twelve years <unk> hitler was in power
by the end of world war ii in one thousand nine hundred and forty five the death camp system stretched from france and the netherlands in the west to estonia <unk> and poland in the east
there were twenty main concentration camps many of which had many <unk> according to geoffrey <unk> the editor of the u.s
holocaust memorial museum's <unk> of camps and ghettos
many of them combined the most <unk> and degrading characteristics of prison and slave labor camps
in some nazi doctors carried out <unk> experiments while others were primarily transit camps places to hold jews and other <unk> until they were sent to other camps
there were also four main <unk> camps <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> devoted solely to killing everyone who passed through their gates
<unk> nearly <unk> auschwitz in the sheer number of people who were murdered there
between eight hundred and seventy thousand and nine hundred and twenty five thousand people were killed at <unk> in poland one hundred and seventy thousand died at <unk> at least one hundred and fifty two thousand were murdered at <unk> and about four hundred and thirty four thousand five hundred jews were killed at <unk>
in all about six million jews and millions of others died in the holocaust
but the exact numbers of dead will probably never be known nor will the total number of people held prisoner in nazi camps
the nazis were famously good record keepers but they managed to destroy the records of some camps before the allies liberated them
the infamous <unk> <unk> camp which like auschwitz had elements of both concentration camp and <unk> camp was one where records were destroyed
about eighty thousand to one hundred and ten thousand people died in the main camp but it's impossible to know how many prisoners it held in its time
bergen <unk> was another camp whose <unk> erased as much history as they could
historians may never determine how many prisoners the camp held in its time but it's clear that about fifty thousand people <unk> there including anne frank who died of disease mere weeks before the camp was liberated
in a <unk> statement litvinenko blamed russian president vladimir putin for ordering his poisoning by tea at a london hotel
the kremlin has always strongly denied the accusation
sir robert owen who's chairman of the inquiry said tuesday that sensitive material relating to possible russian state involvement in litvinenko's death would be heard behind closed doors
the british government initially rejected requests to hold a public inquiry but the decision was reversed last summer after litvinenko's widow marina litvinenko challenged it in court
she argued that a public inquiry would enable the fullest possible investigation
an inquest a coroner led investigation that is held as a matter of course in the case of unnatural deaths in england had been opened after her husband's death
but unlike a public inquiry it can not hear evidence behind closed doors
in alexander litvinenko's case such evidence could involve matters of national security
the issues to which his death gives rise are of the utmost gravity and have attracted worldwide interest and concern owen said
litvinenko a former kgb agent and fierce critic of putin came to britain in two thousand after turning whistle <unk> on the fsb the <unk> successor
he died at a london hospital on november twenty three two thousand and six after being poisoned by the radioactive material polonium two hundred and ten while drinking tea at the millennium hotel in london's <unk> square
uk prosecutors have asked for the extradition of two men <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> from russia in connection with litvinenko's murder
but moscow has refused saying russia's constitution does not allow the extradition of russian citizens
both men deny involvement in litvinenko's death
owen said that <unk> and <unk> had been invited to give evidence to the inquiry by video link from russia and that he hoped they would do so
the public inquiry will look at possible russian state involvement in litvinenko's death
however it will not address the question as to whether the uk government could or should have taken steps to prevent the murder
litvinenko is said by his widow to have been a british agent with a handler at mi six britain's foreign security service
in two thousand and twelve the counsel to the inquest hugh davies said evidence provided by the uk government showed russian involvement and does establish a <unk> <unk> case as to the <unk> of the russian state in the death of alexander litvinenko
the inquest has been put on hold while the public inquiry is held
owen the coroner in the inquest said the open hearings in the inquiry should conclude before easter
that is early april

after the rocket fire officials evacuated israeli controlled areas around mount <unk> site of a ski resort the military said
the lebanon based militant group hezbollah is suspected to have been involved in the rocket attack which came from a syrian air base in an area controlled by the syrian army with a known hezbollah presence an israeli military source said on condition of anonymity
hezbollah supports the syrian regime which has been battling sunni islamist militants and other rebels in a civil war for more than three years
weapons fire from syria into israeli controlled golan heights both targeted and <unk> the israeli military contends has happened intermittently in the past year as the syrian civil war raged
more than a week ago iranian <unk> media reported that an israeli airstrike killed six hezbollah members and a senior iranian commander in the syrian controlled portion of golan heights around the syrian town of quneitra the site of the only border crossing between israel and syria
iran like hezbollah supports the syrian regime

why the iran sanctions fight is a big deal
i'm sure that while we're there they'll touch on some of the leading issues where we cooperate very closely with saudi arabia ben rhodes obama's deputy national security adviser told reporters on monday
on the list of issues that could come up
the campaign against isis in iraq and syria and the deteriorating government of yemen where rebels thought to be supported by iran have overthrown the president
saudi arabia is also the world's second leading producer of crude oil and plays a key role in setting global oil prices
i think they'll touch on those issues and it will be a chance for us to make sure that we're in good alignment going forward where we have <unk> interests rhodes said
leaders from britain france japan and russia also made trips to riyadh saudi arabia's capital to meet with salman in recent days
white house press secretary josh earnest said on monday that obama's schedule in riyadh is still being worked out
obama is also facing pressure to raise human rights issues with the country's monarch
saudi arabia imposes strict restrictions on women requiring them to have male guardians and forbidding them from driving
the country has also made headlines recently for its media restrictions
blogger raif badawi recently faced a sentence of one thousand public <unk> and ten years in prison for insulting the country's clerics
human rights is a topic that we raise regularly with saudi arabia so generally that is something that is on our bilateral agenda rhodes said
without knowing exactly what the extent of the meetings and consultations will be and what the precise agenda will be i can't speak to individual cases he said
but i think it will certainly be the case that human rights will be on the agenda with saudi arabia going forward and we raise these types of individual case with saudi arabia on a regular basis
obama defends saudi relationship
sometimes we have to balance
but remaining relatively <unk> for all those years has had an unintended effect on this two hundred and fifty kilometer long four kilometer wide no man's land
home to five rivers and several mountains it's become a thriving natural habitat for thousands of plant and animal species
and if south korea has its way the dmz will eventually be transformed into an ecology peace park
the proposal is high on <unk> agenda at this week's <unk> convention an international meeting on <unk> taking place in switzerland
a korean delegation to the standing committee meeting of the <unk> convention will brief international organization officials about the dmz peace park plan to seek cooperation said an official of the ministry of unification the government office responsible for inter korean relations in a korea times report
it aims to broaden international support for the project added the official
apart from the thousands of soldiers stationed at the dmz the heavily fortified border is home to more than one thousand two hundred varieties of plants and thousands of animal species including endangered wildlife like the <unk> black bear and <unk> leopard
it's not the first time the idea to turn the dmz into an ecology park has been raised
the south korean government first introduced the plan in two thousand and thirteen
it brought it up again in an official statement in two thousand and fourteen saying the park could become a symbol of peace between the two <unk>
the <unk> ministry of unification even listed it as one of its new year plans for two thousand and fourteen
so why <unk> the international community's assistance
as the southern part of dmz is under the control of the united nations command it is important for seoul to gain global support for the dmz park plan reports the korea times
but the biggest challenge will be to persuade north korea to get on board with the plan
pyongyang has repeatedly rejected the idea dismissing it as an attempt to make money off tourists
the twelve years a slave actor said he was an idiot and devastated at his choice of words during an interview with pbs <unk> smiley about the lack of diversity in the british film industry
cumberbatch thirty eight told smiley
i think as far as colored actors go it gets really difficult in the uk and i think a lot of my friends have had more opportunities here in the u.s. than in the uk and that's something that needs to change
his comments were criticized by some observers on twitter as being insensitive and out of touch
one user called <unk> thomas asked
benedict cumberbatch used the term coloured to describe black actors
what year are we in
but smiley who is black defended the sherlock star on monday tweeting
those who saw benedict cumberbatch on pbs know he feels persons of color are <unk> in hollywood
the actor who appeared on <unk> show to discuss his oscar nominated role in the imitation game praised the efforts of lenny henry a black british actor and comedian who has launched a campaign to ensure more ethnic minorities are employed in the uk media
something's gone wrong we're not being representative enough in our culture of different races and that really does need to step up a pace cumberbatch said
it's clear when you see certain <unk> patterns that there are more opportunities here than there are in the uk
cumberbatch issued the following statement to people magazine on monday
i'm devastated to have caused offense by using this <unk> terminology
i offer my sincere apologies
i make no excuse for my being an idiot and know the damage is done
i can only hope this incident will highlight the need for correct usage of terminology that is accurate and <unk>
the most shaming aspect of this for me is that i was talking about racial inequality in the performing arts in the u.k. and the need for rapid improvements in our industry when i used the term
i feel the complete fool i am and while i am sorry to have offended people and to learn from my mistakes in such a public manner please be assured i have
i apologize again to anyone who i offended for this <unk> use of inappropriate language about an issue which affects friends of mine and which i care about deeply

opinion
cumberbatch <unk> now let's get over it and fight real prejudice
anti racism campaigners in the uk lamented <unk> use of the word as outdated but praised the actor for highlighting a very important issue within the entertainment industry and within society
the lack of representation of people from black and ethnic minority backgrounds within certain industries in the uk is an issue which needs addressing and we are pleased that benedict has spoken out in support of more appropriate representation and of the views of actors and campaigners like lenny henry a spokesperson from show racism the red card told cnn
in doing so he has also inadvertently highlighted the issue of appropriate terminology and the evolution of language
show racism the red card feel that the term coloured is now outdated and has the potential to cause <unk> due to the connotations associated with the term and its historical usage
appropriate terminology differs from country to country
for example we know that in some countries the term coloured is still widely used and that in the us the term people of <unk> is quite common

as contrasting as each <unk> is from the next all exhibit their watches behind shatter proof glass display cases mounted like priceless artifacts in a museum
being here is a reminder that fine <unk> is one of the few major industries where the dominating players have with only a few exceptions been in existence for more than a hundred years
swiss haute <unk> <unk> <unk> for instance was busy celebrating its two hundred and sixty th year of business
this heritage and the creation stories that surround it play an important role in both the design philosophy and marketing of the new ranges
it's not just important
it's fundamental
our heritage is the most significant element of our brand and without it we wouldn't exist anymore says angelo <unk> ceo of <unk> which was established in <unk> in one thousand eight hundred and sixty and built a name for itself manufacturing dive proof watches for the italian royal navy during the second world war
it's now positioned at the upper end of the market with most of their lines having strictly limited runs
but at the same time as <unk> in their past all the brands are locked in a technological arms race that inevitably <unk> them into the future
from high tech new carbon based materials to smart straps to a record breaking ultra thin <unk> this year's <unk> wasn't short on innovation
the stars of the show were those that successfully managed to integrate these astonishing <unk> of <unk> into <unk> that still manage to reach back to the past
this year <unk> continued to draw heavily on its sea <unk> roots with the <unk> <unk> one thousand nine hundred and fifty <unk> based on a sixty year old model originally created for italian commandos
<unk> is a new material made by <unk> sheets of carbon fiber with a polymer to form an ultra strong material that according to the company is ten times lighter than steel as well as being <unk> and <unk>
but it's <unk> natural variation in appearance that gives it a distinctive visual edge
the most import thing about the configuration of the material is that it allows us to present watches that are each different from the other because the stripes represented on the watch are never the same explains <unk>
one of the most technically flamboyant watches on display came from swiss based <unk> <unk>
in the making for over eight years the company drafted in an expert on <unk> instruments and an academic from the geneva <unk> who specializes in the psychology of perceived sound to create the royal oak acoustic research concept
the achievement here is a <unk> that <unk> the pleasing mechanical <unk> reminiscent of a grandfather clock into the miniature real estate of a <unk>
if they were alive and twenty five years old today they would be on the quest for the next holy grail says <unk> ceo franois henry <unk> of the two men who founded the company one hundred and thirty nine years ago
no matter how great their latest watch would be the day after they would already be on the next one
it has always been part of who we are
<unk> <unk> the market of ultra thin watches
at last year's <unk> they unveiled the world's <unk> mechanical watch and this year they set the record for the <unk> <unk>
the watch itself is eight point two four mm the movement is four point six five mm and has two hundred and forty components which by the way are thinner than hair beams <unk> charismatic ceo philippe <unk> <unk>
aside from this fairly astonishing technical achievement there's a refreshing simplicity about the watch's design
when you look at a watch you can't see all its internal complications
you just see something beautiful adds <unk> <unk>
unlike all the other swiss <unk> at <unk> who are based in the <unk> west <unk> has its <unk> in the north eastern city of <unk> close to the german border
this means there is a very <unk> approach to design
a very rational very pure and more technical aesthetic explains the company's director of design christian <unk>
with the <unk> annual calendar <unk> marks the seventy five th anniversary of its most popular portuguese range
as its name suggests the watch carries the <unk> first annual calendar displaying the month date and day in three separate semi circular <unk> around the twelve <unk> mark
the shade of deep royal blue on the dial i happen to think is particularly <unk>
once described by the british king edward <unk> as the <unk> of kings and the king of <unk> <unk> is today still most popularly known for its <unk> prowess
but since it recently started producing its own in house mechanical movements the <unk> french brand has made a mark in the <unk> world of haute <unk>
the <unk> de <unk> grande complication is <unk> most complicated watch to date
it's made up of five hundred and seventy eight components and takes fifteen weeks to create
it includes a perpetual calendar a minute <unk> and a flying <unk> and only needs to be adjusted once every one hundred years
but as technical as it is <unk> ceo <unk> de <unk> is keen point out that this is not a case of innovation for its own sake stressing that it has to be as beautiful on the inside as it is on the <unk> mechanical movement is always at the service of design
five foreigners one american one french citizen and three people from <unk> were killed in the attack <unk> al naas said
five libyans were killed

american contractor david berry was among the people killed in a terrorist attack at the corinthia hotel in tripoli libya on tuesday according to cliff taylor chief executive officer of <unk> a security firm where berry was working
the fbi is expected to open an investigation into the incident two u.s. officials told cnn
a state department official confirmed the death of a u.s. citizen but would provide no further information
a french citizen was among those killed according to the french foreign ministry
al naas earlier said at least two libyan security personnel had been killed in the attack and that three gunmen were holed up in the hotel
an online group that supports isis said the attack was carried out in the name of abu anas al libi
al libi was an alleged al qaeda operative accused of involvement in the bombing of u.s. embassies in africa
he was captured by u.s. special forces in libya
he died in a u.s. hospital this month
a spokesman for the corinthia group in <unk> told cnn there had not been a hostage situation in the hotel as some reports suggested
we are trying to take possession of the hotel back to assess the damage he said but libyan security forces were not yet allowing that
the attack began when militants detonated a car bomb in the parking lot of the hotel
the gunmen then shot their way into the hotel
guests were evacuated to safety however
the five star hotel is popular among government officials some of whom reside there
a witness to the events told cnn that all roads leading to the corinthia hotel had been sealed by security forces
people were warned to stay away the witness said adding that there had been exchanges of gunfire

indonesia's search and rescue agency <unk> will continue its work to try to retrieve bodies from the wreckage site in the java sea the head of the agency bambang soelistyo said wednesday
the military provided the majority of personnel and hardware involved in the recovery operation which was hindered by bad weather and technical problems
we are really disappointed imam <unk> whose four family members who were on the plane still haven't been found said of the military's announcement
we really hope the evacuation process is still going
<unk> said it would have sixty divers eight <unk> experts seven boats two helicopters and a fixed wing plane taking part in the continued search efforts which will resume saturday after the teams take a rest
flight qz eight thousand five hundred and one went down on december twenty eight as it flew from the indonesian city of surabaya toward singapore with one hundred and sixty two people on board
so far searchers have managed to recover seventy bodies from the sea leaving ninety two still unaccounted for
over the weekend navy divers tried to lift part of the fuselage of the plane using wire ropes and giant balloons
but the attempts failed after lines attached to the wreckage broke
an effort to lift a smaller piece of wreckage was also unsuccessful the military said
our main priority is to find the bodies
we are not going to focus on lifting the fuselage soelistyo said wednesday about the future search plans
the chief of the indonesian armed forces gen. <unk> on tuesday ordered the military teams involved in the operation to pull out said military spokesman <unk> <unk>
officials said that nineteen of the eighty one navy divers working on the recovery efforts had fallen ill with <unk> sickness and would be taken for treatment at a hospital in jakarta the capital
i told them safety first
but as we know soldiers they are always working hard to find the bodies said rear adm. widodo commander of the indonesian navy's western fleet
they are not thinking about safety but about doing their duty
the divers haven't been able to see any more bodies inside the wreckage of the fuselage widodo said
officials had previously suggested that many of the missing human remains might be found inside the fuselage
but widodo said some bodies could be trapped or hidden under wreckage on the seafloor
searchers have recovered at least fourteen bodies from the fuselage site including some that floated free during attempts to lift the wreckage according to officials
indonesian aviation investigators are still trying to establish why flight qz eight thousand five hundred and one went down in an area of heavy thunderstorms last month while other planes nearby completed their journeys safely
investigators are looking at whether the aircraft's flight <unk> computers played a role in what went wrong the news agency reuters reported tuesday citing two unidentified people familiar with the matter
the <unk> helps pilots with the stability and control of the aircraft keeping it on course at the proper altitude and making sure adjustments to the <unk> are smooth
it also warns pilots if they try to manually push the plane beyond its capabilities
flight qz eight thousand five hundred and one an airbus a three hundred and twenty two hundred had two <unk> one serving as a backup
indonesian officials have said the aircraft climbed rapidly before it fell into the water
the reason for the sharp ascent is unclear but aviation analysts say the <unk> could have recognized trouble and at a critical moment automatically shifted full control back to the pilots who may not have realized it amid the crisis
investigators have submitted their preliminary report into the crash officials said tuesday
but authorities have said they don't plan to release it to the public
indonesian transportation minister ignasius jonan told cnn on monday that the final report into the disaster should be published in less than a year
it won't be a year that's my promise he said
rozalia was living with her family in krakow when <unk> hitler's troops marched into poland in the fall of one thousand nine hundred and thirty nine
krakow was such a beautiful city before the nazis came
one of the most beautiful places i have ever known she remembers
over seven decades later <unk> memory is beginning to fade and she struggles to remember when exactly she was brought to auschwitz but she can not forget the day she arrived at the death camp
there were thousands of us squeezed into <unk>
auschwitz was very close to krakow but they drove us around for hours so we wouldn't know where we were she says
i remember it was dark but it looked like the sky was on fire
it was so bright
it was the gas chambers they made it look like the sky was burning rozalia remembers
the newly arrived prisoners had to take their clothes off and lie naked on the ground
then the selection process started
pregnant women children elderly people and anyone who was deemed <unk> for intense physical labor were sent directly to the gas chambers
they told us to go left or right
one direction meant life the other one meant death
i never knew which one i was going the ninety year old says
suddenly a colleague of her brother's was standing in front her
he was working at the camp
he recognized me and brought me some food
all of a sudden i realized i was naked
i was so ashamed i dropped the food
later he asked one of the ss officers to give me a pair of underwear
you can not imagine how cold it was
we were happy for every piece of clothing we were given
the prisoners at auschwitz were forced into excruciating physical labor beaten tortured and subjected to horrific medical experiments spearheaded by the ss captain dr. joseph mengele
many of those who were not sent to the gas chambers died of starvation and illness
an estimated one point three million people were deported to the concentration camp and over one point one million were killed out of which about nine hundred and sixty thousand were jews
we knew about the gas chambers
every few minutes they sent people to die
i always wondered when it was going to be my turn but i never gave up hope
giving up meant you were going to die but i wanted to live so badly she recounts her days at auschwitz
she says it was her incredibly strong instinct to live that helped her get through every day
even when they beat me i never cried
if they were going to kill me i did not want to give them the satisfaction of seeing me cry she explains
looking back rozalia says it is hard to put the feelings into words
prior to auschwitz she was in a krakow <unk> and the <unk> concentration camp nearby infamous for its sadistic treatment of prisoners
however nothing compared to the horrors of auschwitz she recalls
one can talk about it and talk about it but it is almost impossible to comprehend what a human being can endure and survive and what people can do to other people she explains shaking her head in disbelief
what kind of people are capable of doing this to other human beings
they must have had families and children themselves rozalia still wonders today
i think they forgot how to be human she adds
as allied forces started closing in on concentration camps in easter europe in one thousand nine hundred and forty four and one thousand nine hundred and forty five many prisoners were either killed or moved to concentration camps further west
in one thousand nine hundred and forty four rozalia was transported to bergen <unk> a concentration camp near <unk> germany
between one thousand nine hundred and forty four and one thousand nine hundred and forty five the number of prisoners at bergen <unk> tripled from around seven thousand three hundred to twenty two thousand according to the us holocaust memorial museum
many detainees were women one of them was rozalia and another one was anne frank
bergen <unk> became scene of sheer horror as the camp became increasingly <unk>
prisoners were starved for days clean water was barely available and diseases started to spread killing tens of thousands in the beginning of one thousand nine hundred and forty five alone
yet <unk> story of survival continued
on april fifteen th one thousand nine hundred and forty five <unk> ordeal ultimately came to an end when british forces liberated the camp
after the liberation rozalia first went back to poland then to israel
in one thousand nine hundred and forty eight she moved to germany
my husband fell ill and the best treatment was there she says to explain her move to the place that caused her so much pain in the past
rozalia lost her family and her youth in the holocaust but she never lost her will to live
maybe that is why i survived i don't know
i was also very very lucky
it was a miracle she says
after the war she has tried not to think about what she had to go through
life goes on you know she says
asked whether she would go back to see auschwitz today she said
my grandchildren have visited the museum at auschwitz
i wouldn't go back i have already been there

sexual assaults became a high profile problem in india after a young woman was gang raped on a bus in new delhi in two thousand and twelve
the victim later died
subsequent incidents of sexual violence including at the hands of an uber driver placed global scrutiny on india's laws and culture
obama traveled to india in the hopes of <unk> on the deep personal warmth he's quickly developed with the new indian prime minister narendra modi whose <unk> welcome for the american president was covered <unk> and <unk> by indian media
that's a distant cry from modi's arrival in the united states in september which was marred by awkward questions over his visa status
modi a member of the right wing hindu nationalist <unk> <unk> party had previously been denied entry to the u.s. for an alleged role in a massacre of muslims
obama said on tuesday it was the responsibility of every citizen to uphold the freedom of religious that's enshrined in india's constitution
every person has the right to practice their faith how they choose or to practice no faith at all and to do so free from persecution and fear obama said
obama's <unk> speech tuesday was one of his few moments apart from modi during his stay in india
the pair hugged upon obama's arrival <unk> tea and <unk> through a formal garden and sat for hours behind rain <unk> bulletproof glass reviewing the annual republic day parade
white house officials say the level of personal interaction between the leaders exceeded even their already high expectations and claim the relationship <unk> the way for progress on a civilian nuclear deal to allow u.s. firms to construct power plants in india
both sides also moved toward more defense cooperation and trade pacts
but despite their talk of cooperation obvious differences persist between the u.s. and india that could <unk> cooperation on areas like combating climate change
during his remarks tuesday obama said india must commit to reducing emissions that cause climate change even as the manufacturing and power plants that produce that pollution drive india to new economic heights
here's the truth
even if countries like the united states curb our emissions if growing countries like <unk> soaring energy <unk> also embrace cleaner fuels then we don't stand a chance against climate change obama said
<unk> susan <unk> apologized for the inadvertently <unk> gift the word for a watch or clock in chinese sounds like the end and many associate it with death
we learn something new each day
i had no idea a gift like this could be seen as anything other than positive
in the uk a watch is precious because nothing is more important than time she later said in a statement
but the recipient mayor <unk> <unk> je also came under fire for his rude response
<unk> who was recently elected and isn't a career politician told reporters that he had no use for the pocket watch
i can just <unk> it to someone or take it to a scrap metal dealer and sell it for cash he was quoted as saying
on tuesday he apologized and said he would undertake some diplomatic etiquette training
<unk> and <unk> can take comfort that it's not the first time an exchange of official gifts has stirred controversy
president obama was widely slammed by the british press in two thousand and nine when he gave then british prime minister gordon brown a set of dvds which did not play on the british system
brown's gift of a pen holder carved from the <unk> of a <unk> anti slavery ship seemed to be the more thoughtful half of the exchange
the same year the president obama raised eyebrows again when he gave queen elizabeth ii an ipod loaded with video footage of her visit to the united states in two thousand and seven
they once talked about going to a movie
but that was it
the reason for the puzzling behavior according to a federal complaint unsealed monday is that the men were russian spies exchanging intelligence information in new york city
they used tickets and other everyday objects like books <unk> and hats as part of their code
when they did meet on dozens of occasions between early two thousand and twelve and late two thousand and fourteen it was usually outdoors in order to lower the risk of surveillance
at the short meetings one man would hand a bag a magazine or a slip of paper to another
but the fbi was watching and listening to them
on monday in new york authorities arrested one of the men who they say had been working as a covert agent for the russian government
he was identified as evgeny buryakov thirty nine who posed as an employee in the new york city office of a russian bank according to the federal complaint
the man he met regularly for the <unk> was igor sporyshev forty who worked as a trade representative for the russian government in new york the complaint says
a twenty seven year old man serving as an <unk> to russia's mission at the united nations victor podobnyy is also alleged to have been part of the conspiracy
all three men are accused of working for russia's foreign intelligence agency the svr
sporyshev and podobnyy who no longer live in the united states and haven't been arrested both had diplomatic immunity because of their jobs for the russian government
but buryakov who entered the united states as a private citizen was operating under what officials called non official cover
agents like that known as <unk> generally receive less scrutiny by the host government and in many cases are never identified as intelligence agents by the host government a statement from u.s. law enforcement authorities said
as a result a <unk> is an extremely valuable intelligence asset for the svr the statement said
buryakov needed the other two men to get <unk> to and from the communications systems kept in the <unk> office in new york according to authorities
as he was undercover he couldn't go near the office
the subjects about which the men were tasked with gathering intelligence are believed to have included possible u.s. sanctions on russia and u.s. efforts to develop alternative energy resources
sporyshev and podobnyy also tried to recruit u.s. citizens as intelligence sources in new york the complaint said
their targets included people working for major companies and young women with ties to a major university located in new york according to authorities
the fbi says in its complaint that its surveillance of the men heard them discussing various aspects of their work
in one conversation podobnyy is alleged to have talked about his technique for recruiting sources which included cheating promising favors and then <unk> the intelligence source once the relevant information was obtained by the svr according to authorities
but in another discussion he apparently complained to sporyshev about how <unk> his everyday job was saying it was not even close to james bond movies
of course i wouldn't fly helicopters but pretend to be somebody else at a minimum he said
sporyshev seemed to <unk> <unk> i also thought that at least i would go abroad with a different passport
the two men also chatted about the two thousand and ten <unk> of a russian spy ring in the united states
in that case eleven intelligence personnel living and working in the u.s. as sleeper agents were arrested and later allowed to return to moscow as part of a spy swap
according to the complaint podobnyy suggested those agents couldn't do anything
they studied some people worked out some exits but they didn't get any materials he said
the fbi investigation into buryakov sporyshev and podobnyy began within a few months of the guilty pleas in the two thousand and ten case according to the fbi
a source working for the fbi met with buryakov in the summer of two thousand and fourteen posing as a representative of a wealthy person wanting to invest in the casino business in russia
over the course of the meetings buryakov demonstrated his strong desire to obtain information about subjects far outside the scope of his work as a bank employee authorities said
he also accepted documents that the source claimed had come from a u.s. government agency and purportedly contained information potentially useful to russia including information about united states sanctions against russia according to the u.s. law enforcement statement
prosecutors announced charges monday against buryakov sporyshev and podobnyy on two counts
the first is participating in a conspiracy for buryakov to act in the united states as an agency of a foreign government without first notifying the attorney general which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison
in the second count buryakov is charged with acting in the united states as an agent of a foreign government without first notifying the attorney general while sporyshev and podobnyy are charged with aiding and <unk> that offense
the maximum sentence for that count is ten years imprisonment
the charges and <unk> arrest make clear <unk> than two decades after the presumptive end of the cold <unk> spies continue to seek to operate in our midst under cover of secrecy said u.s. attorney <unk> <unk>
a federal judge in manhattan on monday ordered that buryakov be detained because he was considered to pose a flight risk the u.s. attorney's office said
his federal public defender <unk> <unk> spoke to the new york times
she declined to comment on the charges other than to say that she had argued for bail because buryakov was neither a flight risk nor a danger to the community the newspaper reported
the rush of fear and the brief re acquaintance with breakfast are part of the thrill
but when does a theme park ride stop being <unk> fun and start being just plain scary
we're talking about the rides on which the fear turns into the kind of pure psychological terror that only weeks of counseling or a night of <unk> can resolve
the rides on which it's not just breakfast that flashes before your eyes but your entire life
these are the scariest theme park rides on earth
thankfully we don't have to try them because stefan zwanzger aka the <unk> theme park guy already has
and lived to tell the tale
just when life in a totalitarian state couldn't get any more terrifying north korea <unk> some <unk> <unk> rides on its <unk> <unk>
to be fair the <unk> youth park is a rare attempt to <unk> genuine joy on the gray <unk> <unk> of pyongyang
the fear here says zwanzger is an emotional response in no way <unk> by geopolitics
when you visit north korea you naturally never feel completely safe and relaxed so you enter the rides wondering if they've been maintained at all since most were built decades ago
zwanzger's fear free alternative
<unk> has a relatively new italian made <unk> coaster
most ghost trains are so lame that it's interesting to hear of one that actually does <unk> its passengers
unfortunately at the time of zwanzger's visit this boardwalk ride on <unk> <unk> <unk> was getting its screams the lazy way
via pain
imagine you're alone in a ghost train driving through the dark and all of a sudden a sticky curtain drops on you from above and sticks itself to your nose and teeth zwanzger says
and while the ghost train keeps moving forward the curtain and your nose and teeth don't
zwanzger says he complained to the operator
due to the language barrier and the lack of any internationally recognized sign language for my nose got stuck to a curtain i don't think he got the message
i don't think he really cared about anything either
he adds
man that was painful
my love and pity goes out to those who ride it next
at iran's <unk> park it's a <unk> between which is more disturbing
the badly drawn <unk> mouse cartoons or the soda can roller coaster
for zwanzger the coaster which plays fast and loose with physics by <unk> passengers in a such a tight loop they can almost see the backs of their own heads wins
when i saw this the first time with coke can shaped cars <unk> <unk> around a narrow loop i thought that's going to hurt
and it did
two to three hours of neck pain followed
this roller coaster makes one of the <unk> <unk> known to mankind
it's as if your head stays in the same place while the coaster spins around
zwanzger's fear free alternative
skip roller iran's <unk> altogether and enjoy the country and its wonderful people
fill it with <unk> eyed couples and happy families
then crank the speed dial up to eleven
that's how they do it in nepal
because maybe when you live on the slopes of the himalayas gaining a few extra meters in height just isn't thrilling enough
that thing had speed says zwanzger who says he didn't board the wheel in <unk> fun park because the line was too long and he was afraid of being propelled into orbit
you could hear screams
and these were not the normal ferris wheel screams of <unk> let's take a photo
these were more like <unk> let me down i wan na get outta here screams
chairoplanes are called chairoplanes because as with chairs it's possible to sit in them and as with planes all logic says these things should not leave the ground
typically chairoplanes rise a few meters off the ground giving passengers a thrill as they ride in a chair or model aircraft attached by chains to a rotating overhead <unk>
at <unk> a new theme park in the chinese coastal city of <unk> the chairoplane ride is less chair more plane <unk> <unk> passengers up to almost cruising altitude
i was the only rider and once up in the air the chains were making <unk> and <unk> noises and my chair was turning wildly on its own axis says zwanzger
it was a long ride
and cold
it was new so maybe my fear was just psychological but i'd rather fly a plane from the one thousand nine hundred and seventy s than get back in that <unk> chairoplane
zwanzger's fear free alternative
any chairoplane in a european theme park with a budget of more than one hundred million euros
there is of course nothing remotely scary about a kid compatible classic that takes passengers on a mini tour of a world populated by friendly <unk> <unk>
and yet says zwanzger <unk> it's a small world ride as seen in its u.s. french japanese and hong kong parks has untapped potential as a psychological weapon
one ride is fun but try it about six or seven times and it becomes one of the scariest rides on earth
you ask yourself what if i was trapped here listening to that song and seeing these <unk> forever
if you were to chain someone in this ride and have them go around over and over i think it would actually break them
like many unnecessary things assembled in the one thousand nine hundred and eighty s among them the cadillac <unk> and mid career films of <unk> <unk> the <unk> loop <unk> seemed like a good idea at the time
looking back however it's hard not to view it as the work of an <unk> mind
it enjoyed a brief life in the summer of one thousand nine hundred and eighty five at the now defunct action park in <unk> new jersey before being shut down in one thousand nine hundred and ninety six reportedly after a series of accidents
i've been to almost three hundred theme and water parks now but this is by far the scariest thing i've ever seen says zwanzger
looking at it it's just so obvious that if you have one wrong move you're going to experience a lot of pain or get trapped inside
i can't believe this was actually built in the united states the country where you can be sued by anyone for just about anything
shortly after twelve ten a.m
et facebook and instagram went down leaving millions of users around the world briefly unable to post selfies or <unk>
visitors were greeted with a message that said sorry something went wrong
for others the page wouldn't load
the outage affected a large portion of the united states according to <unk> dot com
users across asia australia and new zealand also reported having trouble logging on
we're aware that many people are currently having trouble accessing facebook and instagram facebook spokeswoman <unk> <unk> told cnn
we're working to get things back to normal as quickly as possible
but an hour is an eternity
without facebook how are you supposed to know which friends are having birthdays
without instagram are you supposed to just describe your dinner
people quickly took to twitter
and the outage quickly spawned a hashtag <unk>
it ran the gamut of emotions
some were serious
some went old school
some made the most of it
some were ready for come what may
and some got really creative really fast
about fifty two minutes later both sites were up and running
facebook said the outage wasn't a third party attack but instead occurred after we introduced a change that affected our configuration systems
and all was right with the world
u.s. president barack obama became the first american chief guest at the parade
not only did he have to endure two hours of a cold delhi morning <unk> albeit in a glass box he also may have noticed how much of india's military hardware was of russian and not american vintage
but most indians will focus on the fact that obama is the first sitting american president to visit india twice
they will remember the many images of obama and prime minister narendra modi shaking hands and exchanging a warm embrace on the airport tarmac and at their first joint press conference in the world's glare
the indian media has dubbed it a bromance evidence of the chemistry that aides on both sides have been at pains to point out for months
it seems like an eternity since the former leader of the indian state of gujarat was persona non <unk> in the u.s
and so the biggest takeaway from obama's three days in india was the symbolism of the leaders of the world's two biggest democracies <unk> up
but others would have seen greater geopolitical implications
as obama watched the republic day parade beijing welcomed pakistan's army chief general raheel sharif for talks
unlike obama's previous india visit in two thousand and ten pakistan was not a focus at least in public statements
instead india seems to be positioning itself for a more global role playing a part in issues that go beyond its borders
there were some other tangible takeaways from the summit too though the exact details were a little fuzzy
modi announced progress had been made on negotiations over a civil nuclear deal a new ten year defense cooperation agreement between the two countries was announced which may have far reaching consequences for both sides on sharing intelligence and military education and there was much talk about boosting bilateral trade from its current level of around one hundred billion dollar a year to five hundred billion dollar by two thousand and twenty five
as with most <unk> between world leaders what goes on behind the scenes before and after is probably more important at least in terms of detail
but let's give symbolism its moment and its due
for millions of indians who watched the events of the last three days and given the intense media coverage in india it would have been impossible to miss they will now slowly <unk> their sense of india's place in the world
maybe that will help broaden india's historically <unk> foreign policy thinking
maybe it will make india a more prominent player in global issues over time
and maybe just maybe india and the u.s. may move a little closer to forming the defining partnership that obama first promised in two thousand and ten

the fourteen time grand slam winner rallied to beat <unk> qualifier tim smyczek in five sets in the second round but he couldn't come back against a better opponent tomas berdych in the quarterfinals tuesday
berdych crushed nadal six two six zero seven six thanks to a fine display of power tennis to end a seventeen match losing streak against the spaniard
one of those losses came in the two thousand and ten wimbledon final
earlier tuesday maria sharapova set up a semifinal <unk> with fellow russian <unk> makarova when she eased past <unk> bouchard six three six two and ten th seed makarova upset third seed <unk> halep six four six zero
while berdych barely missed on rod laver arena nadal called his own display very bad and said he helped berdych by lacking in his trademark intensity
the third was the right set the right game that i have to play nadal told reporters
but is obvious that before i didn't play with the right confidence with the right intensity losing court playing very short
i make him play very easy
so you can not expect to win matches in quarterfinals of a grand slam helping the opponent to play well
contributing to his fluctuating performances in melbourne were a lack of match practice added nadal
entering the australian open he'd only played eight tour level matches since the middle of july because of a wrist injury then <unk> in another long <unk>
besides <unk> against smyczek when nadal was ill the third seed struggled at times in the third round against <unk> <unk>
he turned it around against kevin anderson in the fourth round
when you are coming back from injuries you lose more easier the feeling than you do when you are on rhythm when you are with no injuries when you are confident in yourself that you played a lot of matches nadal said
and that's the thing that happened no
when i was playing well i played well
but at the same time against <unk> i played well two sets played bad the third
against anderson was probably the only match i played regular
played the right level during almost all the time
the rest of the matches have been lot of up and down
berdych however did what he had to hitting forty six winners and making only twenty one unforced errors
the tennis tour has seen a handful of retired grand slam winners return as coaches and berdych attempted to lure eight time grand slam champion ivan lendl murray's former coach last year
but lendl turned down the chance to work with his <unk> because he was according to berdych too busy
berdych instead opted for the twenty eight year old dani <unk> murray's former co coach
lendl and <unk> were by murray's side when he opened his grand slam account at the two thousand and twelve u.s. open before the scot became the first british man in almost eighty years to win wimbledon in two thousand and thirteen
berdych indeed admitted that <unk> helped him with his tactics against nadal and the effects were immediate
he changed a lot of things said berdych who next faces murray
he changed a lot of positive things
and the best is i'm really able to execute them really really quickly
that's how it should be
but
it's not only about sitting on the table and talking about the tactics it's also about you have to know what to do with that
if you have a plan it's a nice thing but if you never tried it before or never practiced before i mean that's useless
the twenty nine year old blasted past nadal in an hour in the first two sets
when nadal elevated his game in the third set berdych didn't <unk> even after he missed two match points on the nadal serve at six five
he stormed to a five one lead in the tiebreak a deficit that nadal wasn't able to overcome
berdych saved all four break points he faced and <unk> nadal's second serve winning seventy one percents of those points
today i have the only time i can to enjoy the victory said berdych
when i wake up tomorrow morning just all the focus goes for the next opponent and my next match
murray ended the run of nineteen year old <unk> nick kyrgios <unk> the spirits of most of those on rod laver arena who showed up for the night match
murray won six three seven six six three the turning point coming in the second set tiebreak
kyrgios the first teenager on the men's tour to make multiple grand slam quarterfinals since roger federer led four three with a mini break but paid the price for two short approach shots both punished by perfect murray <unk>
he was way too good for me kyrgios said
the other semifinal pairing will be determined wednesday
novak djokovic trying for a fifth australian open crown meets big serving canadian <unk> raonic and defending champion stan wawrinka <unk> u.s. open finalist kei nishikori
sharapova needed three sets to battle past bouchard at last year's french open but tuesday was easier for the five time grand slam winner
she was steady
bouchard meanwhile drowned in unforced errors making thirty and <unk> in only thirteen winners
if i don't have enough time i probably go for riskier shots and that's why i would miss a few more bouchard told reporters
that's why i think i made a few too many unforced errors
just feeling under pressure feeling i had to go for something
sharapova has turned around her tournament since saving two match points in the second round against qualifier alexandra panova
her dad <unk> who no longer travels with sharapova hasn't been shy to give her advice
when you're down and out like i was in the second match it's like i don't want to face that phone call with my father too many times during a tournament said sharapova who last won a major outside roland garros seven years ago
it's like i better get my stuff together
he told me that i was working much harder than i had to
if i was maybe a little bit smarter did a few things maybe a little bit differently maybe it could have been easier
makarova may not be a household name but the left <unk> has now reached consecutive grand slam semifinals
she handled the occasion better than halep who lost last year's french open final to sharapova in three dramatic sets
i practiced very well in the morning but maybe i was a little bit too stressed before i started the match halep told reporters
wasn't my good day
i had a bad day
in wednesday's two other quarterfinals top seed serena williams faces two thousand and fourteen finalist <unk> <unk> and venus williams battles madison keys in an all american contest
so as the storm hit she spent monday night at a friend's house
when she returned to her coastal home in <unk> massachusetts tuesday she discovered a devastating scene
rocks were everywhere she said
part of the roof collapsed the wall my door was missing she told cnn's ac three hundred and sixty
it was just destroyed
the massachusetts national guard sergeant and iraq war veteran cried when she caught the first glimpse of what happened
then she went back inside to get her uniforms a sword she got in iraq and a cross with <unk> on it that once hung on her wall
i've been through a lot and that was just more than i thought would have happened she said
just take it one day at a time
as crews started <unk> storm damage and clearing streets officials warned that the potential for record setting snowfall remains as stormy weather <unk> new england
but bruno and other residents of coastal areas faced another more <unk> threat
storm surge flooding
on massachusetts south shore the ocean roared <unk> to flood the <unk> rock <unk> lined with homes and businesses
<unk> police department posted a photo of what it called a major <unk> breach caused structural damage to an <unk> home
authorities in neighboring <unk> showed a deck blown yards away from a home
and not far away in <unk> <unk> ice seawater and debris clogged streets as waves came crashing toward shore
in boston where about two feet of snow had fallen the city's mayor said there was still work to be done
we're not out of this yet
we're trying to get ahead of it mayor marty walsh said
we just keep <unk>
the hardest hit area auburn <unk> got thirty two point five inches of snow
and it hasn't stopped yet
this is a very significant storm and in many parts of massachusetts i think you could call it in fact a historic event gov
charlie baker told reporters
massachusetts wasn't the only state getting hit hard tuesday
the national weather service also reported about twenty inches of snow in portland maine
thirty two inches in hudson new hampshire
and thirty inches in orient on new york's long island
on the northern edge of the storm in maine <unk> resident steve <unk> said at one p.m. that up to fifteen inches of snow was already on the ground and we're expected to get another ten inches
so what can you do in the meantime besides pray that the power stays on
it's just go out and clean up a little bit so you can said <unk> a cnn <unk>
then wait a few hours and do it again
the good news
most people seemed to have heeded the warnings about the storm which was forecast as crippling and potentially historic by <unk> up and staying off the roads
if you go through this every year after all there's a good chance you'll know the drill
during these storms everybody has to <unk> down and just be safe said bob connors from plum island on massachusetts north shore
we've become pretty <unk> at that
as the storm approached <unk> <unk> hoped for the best
it's not the first time she's <unk> for bad weather as the caretaker of a <unk> in <unk> new york
riding out superstorm sandy was terrifying she said
this storm which packed powerful winds also had it's scary moments she said
i was just praying i didn't get sick or the roof didn't blow off she said
what was i going to do
you know no one's coming to get you
but <unk> like many residents of new york and new jersey was breathing a sigh of relief on tuesday
a day earlier officials warned the storm could turn fifty eight million people's lives upside down
seven states from new jersey to new hampshire declared states of emergency
school was canceled
public transit shut down
businesses closed suggesting a far reaching economic impact in one of america's busiest commercial regions
but by <unk> snow wasn't even falling in new york city
by then travel bans in new jersey and new york even places like long island's <unk> which got more than twenty inches of snow had been lifted
new york city mayor bill de blasio called all the warning and preparations a better safe than sorry scenario
we've dodged the bullet he said
this is nothing like we feared it would be
but for some in the state the storm proved dangerous
a seventeen year old died after he hit something while snow <unk> monday night in huntington new york <unk> county's tim <unk> said
an eighty three year old man who suffered from dementia was found frozen to death in his backyard in the same long island county
the forecast even improved for boston
once expected to see up to thirty inches of snow logan international airport had received twenty four point four inches by midnight tuesday
still two feet of snow isn't anything to <unk> at
just ask all those who had their cars <unk> in their front doors blocked and their <unk> littered with branches tuesday
the worst part is the steady winds i think they were approaching fifty mph said nantucket police chief william <unk>
the entire island where fifteen thousand people live lost power during the storm
but that didn't stop the doctors and nurses at nantucket cottage hospital where <unk> keith moore was born at the height of the blizzard early tuesday
as she <unk> her newborn boy mom danielle smith said she was doing well thanks to the generator keeping the hospital warm
it's definitely better to be here than at home with no power she said
if you're trying to escape this wintry mess quickly don't count on it
traffic <unk> on everything from side roads to highways including the massachusetts <unk> which was closed to traffic as of early tuesday afternoon and many public transit systems shut down
more than four thousand seven hundred flights in and out of the united states had been canceled as of eight p.m. tuesday the flight tracking website flightaware dot com reported
that's on top of two thousand eight hundred scrubbed monday
hundreds more have already been called off for wednesday
amtrak was also affected suspending northeast regional and <unk> express services between new york and boston for tuesday because of the weather
what to know if you're traveling
the storm warnings seemed to impress even the most <unk> <unk> as groceries flew off store shelves from brooklyn to <unk>
still it's not like everyone was shaking in their snow boots
as steve <unk> a retired meteorologist who lives in <unk> massachusetts said we've done it before
in the coastal city of <unk> new hampshire hundreds accepted a facebook invitation to a community <unk> fight one that organizer <unk> murphy joked is in the proud tradition dating back to around one thousand six hundred and twenty four when the city was first settled
fresh off <unk> his driveway jim <unk> estimated about two feet of light <unk> snow had fallen outside his home in <unk> new hampshire
that's hardly a <unk> but it's also not surprising when you live in new england
sure that's a lot but i have tons of family in buffalo and they were dealing with six ten feet of at the start of the season <unk> said
we will weather this like the new <unk> we are
in a letter published on the website of the communist party newspaper <unk> castro said that although he didn't trust u.s. policies and have not exchanged a word with them this does not mean however that i would oppose a peaceful solution to conflicts or threats of war
last month cuba and the united states exchanged prisoners and agreed to discuss normalizing relations that had been trapped in over five decades of cold war animosity
while the u.s. economic trade embargo remains in place president barack obama announced he would lift some sanctions and ease travel restrictions for u.s. citizens wishing to visit the island
despite the major shift in policy for over a month castro made no public comment on the deal <unk> rumors that the eighty eight year old former cuban leader was in failing health
last week cuban and u.s. diplomats met to discuss re establishing embassies in washington and havana
while both sides hailed the first round of talks in havana as productive the negotiators sparred over issues like human rights and the discussions ended without signs of any breakthrough
talks are expected to resume in washington although no date has been set for the second round of discussions
the u.s. broke relations with cuba in one thousand nine hundred and sixty one amid fears that castro and his bearded revolutionaries <unk> communist sympathies
despite scores of cia assassination attempts against him and a failed u.s. backed invasion of cuba castro stayed in power until two thousand and six when a still undisclosed intestinal ailment forced him to step down
since then castro rarely appears in public instead <unk> on current events in occasional newspaper columns
raul castro replaced him as president and demonstrated a less confrontational style of leadership than his older brother who often led massive protests against u.s. policies
the younger castro has allowed more economic reforms to take place but resisted any challenges to the country's single party communist style of government
during the talks cuban officials said they hoped the united states and cuba could learn to <unk> despite the deep differences in the two countries political systems
we shall always defend the cooperation and friendship between all people among them our political adversaries fidel castro wrote in the message published monday
with this spirit i have fought castro concluded his letter and will continue fighting until my last breath
in recognition of our shared destiny the three countries should create a north american passport that would over time allow their citizens to travel work invest learn and innovate anywhere in north america
work tourist and student visas are necessities in the modern world to regulate the flow of people between sovereign states
in the north american context much like within the european union our economies and societies are far more integrated than our immigration system recognizes and a north american passport much like the eu passport would align our laws with reality
such a move would provide a dramatic break from washington's historical negligence of its near abroad which stems from a rare luxury
in contrast to other major continental powers through the centuries the united states has not had to worry much about its neighbors and devote the bulk of its military resources to protecting its borders
with no real threat next door the united states has felt free to roam elsewhere in the world as <unk> and secure as if we were an island nation
meanwhile our neighbors bolster our prosperity
mexico and canada are now the top two export markets for the united states and two of our top three trading partners overall
trade has exploded in the two decades since the passage of the north american free trade agreement or nafta which has created an integrated manufacturing platform and labor market
canada a stalwart ally that embodies the best of our shared democratic values has long been the no
one source of imported oil to the united states with mexico usually coming second or third
the north american region has become the fastest growing producer of oil and natural gas in the world and will surpass saudi arabia and opec within a decade or two as the global energy leader
this potential must be leveraged regionally with cross border infrastructure investments and environmental planning
even if washington still thinks in terms of <unk> lines separating nation states mineral resources are about as influenced by such lines on a map as the water <unk> down the colorado river
mexico an emerging powerhouse with more than one hundred million people is striving to consolidate its democratic gains and become a predominantly middle class society
the united states has a strong stake in this effort
mexico is the <unk> to our relations with the countries of central and south america
the economic prosperity education and security of mexico's people will help determine the overall competitiveness of north america on the global stage
moreover americans on this side of the rio grande must acknowledge the <unk> in the united states and treat mexicans living here with the dignity and respect they deserve
the inception of nafta marked an important step toward <unk> these geographic realities for a shared north american success
nafta has been a boon to our growth and competitiveness
integrated production platforms sometimes spanning all three countries have helped draw manufacturing back from competitors across the pacific
but the promise of nafta has fallen short in a critical respect
while trade and investment have grown the barriers to movement have remained too high for the people who help drive and stand to benefit from that growth
as evidenced by the recent political firestorm over president obama's executive move to allow more undocumented workers to avoid deportation it would take <unk> and courageous political leadership in all three countries to press for a north american passport
but the fact is that allowing north americans to move more effortlessly across the borders would help alleviate our contentious domestic immigration battles
we have more than ten million undocumented immigrants in this country because we didn't create a realistic legal avenue for the number of mexicans who would and should given our level of integration come to the united states over time
moreover by <unk> a wall along the border and making crossings so difficult costly and dangerous we have interrupted the old <unk> of <unk> flows trapping millions of workers on this side of the border
if we established a north american passport and adapted our legal framework to economic realities allowing people to move within our north american economy we wouldn't need to debate whether to offer more than ten million people u.s. citizenship
even a few years ago immigration was a far more polarizing issue in states like arizona
now the tide is slowly changing
more republicans are recognizing that their prior stance on immigration needs to change if they want to win over voters in the next presidential election
a north american passport would reflect the unique relationship and shared interests among our nations
in the face of growing competition from rising powers elsewhere in the world simply taking our geography for granted and focusing our attention elsewhere is no longer a viable option
attorneys for the estate said they are suing for damages and said the family wants to make certain that the many medical deficiencies that led to joan rivers death are never repeated by any outpatient surgery center
the lawsuit alleges that the doctors who performed the procedure at <unk> yorkville endoscopy clinic were reckless grossly negligent and <unk>
the lawsuit says they performed procedures to which rivers did not consent
it also alleges that one of the doctors did not have credentials or privileges to treat patients at the facility
clinic that did joan rivers procedure to be cut off medicare
the comedian went to the medical center for a procedure to evaluate her voice changes and to determine what was causing her stomach reflux according to the new york medical examiner
the lawsuit says rivers signed an authorization and gave her consent to let the doctors perform an upper endoscopy or egd with possible biopsy possible <unk> and possible <unk> of the esophagus
it was unclear if rivers had given verbal consent to any other procedure before being sedated
the lawsuit maintains she did not
during an upper endoscopy a camera is inserted to examine the upper part of the digestive system
a doctor controls the tiny camera on the end of a flexible tube
it is used to diagnose stomach esophagus and small intestine problems
a biopsy would be done if a doctor found an area that looked like there was some kind of cancer
voice changes can be a sign of throat cancer
a <unk> is done to remove nasal <unk> which are benign <unk> originating in the <unk> membrane that can block the nasal passages
during <unk> <unk> doctors <unk> or stretch the narrowed area of the esophagus which they may do as part of a sedated endoscopy procedure
it's most commonly done because the esophagus has narrowed from acid reflux
often patients with this problem have trouble swallowing and sometimes have pain
less commonly narrowing happens because of cancer of the esophagus
rivers first underwent a laryngoscopy
this is a procedure she did not consent to in writing
it is used by doctors to get a look at the vocal <unk> and <unk>
it was during this first procedure that her doctors had difficulty maintaining her oxygen saturation at an appropriate and safe level to ensure that her airway was not compromised the lawsuit says
then dr. lawrence cohen and dr. <unk> bankulla performed the upper endoscopy the procedure for which they did have written consent
when bankulla noticed the oxygen saturation level again dropped the lawsuit says she requested that the egd be stopped and the <unk> removed to increase rivers oxygen level
once her level was raised cohen <unk> the <unk> and continued the egd
the lawsuit argues that during this part of the procedure cohen and bankulla failed to ensure rivers airway was appropriately maintained and that they failed to properly observe and monitor joan rivers vital signs which were deteriorating and that her blood pressure dropped significantly as did her pulse and oxygen saturation level according to the lawsuit
after cohen completed the egd he took a <unk> with rivers while she was under <unk> during the procedure without her consent according to the lawsuit
when he took the photo the lawsuit says cohen announced that maybe rivers would like to see these in the recovery area
dr. gwen korovin then said she wanted to go down again and take another look doing another laryngoscopy the procedure for which the facility did not have written consent according to the lawsuit
korovin performed the laryngoscopy despite a concern voiced by bankulla that the procedure could compromise rivers airway the suit says adding that cohen told bankulla she was just being paranoid and the doctors proceeded with the second laryngoscopy
according to an october investigation by the medical examiner's office the cause of death was <unk> <unk> due to <unk> arrest a medical description of brain damage caused by lack of oxygen that happened during the laryngoscopy
rivers had a <unk> a <unk> of the vocal cords that makes it difficult to breathe according to the investigation
her body was unable to take in enough oxygen and eventually her heart stopped delivering fresh <unk> blood to her brain which shut down
when the doctors did notice that rivers vital signs had dropped as had her oxygen saturation level they tried to get her breathing better
when ten minutes of <unk> <unk> didn't work the lawsuit says bankulla asked another doctor to get the <unk> kit ready
in that case the lawsuit says the doctors should have performed an emergency <unk>
bankulla looked for korovin to perform a <unk> but the lawsuit says korovin had left the room
korovin is a well known doctor who has successfully treated an impressive list of celebrity clients who have come to her with voice trouble

korovin is a licensed medical doctor but she did not have privileges to perform surgical procedures at yorkville endoscopy nor was she <unk> to perform procedures at the facility according to the lawsuit
after rivers started to deteriorate further the lawsuit alleges that korovin left the room because she knew she was not permitted to perform medical services or procedures at that particular clinic and wanted to avoid getting caught
the lawsuit also says the doctors were <unk> trained to handle an emergency like the one they encountered
cnn left voice messages and emails for all the individuals and facilities named in the suit
so far none has responded to cnn's inquiries
in relation to this case in the past the yorkville endoscopy clinic has said our <unk> monitor the patient continuously utilizing state of the art monitoring equipment and remain at the bedside throughout the procedure and into recovery
it added that all its doctors are certified for advance cardiac life support
<unk> lawyer sent a statement in relation to past stories that said the doctor is respected and admired by her peers in the medical community and she is revered by her patients
as a matter of personal and professional policy dr. korovin does not publicly discuss her patients or their care and treatment
further dr. korovin is prohibited by state and federal confidentiality laws from discussing her care and treatment of any particular patient
for these reasons neither dr. korovin nor her attorneys will have any public comment on recent press reports regarding her practice
we ask that the press please respect dr. <unk> personal and professional policy of not discussing her patients as well as the privacy of her patients the statement said
in reaction to the lawsuit rivers daughter melissa rivers released a statement
filing this lawsuit was one of the most difficult decisions i've ever had to make said rivers
what ultimately guided me was my unwavering belief that no family should ever have to go through what my mother cooper and i have been through
the level of medical mismanagement <unk> disrespect and outrageous behavior is shocking and frankly almost incomprehensible rivers said
not only did my mother deserve better every patient deserves better
it is my goal to make sure that this kind of horrific medical treatment never happens to anyone again
fast forward three decades and san bao who has enjoyed a successful career writing pop songs and <unk> music production at the beijing olympics wants to make home grown musicals to rival some of andrew lloyd <unk> biggest hits
this is what i want a real musical with chinese characteristics he told cnn
san bao has made seven musicals since two thousand and five and his latest <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> currently on tour in china draws on a collection of <unk> tales written during the early qing dynasty
<unk> by government funding none of his musicals has yet made a profit let alone smashed box office records although a two thousand and five production called <unk> made it to south korean stages in a two thousand and eight tour
it takes time for people to appreciate this art form said san bao
ten years ago nobody in china would spend money buying a movie ticket but now
people don't talk about what movies they watched but about which ones they missed
some broadway shows have captivated chinese audiences
french revolution epic les <unk> was a hit when it debuted in shanghai in two thousand and two
more recently a chinese language version of <unk> mia
that <unk> in august two thousand and eleven <unk> twenty million yuan in less than a month and according to the china daily a two thousand and thirteen production of the phantom of the opera sold out five months before its premiere
read
six things you need to know the chinese <unk> mia
but high ticket prices mean these shows reach a limited audience and it's typically only the most accessible broadway hits that resonate with a chinese audience says zhou <unk> the head of the folk music and musical research center at <unk> university's academy of arts
<unk> mia
is entertaining that's why chinese accept it she says
of course there are other broadway musicals but it's only those with the highest entertainment value work in china she adds
nonetheless the rave reviews audiences have given to these shows make musical producers like san bao confident that combining broadway <unk> with chinese plot lines will one day result in a sure fire hit
as well as china's imperial past san bao has also made shows about a chinese cartoon character similar to <unk> and the chinese communist party's long march a six thousand mile journey that helped cement mao <unk> stature as a great leader
san bao says one of the biggest challenges he faces is the dearth of all round performers
few chinese actors and <unk> have equally strong singing and dancing skills that musical theater requires he said
and while china does offer some undergraduate courses in musical theater these departments are relatively new and the level of expertise is not deep
<unk> <unk> a classical music critic also says that musical productions often can't afford the high pay necessary to attract top talent
the musical industry is china is still <unk> he said
rather than continuing to rely on the government's <unk> san bao says he is looking for investors to fund his next project and hopes that will give him freer creative rein
the reason why i produce musicals and will keep doing it is because i like it very much
on monday blow wrote about another young black man's encounter with police his son who was allegedly held at <unk> on the yale university campus where he's a student
blow took to twitter on sunday writing that he was <unk> after his son called to tell him what happened saturday that he was walking out of the library when university police <unk> him and drew their weapons
blow tweeted that his son was detained because he fit the description of a suspect
blow's son was released and yale has said that the real suspect was found and arrested later
the <unk> son was shaken
on monday blow told cnn that his son is back in class and feeling better
he's a good kid and just wants to go to school
but one thing that he told me was really <unk> and worth sharing
he doesn't want this story to only be about him blow said
he realizes that there are other young people who have fewer privileges less access and endure even greater <unk> but whose stories go unreported until something truly tragic happens
he wants the focus to remain on them
i couldn't be <unk> of him for having the wisdom to recognize that
sunday night the columnist was incredibly angry after he says his son called him to explain what happened
i can't breathe and <unk> matter blow posted in a series of tweets
this is exactly why i have no patience for <unk> trying to convince me that the fear these young <unk> men feel isn't real <unk> the columnist wrote in tweets that were shared hundreds of thousands of times
yale released a statement monday that said blow's son was detained in the vicinity of a reported crime and that he closely matched the physical description of the suspect
let us be clear
we have great faith in the yale police department and admire the <unk> that its officers display on a daily basis to keep our campus safe
what happened
is not a replay of what happened in ferguson
staten island
cleveland
or so many other places in our time and over time in the united states
the officer who himself is african american was responding to a specific description relayed by individuals who had reported a crime in progress it read
the statement continued
even though the officer's decision to stop and detain the student may have been reasonable the fact that he drew his weapon during the stop requires a careful review
the school promised to share the results of that investigation with the broader community
on sunday yale spokeswoman karen <unk> wrote in email that yale police responded to an emergency call from <unk> in a residential community on campus saying that someone had entered their rooms under false <unk> pretending to be looking for someone
students in the same community had been <unk> that week <unk> explained and the police were looking for someone who was a tall african american college aged student wearing a black jacket and a red and white hat
the real suspect was later found on an adjacent residential community was arrested and is expected to face felony <unk> charges according to <unk>
blow declined sunday to talk to cnn about the incident but he gave a detailed account in his times column of what his son said happened
when his son was leaving the yale library around five forty five p.m. saturday he saw an officer jogging toward the entrance of another building across the grounds
blow's son recounted to his father that he started walking back to his dorm when he noticed a police officer following him and then speaking into his radio saying i got him
the officer shouted hey turn around
according to blow's <unk> of his son's story
the officer raised his gun and told the college student to get on the ground
blow's son the columnist writes dropped to his knees raised his hand and laid down on his stomach
he was then asked for his name and where he went to school
the student answered according to the columnist
then the officer told him to get up gave the student his name and told the student to call him the next day according to the <unk> <unk>
then blow's son said he got up and started to walk back to his dorm
according to blow his son told him
i was scared
my legs were shaking slightly
after a few more <unk> the officer hey my man
can you step off to the side
the student did as he was told
then one officer asked him to turn around to get a better view of the jacket the student was wearing
the officer asked for the <unk> name again and his id
blow's son <unk> according to the columnist
then the officer held him longer asking more questions blow writes
now don't get me wrong
if indeed my son matched the description of a suspect i would have had no problem with him being questioned appropriately blow wrote in the <unk> is his community his home away from home and he would have appreciated reasonable efforts to keep it safe
the stop is not the problem
the method of the stop is the problem
blow wrote that the dean of yale and the university police chief have apologized to him
but he wants answers
why was a gun drawn first
why was he not immediately told why he was being detained
why not ask for id first
what if my son had panicked under the stress having never had a gun pointed at him before and made what the officer considered a suspicious movement
had i come close to losing him
triggers can not be <unk>
bullets can not be called back blow wrote
this is the scenario i have always <unk>
my son at the wrong end of a gun barrel face down on the concrete he added
i had always <unk> the moment that we would share stories about encounters with the police in which our lives hung in the balance <unk> stories of joining the <unk> club
the thirty one year old lee happily shows off her winning display telling visitors how much fun she had making the bag with her partner a local design college student
the hardest part was <unk> the bottle cap on she said
i researched different types of bags
sometimes you need a bigger bag if you want to put more things inside
walk around the room and the exhibition is full of discarded items wine boxes cd covers and <unk> now reborn as pen holders <unk> and lamps
in a sense lee and the fifteen or so people involved with the project have been neglected in one way or another by hong kong society all of these people have struggled to get by because they all have intellectual disabilities
despite the pride she has for her daughter <unk> mother worries about her
her character is too simple and warm
i'm worried she will get hurt and sometimes she has to be careful about what she says
people living with down syndrome are often stuck with <unk> jobs
but this exhibition run by the local salvation army gave lee and others the chance to learn a new skill partner with a local student to reinvent trash into treasure all in an effort to raise disability awareness
in chinese <unk> people with disabilities have been associated with bad luck that the disability was a punishment for the <unk> of an <unk>
many lived in hiding encountering discrimination and <unk> advocates say
but increasingly people are finding ways to counter misconceptions and bring people with disabilities into the mainstream
it's an experience that heidi hui a social work professor at the university of hong kong and mother of a daughter with down syndrome knows well
hui explains that traditionally disabled people are seen as an <unk> something that is no good
there is a chinese saying that it must be the family who is doing something wrong
in the older days they were saying that it's a kind of punishment
hui recalled that when she and other parents of children opened their first center for the down syndrome association more than twenty years ago the windows were broken and they couldn't use the elevator because neighbors didn't want them there
the group responded by holding workshops with residents to explain and dispel myths about down syndrome
a few years later the group was finally allowed to use the elevator and the workshops no longer became necessary
although information about disability is now widely available some of that stigma exists today
catrin anderson is a fifteen year old with cerebral <unk> who requires round the clock care
she can't move but she can see and hear
she often has to deal with strangers talking about her in front of her
her mother kim anderson originally from britain said
the difficult thing with catrin is that if she is in company and people are talking about her she's understanding everything they're saying
to combat this problem she made a sign in english and chinese telling people she can see and hear
for anderson the key to change in attitudes is integration
that's maybe what we're still not doing enough of in hong kong maybe in schools and getting people like catrin
out and about in society because until they're in society society is not going to fully understand or appreciate them
the census department estimates that about ten percents of the city's population has physical or intellectual disabilities based on on figures from two thousand and fourteen
at another photo exhibition featuring people with disabilities <unk> lee a nineteen year old with down syndrome strikes a <unk> pose in his green belt
his father peter lee said he believes attitudes are changing
more and more people with disabled child or children the parents will take them outside to encounter the whole world let them learn let them go to school and not just hide the disabled child or children in hong kong
nowadays more and more parents love or like to do that
frank freeman photographed lee and other young people with down syndrome as models for his exhibition entitled the <unk> people
he photographed young people showing off their hobbies such as acting dancing and swimming
there have been efforts around the globe to be more inclusive of people with down syndrome including target ads in the united states featuring child models and a tv ad by british department store marks and spencer's
two years ago freeman started volunteering with the down syndrome association and realized part of the problem was that people didn't know how to talk to those with the condition and that they were often treated as patients instead of people
he said that the aim of the exhibition was to show a more playful side of people with down syndrome
they just want to love and be involved in making people happy he said
hill has an iq of approximately seventy and the emotional capacity of a young boy said his attorney brian kammer
federal law stemming from a two thousand and two virginia case that went to the u.s. supreme court says executing intellectually disabled individuals violates the eighth <unk> ban on cruel and unusual punishment
but the case also allows states to define intellectual disability
in georgia that means attorneys for death row inmates have to prove mental impairment beyond a reasonable doubt
this is the <unk> standard in any jurisdiction in the nation kammer said
hill's execution would come two weeks after the state executed andrew <unk> a vietnam war veteran suffering from post traumatic stress disorder who killed <unk> county deputy kyle <unk> in one thousand nine hundred and ninety eight
kammer also was <unk> counsel
kammer who has represented hill for twenty years said in any other state hill would be serving a life sentence
hill was sentenced to death in one thousand nine hundred and ninety for killing fellow prison inmate joseph <unk> beating him to death with a nail <unk> board
at the time hill had been serving a life sentence for the one thousand nine hundred and eighty five shooting death of his girlfriend <unk> wright
we acknowledge that mr. hill should be held accountable for his actions and behavior <unk> <unk> president of the arc of georgia said in a letter written on hill's behalf
however it is our contention that mr. hill who has an intellectual disability should not be subject to capital punishment
the arc is a nonprofit organization that advocates for and serves people with intellectual and developmental disabilities
hill also has the support of the american association on intellectual and developmental disabilities the georgia naacp and former president jimmy carter and his wife <unk> carter
the victim's family and former jurors have also expressed support for mercy in hill's case saying they weren't given the option of life without parole when sentencing him to death
kammer said seven doctors agree that his client is intellectually disabled including three doctors for the state who initially evaluated hill and said he didn't meet georgia's standard
kammer said those doctors have since signed an affidavit admitting they felt rushed during hill's examination and now believe he does meet the standard for intellectually disabled
in previous clemency hearings attorneys for the state have argued that hill served in the navy held a job and managed his money before killing his girlfriend signs that he didn't necessarily meet the legal standard for intellectually disabled even though he has a low iq
but kammer said examples of hill achieving self <unk> don't make a strong case for his execution
several of the letters supporting hill's clemency cite last year's supreme court decision that struck down a florida law that used <unk> standards for determining intellectual disability for death row inmates
attorneys tried to use the hall v. florida decision as grounds to spare the life of georgia inmate robert wayne <unk> who was sentenced to death for the murder of a local sheriff's deputy
<unk> who also had an iq of seventy was executed in december
hill's case was presented monday before the georgia state board of <unk> and <unk>
a statement from the board said it will make a decision prior to the scheduled execution which is set for seven p.m. tuesday
a frigid new england looks to recover after a massive winter storm
the word on the street or on the internet at least is that plans are <unk> to develop an erotic entertainment attraction on the island's southwest coast national scenic area
after interest was aroused by details posted on the region's official website however the page was quickly taken down
the park's administration director cheng <unk> <unk> confirmed with cnn that the proposal is real but he insists it's just a concept at this point
the ideal plan is to realize the proposal within this year if we can gain support from the local government said cheng
details of the plan circulated by a user on taiwan's popular <unk> online bulletin board outlined a taiwan romantic boulevard <unk> route with four zones stretching across three counties
each stage has a different theme
dating paradise scenic spot for wedding gowns silk road of love and a proposed ten thousand meter square sex theme park
the sex theme park or garden of <unk> as it's called in the proposal will be modeled after other erotic parks around the world including <unk> <unk> in south korea and <unk> park in oslo norway
claiming to be educational the park will serve as the final stop of the four stage journey of love
it'll be divided into different sections covering topics including sex positions unusual sex lives and sex toys
the dating paradise is perfect for those who are more than friends but aren't officially a couple yet the proposal said
cheng said that the proposal shouldn't have been made public before being finalized but insisted if realized that it will help <unk> a neglected area
the southwestern coast of taiwan has been an important salt farm since the qing dynasty he says
it has a unique background culture and ecological value
yet a decade after it was declared a national scenic area it still hasn't received much attention from tourists
so we thought to ourselves is it time to try a new mode of thinking
the white <unk> salt hill and salt farm have always emitted a romantic feeling for visitors coming to the area said cheng
that's why we came up with the idea to be the first dating wedding themed park in taiwan
this is the first time i find a government proposal interesting said one online critic according to taiwan's now news
another said
we surpass japan
the pride of taiwan
this is too out of line posted another
and soon the government will start promoting sex tourism
chang huang chen the deputy commissioner for <unk> county the sex park's proposed home told the taipei times that the idea may not be suitable for traditional minded locals
cheng said he'd received mostly supportive comments but he welcomed different opinions
sex has always been a taboo in chinese society he added
but it's a part of our lives and a very natural thing why can't we discuss it openly and generously
aside from the sex park the rest of the proposal makes use of existing attractions
we're planning to add around one hundred landmarks and installations to each of stage to enrich the experience said cheng
the proposed route starts at the scenic six story high salt hill in <unk> county
it then leads to <unk> a place famous for its vibrant pre wedding photo shooting industry where churches and dozens of other romantic landmarks are built for that purpose
the third destination <unk> is a fishing town in <unk>
the proposal calls it the right place to take your oath before heading to the sex theme park
the white house incident occurred the same day a cia drone strike was launched in yemen the first such strike in almost two months following the yemeni government being forced out of office last week
this indicates that the cia drone program is still moving forward despite the instability in yemen
not so long ago launching a u.s. strike on the other side of the world with an armed drone would have been something from science fiction
before nine eleven the united states had only a handful of experimental drones that had never been used to kill anyone
today there are at least seven thousand drones in <unk>
arsenal more than two hundred of which are armed drones that have killed thousands of people
this large american fleet <unk> a harbinger of an important trend
armed drones will likely prove as important to the future of warfare as tanks were during world war ii
we can of course expect to see them used not only by the united states but also by other countries such as china and russia that are jumping into the production of armed drones
but we will also see them being used by terrorist groups
a harbinger of this <unk> the militant shiite group based in lebanon that in september reportedly used <unk> bomb a building in neighboring syria used by the al qaeda affiliated al nusra front
the drone attack killed a number of militants
iran is the key sponsor for hezbollah and <unk> <unk> the past several years to have manufactured armed drones
hezbollah's use of drones marked a milestone for terrorist groups worldwide
it would be the first time a terrorist group used armed drones successfully to carry out an attack
that said it will likely be many years before other countries or terrorist groups are able to build up the capacity that the united states has to carry out lethal drone strikes
after all the united states has had drone bases in countries such as afghanistan <unk> and saudi arabia
and it isn't as easy as some might think to arm a drone
such weapons systems require specific electrical engineering
the wings must be reinforced for the aircraft to sustain the force of launching a missile
the drone must be equipped with fire control systems and built in mounting <unk> are needed to attach <unk> to the vehicle
still even with these inherent limitations the drone industry thrives and more companies and nations continue to jump on board the drone <unk>
according to a count by new america some eighty countries have some kind of drone capability but few of them have succeeded in arming their drones
the united states aggressive and secretive drone campaign against al qaeda and its affiliates in countries such as yemen appears to be setting a powerful international precedent about the use of armed drones
despite this fact there has been virtually no substantive public discussion about what an international legal framework governing such drone attacks should be among policymakers at the international level
it's long past due for that conversation to happen
perhaps a drone landing inside the white house perimeter will help <unk> a wider discussion about how we might prevent a future drone flying into the white house grounds one that might actually be armed
jeffrey sterling was convicted on nine felony counts of unauthorized disclosure of national defense information according to the washington post after allegedly leaking classified information about a top secret cia operation to undermine iran's nuclear program to new york times reporter james risen
this is a just and appropriate outcome u.s. attorney general eric holder said in a statement
the <unk> unauthorized disclosures of classified information compromised operations undertaken in defense of america's national security
the disclosures placed lives at risk
fbi director james <unk> said sterling violated his sworn duty to protect our nation's secrets and he <unk> our country
the fbi will continue to pursue these cases vigorously he said in a statement
the case surged to the spotlight in light of the obama administration's aggressive track record of prosecuting <unk> and after federal prosecutors served risen with a subpoena a controversial tactic that raises questions about press rights
risen refused to disclose the names of any of his anonymous sources
prosecutors claimed that sterling disclosed the classified information in an attempt to get back at the cia after he was fired from the agency
despite lacking any record of phone calls or emails between sterling and risen the prosecution was able to secure a guilty verdict after it argued that sterling was the only person with knowledge of the covert program described in <unk> book to know risen and with a motive to disclose the classified information
prosecutors argued that <unk> disclosure damaged american efforts to halt iran's nuclear weapons program and put lives at risk
the new york times famously decided not to publish <unk> story on the covert program at the urging of top officials in president george w. bush's administration who claimed the story would damage u.s. national security
risen ultimately published the account in his two thousand and six book state of war
sterling will be sentenced on april twenty four
in a tense finale to group b all four teams still had the chance to qualify for the last eight until the final whistle went in a <unk> draw between cape verde and zambia in <unk> conditions
it sparked contrasting celebrations the coaches and players in <unk> celebrating in unison while there were tears in <unk> as two thousand and twelve champions zambia bowed out in the group stages for a second successive tournament
tunisia coach georges <unk> had called on his side the two thousand and four <unk> champions to go all out for the win despite only needing to draw the match to qualify

for a time dr congo tournament winners in one thousand nine hundred and sixty eight and one thousand nine hundred and seventy four looked devoid of a response until drawing level against the run of play in the sixty five th minute through substitute jeremy <unk>
it was <unk> two goals that had helped seal his <unk> route to the tournament against ivory coast and just five minutes after coming on he once again provided a telling difference
a long ball was headed into the box by <unk> <unk> <unk> controlled it with <unk> and guided the ball into the net with his left foot
it was all the more <unk> as moments earlier <unk> <unk> should have already put the game out of dr <unk> reach
but dr congo held firm for a record sixth straight draw in the tournament the game ending slightly <unk> in the final minute with neither side really playing as news of the result from <unk> came in
that match was never going to be a classic the two teams having scored just three times in forty combined attempts in this tournament and it was a cause not helped by a <unk> that threatened to see the game abandoned altogether
if zambia had hoped the players would be inspired to shine in the wake of a pre match call from president edgar <unk> who won the election at the weekend then they were to be <unk> disappointed
<unk> evans <unk> had the chance to grab the win his side needed to qualify late on but made a hash of his effort while cape verde level on three points with dr congo only missed out on the quarter finals by virtue of goal difference

and then we give to the fishermen we give refrigerators to the fishermen
and we give working capital to small in the villages
so from the consumption to the production
from the <unk> activities to the productive activities
two months after taking office airasia flight qz eight thousand five hundred and one crashed in indonesian waters with one hundred and sixty two people on board
i don't know why the plane went down the president told amanpour
it can be because of the weather it can be because of other reasons
we are not sure about that now
but the most important thing is that the operation was conducted quickly and we are continuing the removal of bodies from the ocean floor
a preliminary report is due out this week
last week the country's transportation minister said the plane had climbed rapidly and stalled before it crashed into the sea
airasia is a malaysian carrier but indonesia has long had a troubled airline industry and regulatory system
so dangerous is the country's industry that only five indonesia airlines are permitted to fly within the european union more than sixty others are banned as of november
what we want to fix is the system
we are going to fix this he says
but the of system administration is not related to the airline accidents
airasia flight qz eight thousand five hundred and one was not licensed to fly its route from surabaya indonesia to singapore on the day it took off
there is no relation he insisted between the regulatory system and the crash
as the world's largest muslim majority nation and democracy indonesia is often held up as a beacon of moderation
since the killings of seventeen people in france this month the world has turned its focus to radical islam in a greater way perhaps than any time since nine eleven
the world in some way is looking to this country among others to hold the line
most of the world's muslims are not arab and indonesia is a case in point
there is no compromise for violence
no compromise
and we really condemn that
but we also need to respect each other respect other religions among people between individuals we have to respect each other widodo says
differences can be a beauty
it's not going to be something that's scary
the country has had its <unk> with violent <unk> a two thousand and two al qaeda affiliated attack in bali that left two hundred and two dead and a long running but now diminished islamic separatist movement in <unk>
between two hundred and fifty and three hundred <unk> have gone to fight with isis and other extremist groups in syria widodo says
the number is really small he points out for a population with a quarter billion people
we have a good experience in handling radicalism and extremism through not only security approach but also cultural and religious approach
in indonesia we have big moderate islamic organizations widodo says
those organizations are the ones who teach moderate islam islam that has got good tolerance toward any other religions
and thanks be to god that in indonesia at present this process going well
the security approach doesn't solve the problem will not solve the problem
but religious approach cultural approach going to lessen a lot
some analysts worry that radical islamist organizations in indonesia may <unk> the training ground syria has provided
there are some people who went using fake or forged passports but they arrested in our airports widodo says
we want indonesia to be an example of moderate islam islam that has tolerance good islam
and i am sure that we are able to do so
in indonesia islam and democracy can go together
indonesia can be a land of ruthless politics
three months into his term widodo was facing his first big administrative crisis
his choice for police chief <unk> <unk> was a favorite of the head of his political party and <unk> former president <unk> <unk>
days after widodo announced the nomination <unk> was indicted by the country's anti corruption commission
in apparent retaliation police arrested the deputy chief of the country's anti corruption body
these events have rocked and gripped the country the subject of protests and daily page one newspaper stories
our commitment still is to eradicate corruption widodo tells amanpour through an interpreter
and we have to also use the presumption of innocence principle
because of the corruption investigation he says <unk> inauguration as chief despite overwhelming approval of parliament has been delayed
everybody has to be mature in looking at it as a legal process and the president is not allowed to intervene
this is a legal process
the rise of a <unk> politician may have given hope to those who wanted a <unk> president but <unk> approach to drug smugglers on death row has been cold comfort
in december he announced that he would reject clemency requests for sixty four inmates sentenced to die
six prisoners were killed by firing squad this month including five foreigners
brazil and the netherlands withdrew their ambassadors in protest
two australians are due to face the firing squad
widodo rejected their requests for clemency as well over appeals from the australian prime minister
imagine every day we have fifty people die because of narcotics of drugs
in one year it's eighteen thousand people who die because of narcotics
we are not going to compromise for drug dealers
no compromise
no compromise he says
the decision of death penalty is on the court
but they can ask for amnesty to the president
but i tell you there will be no amnesty for drug dealers
so no relief amanpour asked for the australians due to die
no the president shook his head
eighteen thousand people die every year
i ask you is it not more dangerous
that's the big question on the mind of indonesia's transportation minister as investigators finish preparing the initial report into the crash last month of the airbus a three hundred and twenty two hundred with one hundred and sixty two passengers on board
the question is why this plane suddenly climbed from thirty two thousand feet to almost thirty eight thousand feet without any information and any warning ignasius jonan told cnn in an interview monday
jonan said none of the other planes in the area experienced the turbulent weather patterns that led the pilot of qz eight thousand five hundred and one to request a change of course and an increase in altitude shortly before it disappeared off radar
data provided by the indonesian transportation ministry shows that less than three minutes after making that request flight qz eight thousand five hundred and one began climbing sharply rising nearly six thousand feet in less than a minute
the plane then fell rapidly and disappeared off radar in the middle of the java sea
that sequence of events is based on radar and <unk> information not on the contents of the plane's flight data recorder
the analysis of the information from the data recorder and the other so called black box the cockpit voice recorder is expected to be part of the preliminary report that indonesia is due to submit to international air safety regulators by january twenty eight
the transportation minister told cnn that he wants to ensure the victims families and the public are kept informed and that there's nothing hidden from them
but when asked if that meant he would release the preliminary report to the public he said no
jonan said he will urge investigators to release the final report as soon as possible
it won't be a year that's my promise he said
jonan oversaw an investigation into why flight qz eight thousand five hundred and one was able to take off on a sunday even though airasia lacked permission to fly from surabaya to singapore on that day of the week
his inquiry discovered sixty other flights had been running without proper approvals
those flights have been banned he says and ministry officials are now regularly checking the schedules
while he calls the issue of flights operating without permission a big worry he says he believes it was unrelated to the crash of flight qz eight thousand five hundred and one
he also says he thinks that this crash should not be seen as a permanent black mark against indonesia's safety record
we run around one thousand flights a day and seven thousand flights a week jonan said
and that's a lot of flights in the air of indonesia
so one crashed unfortunately
so i would suggest it's not a big issue that can make everybody not fly in the air of indonesia

the sixty six year old has been at the helm of the royal netherlands football association since august two thousand and eight and has openly called for the current incumbent sepp blatter to step down
he announced his decision to stand on the body's official website and raised concerns about fifa's current leadership in the process
i am very worried about the deteriorating situation at fifa the public opinion the <unk> is very bad and with me a lot of people in the world believe so he said
i was hoping that a credible fresh face would stand up to do it but unfortunately that is not the case
so that's why i decided to take my own responsibility especially after what i said in sao paulo and therefore i go for it
fifa has to be normalized and fifa has to be <unk>
in my business life and also in <unk> and also in my association i went through this exercise many many times so i have a lot of experience in that respect
so i believe i'm the right person to do it
van <unk> announcement comes just a day after blatter said in an interview with cnn that uefa lacked the courage to come in and stand against him in the presidential elections
van praag is one of a number of candidates hoping to topple the leader of football's world governing body who has been in the job for seventeen years
after being re elected <unk> in two thousand and eleven blatter could now face van praag former <unk> and tottenham footballer david ginola as well as independent candidate jerome champagne in <unk> ballot
van praag was president of the netherlands most successful club <unk> between one thousand nine hundred and eighty nine and two thousand and three following in the footsteps of his father <unk>
during his reign <unk> added six dutch league titles to its roll call of honors the current total now standing at thirty three
van praag has also been a member of <unk> executive committee since two thousand and nine
blatter announced his intention to step down at the end of his fourth term but backtracked at fifa's congress in brazil last year claiming his mission was not yet finished
that decision drew criticism from a number of fifa member countries given the allegations of corruption relating to the bidding process for the two thousand and eighteen world cup awarded to russia and the two thousand and twenty two <unk> given to qatar
van praag was one of those to suggest blatter should step down telling him at a meeting of european officials
few people still take fifa seriously and however you look at it blatter is mainly responsible
you are not making things easy for yourself and i do not think you are the man for the job any longer
fifa's image has deteriorated because of everything that's happened in recent years
people link fifa to corruption and bribery and all kinds of old boy's networks
blatter enjoys firm support from the majority of fifa's two hundred and nine member associations and many see <unk> elections as a <unk> conclusion despite the last few being <unk> by scandal and difficulty
the swiss enlisted u.s. lawyer michael garcia to probe claims that <unk> former <unk> member mohamed bin hammam used a multi million dollar <unk> fund to buy support for the bid charges that qatar bid have strenuously denied
garcia quit his role as chairman of the investigatory chamber of the fifa ethics committee after <unk> to the way his report into the bidding process had been <unk> by german judge hans <unk> eckert the organization's independent ethics <unk>
bin hammam was the only challenger to the president four years ago but withdrew from the race after he was suspended on bribery charges leaving blatter to run <unk> amid <unk> scenes at the congress in zurich
the head of european soccer's governing body michel platini has called on blatter to stand down but announced he would not personally be running for president
it remains to be seen whether ginola or any of his fellow candidates can make a significant dent in the support blatter holds among fifa's members and make the may elections anything more than another <unk> conclusion
the announcement comes a day after an iraqi official declared that iraq's diyala province had been liberated from isis
idriss nassan <unk> deputy foreign minister told cnn he expects an official announcement tuesday if things continue this way
ypg is in control nassan said using the acronym for the people's protection units
they are making sure to clear the streets and the places from isis to declare it a free city
ypg spokesman <unk> can confirmed the news in a tweet
congratulations for liberation of kobani to all of humanity kurdistan and people of kobani
nassan called for the quick implementation of a humanitarian corridor to help the myriad refugees in the city whom he said need everything
a kobani official who did not want to be named because it would interfere with tuesday's official announcement said the kurds were going house to house in the newly liberated area to check for booby traps
once the traps are removed or <unk> the fighters will invite residents to return to their homes the official said
according to london based opposition group the syrian observatory for human rights which also confirmed kobani was liberated since october six when isis first raised its banner on the city's outskirts the fighting among isis ypg and the rebel <unk> backing ypg has killed nine hundred and seventy nine isis combatants three hundred and twenty four ypg fighters and twelve rebels
thirty eight more isis militants died in attacks using booby trapped vehicles or explosive belts and the isis shelling of kobani killed twelve civilians sohr said
on the other hand hundreds of militants died during u.s. and arab allies airstrikes on the city and its countryside
meanwhile large parts of the city have become uninhabitable due to u.s. and arab allies air raids detonation of booby trapped vehicles and mutual shelling the group said
kobani apparently declared itself autonomous exactly one year before monday's victory sohr said

gen. <unk> <unk> al <unk> also announced that diyala is now under full control of iraqi security forces
isis has been fighting for kobani for months hoping to add it to the territory it already controls in syria and iraq as part of what it calls its independent islamic nation
syria has been embroiled in a more than three year civil war with government troops battling isis and other rebels elsewhere leaving <unk> ethnic kurds to defend the city
kobani aka ayn al arab is strategically important because of its location on the border with turkey
airstrikes by the united states and its allies part of a larger u.s. led coalition effort against isis in the region intermittently take out isis targets in the area
the coalition started operations in september

we'll analyze the vehicle the bodies and hopefully we can come to some conclusion as to how they met their fate
earlier monday the suspect sought in the case who had posted a craigslist ad turned himself in the telfair county sheriff's office said on its facebook page

no one has heard from them since
he was excited about the car
he had one when he got back from vietnam daughter stephanie bishop told cnn affiliate <unk> tv in atlanta
asked whether towns owned a <unk> like the one the <unk> were looking for steverson replied he does not
we feel that the entire communication he had with mr. runion was deceptive

after we interviewed him our efforts to contact him were unsuccessful
today we've contacted his family and they've been helpful in locating him
for days authorities searched for the couple using helicopters and <unk> steverson said

the drone strike the latest in a long string of them by the obama administration is the first since last week's dramatic events in the capital sanaa
three u.s. officials tell cnn the cia conducted a drone strike in marib which is east of sanaa
it is not thought that any major leaders of al qaeda in the arabian peninsula were targeted in the latest u.s. strike
the cia itself did not comment
the u.s. state department meanwhile announced what was happening with the embassy
due to the recent resignation of the yemeni president prime minister and cabinet and the ongoing security concerns the u.s. embassy in sanaa is unable to provide routine consular services and will have very limited ability to assist with emergency cases involving u.s. citizens the department said in a statement monday
the u.s. embassy will be closed to the public until further notice out of an abundance of caution and care for our employees and others who may be visiting the embassy
we are continuously analyzing the security conditions and will resume consular operations as soon as our analysis indicates we are able to do so safely
there has been a surge in fighting between ukraine government forces and pro russian separatists in recent days
on saturday at least thirty civilians were killed in shelling in the southeastern city of mariupol while eight people died when a transit stop in the city of donetsk was <unk> thursday
both sides blamed the other for the deaths
speaking after a meeting with the european commissioner for humanitarian aid and crisis management poroshenko said the actions of russian backed terrorists and regular russian troops had caused <unk> to suffer
we are going to file a suit to the <unk> tribunal which must investigate into these crimes against humanity poroshenko said
it is a test for humanity and moral dignity
because turning a blind eye to such horrible and shameful crimes means <unk> terrorists and <unk> and violating high european values for which <unk> are suffering and dying
on sunday ukraine's national security and defense council authorized the government to initiate the <unk> action it said in a statement
it said it would ask for the donetsk people's republic and luhansk people's republic to be designated terrorist organizations
the international criminal court at the <unk> is a permanent body established by one hundred and twenty nations to investigate the most serious crimes of concern to the international community
earlier monday moscow stepped up its war of words over ukraine warning western countries not to give kiev the impression it had their automatic support regardless of its actions
at a press conference in moscow russian foreign minister sergey lavrov blamed kiev for the renewed fighting and civilian deaths and questioned the west's lack of condemnation
lavrov said moscow which accuses ukrainian forces of responsibility had not heard a single statement from the west criticizing kiev
we hope our western partners won't stay away and european countries primarily france and germany who are taking part in so called normandy format and mainly the u.s. won't do anything to create an illusion for kiev's government that its actions lead to automatic support in the west
lavrov said there was no other path to resolve ukraine than direct dialogue between ukraine's conflicting sides
fighting between ukraine government forces and pro russian separatists broke out last spring slowing for a short lived ceasefire agreed to in minsk belarus in september
ukraine and the west accuse russia of sending troops and equipment over the border to help the separatists allegations that russia denies
the united states and european union have imposed financial sanctions against russian interests
the u.s. state department on sunday said secretary of state john kerry and lavrov had spoken by phone about the shelling of civilians
the secretary reiterated our condemnation of the separatists grad missile attack on civilians in mariupol yesterday twenty five kilometers beyond the minsk line and other separatist attacks in blatant violation of the agreement
the secretary reiterated the need for an immediate <unk> of the ceasefire a withdrawal of heavy weapons and closing the border
he also underscored u.s. readiness to participate in serious settlement efforts making clear that de escalation is in everyone's interests that russia will be judged by its actions and that the costs to russia will only increase if attacks continue a representative said
the white house says vice president biden also spoke with ukrainian president poroshenko on saturday
they expressed grave concern over russia's blatant disregard for its commitments under the september minsk agreement and unilateral escalation of the conflict the white house said
the two leaders vowed to ensure that the costs continue to rise on russia for its aggressive actions against ukraine
those who give such criminal orders bear responsibility for this
people doing that should know that there is no other way of resolving such conflicts than peace negotiations and political measures he said
on monday the state run <unk> tass news agency reported russian president vladimir putin as saying a nato legion was working in ukraine with the aim of containing russia
in essence this is already not an army but a foreign legion in this case nato's foreign legion that certainly does not pursue the goal of defending ukraine's national interests <unk> tass quoted putin as saying
but following a special session of nato's ukraine commission in brussels belgium secretary general jens stoltenberg told journalists that putin's allegations were nonsense
stoltenberg said there was no nato legion and the only foreign forces in ukraine are russian
the conflict in eastern ukraine broke out last spring after russia annexed ukraine's southeastern crimea region and as pro russia separatists claimed control of the luhansk and donetsk regions
the ceasefire from minsk crumbled long ago
from mid april to january twenty one the conflict killed at least five thousand and eighty six people and injured at least ten thousand nine hundred and forty eight others according to the united nations
no truce with ukraine rebel leader says
we fear that the real figure may be considerably higher the office of the u.n. high commissioner for human rights said about the death toll in a report released friday

nasa images released monday reveal the asteroid officially known as two thousand and four bl eighty six has its own small moon
the grainy black and white photos show the asteroid about a third of a mile in size spinning through space with its two hundred and thirty foot wide moon trailing behind
asteroid two thousand and four bl eighty six came about seven hundred and forty five thousand miles from earth or about three times as far away as the moon just after eleven a.m
et monday according to nasa
it was far enough that it didn't pose a threat to earth but close enough to give scientists and amateurs a chance to observe a large asteroid up close
it was the closest known asteroid this large to pass near earth until two thousand and twenty seven when an asteroid called one thousand nine hundred and ninety nine an ten flies by
observers on the ground didn't see much when the asteroid was closest to earth monday morning because it wasn't at its brightest
only a portion of its illuminated side was visible according to sky and telescope magazine
the asteroid <unk> as it got farther from the earth because its face became more fully illuminated the magazine said
the best chance for viewing was from eight p.m
et monday to one a.m
et tuesday
nasa scientists snapped radar generated images of the asteroid using the deep space network antenna at <unk> california and the <unk> observatory in puerto rico
while it poses no threat to earth for the foreseeable future it's a relatively close approach by a relatively large asteroid so it provides us a unique opportunity to observe and learn more don yeomans the recently retired manager of nasa's near earth object program office at the jet propulsion laboratory in pasadena california said in a nasa news release
yeomans retired on january nine after sixteen years of tracking asteroids
paul chodas has been designated as the new manager
we should be getting some great radar images of this asteroid chodas told cnn before the asteroid passed
radar would be the key to study the asteroid's surface give an idea of its shape whether it has rocks and that kind of stuff on it
it'll be really exciting
observers without binoculars or a scope watched from their computers on the virtual telescope project two point zero
the asteroid was discovered on january thirty two thousand and four by a telescope of the lincoln near earth asteroid research survey in white sands new mexico

the militants appear to have killed one of the two japanese hostages they have been holding
and they're apparently demanding the release of a convicted terrorist in jordan to spare the life of the other
here's where things stand at the moment
a video file posted online saturday by a known isis supporter shows an image of one hostage kenji goto holding a photo of what appears to be the corpse of his fellow captive haruna yukawa
the voice of a person claiming to be goto speaks over the image saying in english that japanese prime minister shinzo abe is to blame for yukawa's death
you were given a deadline he says referring to isis earlier demand that japan pay two hundred million dollar by friday to save the lives of the two hostages
the voice then announces a new ultimatum
the release of sajida al rishawi an iraqi woman facing the death penalty in jordan for her role in a series of bombings in two thousand and five that killed dozens of people at hotels in the arab kingdom
abe said sunday that experts were analyzing the video but that it seemed highly credible
u.s. authorities said they had no reason to doubt its authenticity
an isis affiliated online radio station al <unk> reported that the recording was released by the extremist group
it also reported the killing of yukawa and the prisoner swap demand for goto in its <unk> sunday
it didn't identify goto by name
but goto's stepfather <unk> ishido raised doubts about whether it was his <unk> voice in the video
i get the sense it's not his voice he told reporters
i've heard his english a couple times
i felt it was a bit different
abe condemned the apparent killing of yukawa and called for goto to be released immediately
such act of terrorism is outrageous and <unk> which causes me nothing but strong indignation he said
but the japanese prime minister declined to comment on how his government would respond to the new demand which doesn't appear to have a clear deadline
after isis released the first video of the hostages tuesday japan set up a crisis center in jordan and said it was trying to communicate with the militant group through third parties such as governments in the region and tribal leaders
japanese officials declined to explicitly rule out paying a ransom but said they wouldn't yield to terrorism
they stressed that an aid package abe had pledged to countries affected by isis cited by the militant group as the reason for the huge ransom demand was only for humanitarian purposes
i would be surprised if the jordanian government or japan really pushed forward and released this female suicide bomber as isis has requested said cnn global affairs analyst david <unk> referring to al rishawi whose explosives failed to go off in the hotel attack in which she participated
cnn law enforcement analyst tom fuentes called the swap a <unk> noting that isis is already holding a jordanian pilot whose plane crashed in syria
jordan is part of the u.s. led coalition that's conducting airstrikes against isis targets
if there is any bargain going to be struck between jordan and isis it's going to include their pilot said fuentes a former fbi assistant director
<unk> <unk> the chief executive of south asia middle east consultants highlighted the high profile of al rishawi in jordan
this jordanian prisoner is probably the biggest terrorist prisoner that jordan has <unk> told cnn
to release her it's just going to require i think a lot more than just this one japanese hostage she said
yukawa forty two comes across as a lost soul who went to syria last year in search of purpose after suffering a series of setbacks in his life
over the past decade yukawa had attempted suicide lost his wife to cancer and then lost his home and business
after changing his first name to its <unk> form he said he believed he was the <unk> of a <unk> princess who spied on the japanese in world war ii
on a blog yukawa once wrote i look normal outside but inside i'm mentally ill
but his travels to syria appeared to have been an attempt to rebuild his life
he had dreams of setting up private security company
it was there that he met goto forty seven an experienced freelance journalist who frequently reported from war zones
goto has a wife and two young daughters in japan
despite their contrasting backgrounds the two apparently became friends in syria with goto helping show yukawa how to get by in a risky environment
after yukawa was reported to have been captured in august goto is believed to have decided to go into isis controlled territory with finding his friend among his goals
yukawa's father has expressed grief over his son's apparent killing
i have been praying such a thing would not happen but unfortunately it has finally come to pass and my heart aches shoichi yukawa said in an interview with japanese media
i feel so guilty that mr. goto has been detained and threatened death after he had entered there to rescue my son at the risk of his life he added
i wish him to be released and return to japan immediately and continue his activity
goto's mother made a plea to her son's captors to release him on friday saying he wasn't an enemy of isis
words fail to describe how i feel junko ishido said
kenji always has been a kind person ever since he was little
he was always saying i want to save the lives of children in war zones
u.s. president barack obama spoke with abe by phone sunday from new delhi the white house said
obama offered condolences for the murder of yukawa by isis and conveyed solidarity with the japanese people according to a statement
the u.n. security council said in a statement that it strongly condemns the apparent killing of yukawa describing it as a heinous and cowardly act
it demanded the immediate release of goto
british prime minister david cameron suggested japan was right not to bow to the terrorists demand for ransom saying that britain strongly supports the firm stance prime minister abe and his government have taken
the united states and britain both refuse to pay ransoms to terrorists
but other countries notably france have reportedly spent tens of millions of dollars on the release of hostages held by islamic militants in recent years despite denying it publicly
japan has also paid kidnappers to free its citizens in the past according to the new york times
in one thousand nine hundred and ninety nine tokyo handed over three million dollar for the release of four mining experts held in <unk> the newspaper reported
while miss colombia twenty two year old student <unk> <unk> took home the crown in miami on sunday night social media was more concerned with the fate of miss <unk>
there were boos when twenty two year old model kaci <unk> was announced as the fourth runner up
viewers immediately weighed in with why they felt miss <unk> had been robbed of the title citing everything from her race to her short <unk> amongst the flowing <unk> of other contestants

what does this victory mean for greece and for the debt ridden countries of southern europe
for greece this is a decisive step in the demise of pasok and new democracy the parties that have been in power for forty years
secondly it shows the failure of the political strategy pursued by the troika to implement austerity in southern europe by relying on centrist parties to form a cartel that is <unk> from voters
austerity is of course the main culprit for the death of traditional politics in greece
this is mainly because it has undermined the system of mass party <unk> on which the two traditional big parties on the center left and center right have relied on to alternate in power

for four decades politicians from both parties built their electoral success on the distribution of political spoils in exchange for votes
public sector jobs infrastructure projects protection from competitors through licensing and closed shops and social benefits targeted at particular occupations among other perks and benefits benefiting party supporters
pork barrel politics as it is known has long been the cornerstone of greek politics and also one of the causes of the deep economic problems it is facing now
this immensely costly system was able to survive at the cost of high inflation and currency <unk> or mounting public debt
but when the interest rates on government bonds shot up and debt could no longer be used to finance the spoils system greece was taken to the brink of bankruptcy
when the troika imposed a drastic program of austerity and liberalization pasok and new democracy were deprived of the very tools they had relied on for so long to stay in power
turning off the tap of public spending was like <unk> their own wrists
voters and their traditional <unk> abandoned them because they had no real ideological program other than running the state
this problem was particularly brutal for pasok which collapsed from nearly forty percents support before the crisis to four percents today
this opened up room for new challengers on the left promising a rupture with the old <unk> but also on the far right
the victory of syriza also signals the broader failure of the political strategy that has been employed to implement austerity in the debt ridden countries of southern europe a strategy best described as cartel politics
cartel politics involves the formation of political alliances between the ruling centrist parties to implement austerity
just as competing firms sometimes agree to fix prices or production levels competing political parties agree to put their ideological differences aside to cling to power together in spite of the huge unpopularity of the policies they put in place
this is essentially what happened in greece with the pasok new democracy government but also in italy with the <unk> cabinet of mario <unk> or the grand coalition of <unk> <unk> which united the center left democratic party and <unk> <unk> right wing <unk>
in portugal another country in dire economic conditions the socialist minority government of jos <unk> also benefited from the informal support of its main center right counterpart to carry out austerity measures and avoid a bailout
in spain the nascent rise of the left wing podemos party can also be explained by the lack of <unk> of center left and center right policies before and after the crisis even if it never <unk> in a de facto coalition
forming political cartels is understandable in a context where any party in office is bound to have to pass unpopular policies imposed by creditors that will cost votes and alienate a sizable share of the electorate
it is a good way to stay in office in the short term but it is a terrible way to keep votes in the medium and long term because no choice is presented to citizens
whoever they vote for the policies will be the same and they will be painful
<unk> and apathy grows and voters become attracted to challengers promising an alternative
as the electoral base of centrist parties <unk> the only way for them to remain in power is to band together to compensate for the loss of voters until this electoral base becomes too small to stay in government
syriza is the first challenger to break the greek political cartel
greece may be a special case because of the extent of its economic collapse but other movements elsewhere are also looming on the horizon
in spain podemos has been leading the polls in spite of the fact that it was created less than a year ago
in italy beppe grillo's five star movement has made a breakthrough in the last european elections
others will surge if politicians continue to believe that democracy can be put on hold to satisfy markets

if serena and venus williams who have combined to tally twenty five majors both win their quarterfinals wednesday they'll meet at a grand slam for the first time since the wimbledon final in two thousand and nine
but monday was already a day of firsts for venus williams whose career has been hindered by the autoimmune disorder <unk> syndrome
when the thirty four year old beat sixth seed <unk> <unk> six three two six six one she ensured a quarterfinal berth at a grand slam for the first time in five years
further it was her first top ten win at a major since downing italy's <unk> <unk> at the two thousand and ten u.s. open
of course i want to be playing deep in all my events venus williams told reporters
everybody wants that
but it really just doesn't happen every time for everyone
now is my moment and i want to keep this moment going all year and then next year too
that will take work
but reaching the quarterfinals in melbourne won't be enough for her
she still has the game and belief she said to go even deeper
i feel like i've been here before so it's not like i'm jumping up and down for joy oh shoot what is this
i've never done this she continued
yes i've done this
this is what i'm always going into each tournament thinking i want to do even when i fall short
it's definitely not the first time
i guess that's how i feel
serena williams cheered on her sibling from the players box during the victory over <unk> and said following her own win over <unk> <unk> that she was still inspired by venus

the leader of the left wing syriza party alexis tsipras was sworn in as greece's new prime minister on monday after forming a coalition with the right wing independent greeks party
tsipras has vowed to end austerity measures and renegotiate the terms of greece's european union bailout
since two thousand and ten greece has received bailouts <unk> two hundred and forty billion euros
in return the international monetary fund european commission and european central bank demanded tax hikes a freeze on state pensions bans on early retirement and deep cuts in government salaries
syriza's pledges to try to get some of greece's colossal debt written off and roll back unpopular austerity measures appealed to exasperated members of the electorate even if they potentially jeopardize greece's place in the <unk>
the party's victory could lead to a dramatic showdown with the debt laden nation's lenders
syriza's message is one that has also resonated in other southern european countries under the restrictions of international bailouts
its victory could boost other populist parties such as beppe grillo's anti euro five star movement in italy and the podemos movement in spain
declaring victory for syriza on sunday after polls showed it winning at least one hundred and forty nine seats in the three hundred seat parliament tsipras forty appeared to brace for a bigger battle
we are regaining our lost dignity
now that we are heard by all of europe we will fight with the same passion the same confidence he told cheering supporters
so let's go and let's all continue this beautiful and tough fight he said
greece leaves behind the austerity that ruined it leaves behind the fear leaves behind five years of humiliation and greece moves forward with optimism and hope and dignity he told the crowd
european central bank executive board member <unk> <unk> told cnn on monday that greece would still have to pay its debt
they have to pay
those are the european rules of the game
there is no room for unilateral action in europe that doesn't exclude a discussion for example on the <unk> of this debt
but i would like to <unk> that it's not the <unk> money it's the governments money
it's a discussion between mr. tsipras and the european governments
chief eu commission spokesman <unk> <unk> said it respected the sovereign choice of the greek people
we are ready to engage with the new government once it is formed
greece has made remarkable progress in recent years and we stand ready to continue to assist greece in addressing the remaining reform challenges he said
the austerity imposed by greece's international creditors has cut deep
unemployment has soared to twenty eight percents and many people who still have jobs have seen drastic decreases in wages pensions frozen and the retirement age pushed back
the governing new democracy party had pointed to recent improvements in economic indicators as signs that things were getting better
after conceding defeat sunday outgoing prime minister <unk> samaras said his conscience was clear
i got a country on the verge of ruin
i was asked to try and save it and i did it he said
most people did not believe we could stand strong but we did
now he said greece is secure and slowly walking away from the crisis
and more than anything he said i give back a country that is a member of the european parliament and the euro
on monday the ceo of one of greece's largest banks <unk> said syriza was coming to power at a fortunate time
the tide is changing in europe the macro is improving in greece the european central bank is launching an unprecedented easing and that will have a significant bearing on the fortunes of greece going forward <unk> <unk> said
greece has already gone through massive <unk> much of the hard work has already been completed the green shoots of recovery are already there so this is a great opportunity for greece a great opportunity for a new government
in his victory speech sunday tsipras noted that greece's election could have an impact far beyond his country's borders
our victory is at the same time it's a victory for all the people of europe that are fighting against austerity that's ruining the common european future he said
but it's unclear how syriza's plans to renegotiate the bailout would play out

given her well known love of horses it's perhaps fitting some might say <unk> that the majority of gifts presented to queen elizabeth ii from world leaders last year revolved her favorite four legged animals
dog lovers look away now her <unk> iconic pet <unk> didn't even get a look in
included in the two thousand and fourteen list of gifts was a mounted sculpture of a white horse from france's president francois hollande
a bronze sculpture of a <unk> head from the emir of qatar
and another bronze <unk> of the famous irish <unk> <unk> from the president of ireland michael <unk> along with a book of the same name
a <unk> crop from the governor general of canada david johnston and a boot <unk> from <unk> school in the east of england can also be put to good use at her <unk> <unk> farm on the royal <unk> estate
among the more peculiar gifts given to the queen was a miniature seven inch throne from the game of thrones tv series during a visit to northern ireland in june
however it's far from the most outlandish present bestowed upon the monarch
during her sixty two year long reign the queen has received a <unk> from brazil two giant <unk> from the <unk> an elephant from cameroon and several horses most notably a beloved black mare called burmese from the royal canadian mounted police
indeed the queen rode burmese at the traditional <unk> the color parade for eighteen consecutive years and in two thousand and five unveiled a bronze statue of herself atop the horse outside the saskatchewan legislative building in canada
but what happens to the many gifts her <unk> receives throughout the year that aren't to her taste
live animals are donated to london zoo <unk> items such as food and flowers are given to local <unk> and all other presents which don't go on display in the royal <unk> are stored at the royal archive at windsor castle a <unk> house spokesperson told cnn
some items are even loaned to galleries such as a <unk> canoe given by the new zealand government which is now on display at the british museum
when it comes to royal presents the queen's great grandson prince george recorded the largest haul in two thousand and fourteen
during a tour of australia and new zealand with his parents the duke and duchess of cambridge the toddler received a <unk> <unk> <unk> skin cloak and more soft toys than other children would get in a lifetime of <unk>
<unk> the previous year prince george also received a teddy wearing the same silk jacket as those worn by the queen's <unk> from promotional group great british racing
will the young prince also <unk> a love of horse racing passed down through the centuries
indeed legend has it queen victoria became so excited while watching a race at ascot one time that she broke the window of the royal box in a rush to see the finish
queen elizabeth ii was more contained than her great great grandmother though still visibly delighted when her own horse estimate won britain's prestigious gold cup race in two thousand and thirteen
so what would one buy for the horse racing mad monarch that hasn't been bought before
the ultimate gift would be a nomination to galileo or <unk> the two most expensive <unk> in the world said nick <unk> from great british racing of the chance to mate a mare with some of the most prized <unk> on the planet
a mare mating with <unk> including a live <unk> guarantee would cost someone one hundred and twenty five thousand
at that price it's a gift fit for a queen
the drone's owner and operator works for the national geospatial intelligence agency a government entity with mapping and national security duties
the agency confirmed in a statement issued on tuesday one of its employees was the operator of the drone that crashed by the white house
the employee was off duty and the drone flight was not work related according to the statement
he was interviewed by secret service agents on monday and has been fully cooperative secret service spokesman brian leary said in a statement monday afternoon
initial indications are that this incident occurred as a result of recreational use of the device leary said
the secret service locked down the white house shortly after three a.m. after an officer on the south grounds of the white house spotted the drone described as a two foot wide quad copter flying above the white house grounds before crashing on the southeast side of the complex
the officer saw the drone flying at a very low altitude
the drone was believed to have flown over the white house residence after taking off in a neighborhood east of the white house a secret service source told cnn
a second source said the flight path had not been fully confirmed by investigators
the secret service will continue to investigate the incident through <unk> interviews forensic examinations and reviews of all other investigative leads leary said
a secret service official said the owner of the drone called in after seeing reports of the drone on the news
the secret service was sweeping the white house grounds on monday morning looking for anything else that might be on the ground
president barack obama and the first lady are both away traveling in india

no you can't fly drones over the white house
the executive director of the small uav coalition michael drobac called the news of the drone crashing at the white house a terrible incident for the drone industry because it sends a message that drone users aren't using the technology responsibly
but the vast majority of the at least half million drone users in the u.s. are drobac said citing a conservative estimate
the problem is bad actors he said and the industry is working with the faa to educate new users about the rules for operating drones
and the industry is developing new technologies to prevent users from operating drones in unauthorized spaces
some of the newest models of recreational drones won't turn on in unauthorized areas like within five miles of an airport drobac said
technology is going to help solve the problem and is already doing it
i trust technology over rogue operators he said
flying drones is illegal in the district of columbia but that hasn't always kept them out of the capital's skies
the secret service previously detained an individual operating a quadcopter drone on july three in president's park just a block from the south lawn of the white house according to a report filed with the federal aviation administration
another person was detained by the u.s. capitol police for flying a drone on the capitol hill grounds
and in october a drone was spotted above <unk> <unk> air force base
a surge in interest in drones and how they should be regulated even brought one to capitol hill inside a committee room no less
congressmen watched in awe as robotics company executive flew a drone inside the committee room during a house science space and technology committee hearing on integrating commercial drones
the drone even crashed in the committee room though it did recover
the secret service patrolling the grounds of the white house has been in the national spotlight for the past year ever since a man managed to hop the fence and get inside the white house itself through an unlocked door
the incident led to the resignation of the secret service's director and reassignment of other top level officials
an independent report commissioned by the department of homeland security said in its executive summary said the department was stretched beyond its limits late last year
it's a message world leaders and diplomats working with the u.s. to <unk> iran into <unk> its nuclear weapons program have echoed
but none of that is stopping sanctions advocates in the senate who will mark up their latest piece of legislation in committee this week bringing the bill one step closer to action on the senate floor
read
what's happening in the middle east and why it matters
and as negotiators <unk> talks with iran in geneva sen. robert menendez the lead democratic sponsor of the sanctions bill accused the white house of peddling talking points straight out of tehran
throw israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu's upcoming visit into the mix a couple veto threats and you've got a bona fide washington showdown
why does this all sound so familiar
because it is
congressional republicans and a dozen democrats bolstered by the powerhouse pro israel lobby aipac faced off against the white house and dozens of pro peace groups last year when they tried passing the a sanctions bill
the bill earned on the record support from sixty senators just enough to override a filibuster but the bill never got a vote after the white house issued a veto threat and went on a lobbying spree urging democrats to oppose it
the november midterm election changed the dynamics republicans snagged the senate majority and iran sanctions were suddenly back on the table handing advocates a pretty easy path to sixty votes and even a chance of reaching a veto proof majority

obama <unk> the new iran sanctions bill
menendez and his republican counterpart sen. mark kirk of illinois got to work on changing their bill to make it more <unk> to democrats
obama though rushed to issue a new veto threat even before the new draft legislation even went public
how did they change the bill and why does obama still hate it
last year's bill would have crashed right onto the negotiating table where iran and delegations from six countries were <unk> over its nuclear program immediately dropping new sanctions on iran and likely killing the talks
senate staffers and their bosses have stripped away the most divisive provisions though stronger language could always get added to the new <unk> down bill as it winds its way through the legislative process
but even in its current form obama is urging congress to stand down
negotiators argue any measure from congress would threaten to unravel the fragile international coalition they believe is the world's best shot at peacefully ending iran's nuclear program
the iranians could feel like threatened or bullied by sanctions legislation prompting them to ditch the negotiating table
and then they can blame the u.s. congress for undoing a potential deal a blame game many countries would buy
obama also counters that if talks break down he will swiftly impose new sanctions on iran sanctions he could quickly get congress to vote and pass
world leaders are also <unk> with obama british prime minister david cameron even pounded out phone calls to a slew of senators during his trip to washington last week in an unusual move from a foreign leader
what's congress deal
why are they pushing sanctions
even though there haven't been any new sanctions iran is already under increased economic strain as oil prices have plummeted in recent months and no one is expecting them to rise anytime soon
but the sanctions <unk> say the threat of new sanctions will pin iran against a wall and force them to deal in good faith
the iranian economy is still struggling but has been making strides experiencing some economic growth and lowering inflation after facing a recession
while the obama administration had argued that sanctions relief would have a minimal impact the imf assessed in its two thousand and fourteen report that the sanctions relief helped iran stabilize its oil exports and gain access to funds held abroad
kirk and menendez say they want to strengthen the hand of negotiators and promise that the threat of new sanctions will do just that
sanctions got the iranians to the negotiating table in the first place and iran's only going to agree to a deal that actually rolls back its nuclear program for good if it's under serious pressure they argue
sounds logical
but is there another side to this
the pro sanction side had also been accused of having no faith in a negotiated solution and pushing the u.s. to the brink of war by <unk> negotiations
while leading advocates like kirk menendez and democratic heavyweight sen. chuck schumer <unk> those claims others don't shy away from that characterization
freshman sen. tom cotton r arkansas a member of the intelligence and armed services committees boldly stated this month that the goal of a sanctions bill was to kill the negotiations he believes are leading nowhere
the end of these negotiations isn't an unintended consequence of congressional action
it is very much an intended consequence a feature not a bug cotton said calling for immediate and crippling sanctions
israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu has also argued that a negotiated solution with iran is impossible
he accepted congressional republicans invitation to address congress this spring over the iranian threat
that sent the white house into a <unk>
netanyahu not only scheduled a speech to congress that is expected to fly in the face of obama's diplomatic efforts but the announcement of netanyahu's speech also came without any prior outreach to the white house
so what happens if talks actually collapse
if talks fall apart the u.s. and the international community would lose the access it's gained to monitor most of iran's nuclear facilities and iran would no longer be constrained to a uranium enrichment threshold as it has under the terms of the current negotiations
that's why many argue that even if negotiations don't result in a deal the status quo is better than the alternative
failed talks would send iran's nuclear program underground so to speak and sound alarm bells in israel the u.s. and other western countries
israel has already made clear it's willing to do anything it takes to prevent iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon and promised to act unilaterally if necessary
obama has insisted the u.s. would not be on an immediate war footing if negotiations fail but he and other u.s. leaders have said nuclear iran isn't an option
and saudi arabia and its gulf neighbors also won't stand idly by if their top geopolitical foe works to <unk> a nuclear bomb
so the stakes are pretty high
are there any alternatives
a couple
sen. bob corker r tennessee the new chairman of the senate foreign relations committee is crafting a bill that would give congress oversight power over an eventual agreement with iran
some in the senate are starting to view it as an alternative to the sanctions bill
while <unk> proposal hasn't faced the same forceful opposition from the white house the obama administration would rather have congress as far away as possible from the sensitive negotiations
also in the works
an alternative sanctions bill being crafted by sen. barbara boxer a leading progressive and conservative sen. rand paul which could be the only bill ultimately endorsed by the white house
it's unlikely boxer who has consistently opposed sanctions efforts would push a bill the white house isn't on board with
<unk> of those two bills have yet to go public but the corker effort in particular is starting to draw support and could split republicans looking to bolster the negotiations
so what's the next step
the senate banking committee is holding a hearing on tuesday and then will review the kirk menendez sanctions measure on thursday
but this is one fight that will push on for weeks with no clear outcome in sight
informed by the remarkable rise of their own head teacher to the summit of nigeria's cosmetics industry the students for the most part young women in their twenty s and thirty s are being taught that makeup artistry can be their passport to self confidence independence and a business of their own
making a difference to young lives is all part of the mission for thirty seven year old cosmetics queen tara fela durotoye
there are certain things telling you that you can not make it
that you will not make it
that nigeria is not a place where people make it says fela durotoye
i beg to differ
fela durotoye is the ceo of house of tara international a household name in her native lagos where the company develops makeup <unk> and accessories that <unk> the western centered tastes of the big cosmetic firms in favor of products designed specifically for nigeria's women
in one thousand nine hundred and ninety eight aged twenty one fela durotoye was already on her way to becoming a qualified lawyer when she launched house of tara as a makeup studio at first specializing in makeup designs for <unk> and their wedding parties
her artistry proved a hit with nigeria's booming middle class and today the company employs over three thousand beauty reps across west africa
she says she was drawn to cosmetics by her inspirational step mother by seeing what makeup actually does to a woman in terms of self esteem and confidence
the tara beauty range was born out of her frustration at the lack of suitable cosmetics available in nigeria <unk> didn't know exactly what was right for nigerian women she says and sense that her products could fill the gap while encouraging pride in home grown glamor
a lot of the tara products are named after either beauty icons or beauty <unk> in africa says fela durotoye
for us it's about sharing the world and sharing our culture to the world
the past few years have seen the company expand into <unk> and film makeup design as lagos fashion and cinema scenes have flourished
when french pharmaceutical giants l'oreal came to nigeria looking for a partner to help introduce their <unk> range to the west african country they signed up with tara earning fela durotoye a spot on forbes list of twenty young power women in africa in the process
as a child fela durotoye remembers visiting her grandmother and gathering with the children from the local village to pass on lessons she'd learned at school
she always teased about how she expected me to be a teacher recalls fela durotoye
and i would say that she was correct
grandma was correct she continues
i am still a teacher the only thing is this time i'm not teaching <unk> or english
i'm teaching enterprise
i'm teaching makeup artistry as a platform for enterprise
fela <unk> fourteen schools teach a range of courses from short personal makeup courses to professional <unk> in makeup artistry
when she founded the schools a decade ago she says few considered makeup to be a serious career prospect with parents pushing children toward professions like law medicine and <unk>
but with nigeria's economy growing the market for little <unk> such as cosmetics and demand for trained makeup artists for weddings film and everyday life has seen a rise
today fela durotoye makes the lofty estimate that eighty percents of nigeria's makeup artists were trained by house of tara
fela durotoye says she sees each student as a potential small business owner and her courses teach knowledge of the beauty industry plus customer service and business ethics skills in addition to practical beauty essentials
the aim is to <unk> graduates with everything they need to launch their own beauty store and past graduates have gone on to start small firms that employ a handful of other makeup artists
if it seems strange for makeup artist fela durotoye to be training thousands of competitors she says you'd be missing the point

jeremy <unk> who sells socks with the <unk> pattern through his online store the athletic community says the item has been a best seller from the start
my wife and i joke about it all the time because when i made the initial order of seventy two pair of socks she was let's just say not that stoked about having that many pairs of teal socks lying around our apartment
but they sold out in the first hour that we posted them on our instagram accounts he said
the impending demise of the carpet has also inspired a facebook page three twitter accounts and an instagram account all run independently by carpet <unk>
<unk> <unk> who manages the <unk> carpet facebook page notes that the carpet has a certain je ne <unk> <unk>
it seems like in most places the carpet is there to fade into the background but this has such a bright cheerful eye grabbing pattern
it's also a symbol of making it home explains <unk>
it's also ugly but in a really cute <unk> way and portland seems to love that
despite the rampant nostalgia for the old floor covering <unk> says the carpet is overdue for a replacement
we're starting to see more than general wear and tear
the <unk> are showing and you're seeing frayed edges
in some spots it's so thread bear the underlying mat <unk> through she says
it's been on the floor for more than twenty years
someone did a calculation and figured about three hundred million people have passed over it
the new carpet design created by <unk> <unk> architects hasn't quite received the same love
i get that the old design is cool
it's kind of <unk> one thousand nine hundred and eighty s and it's like an old friend we don't want to leave behind but it's ok to have a new friend too says michelle <unk> principal at <unk> <unk>

the fluorescent blue glow is natural lighting powered by an algae bloom of <unk> <unk> commonly known as sea <unk>
the non toxic <unk> is not considered harmful and is relatively common in hong kong
what is uncommon is capturing its <unk> glow on camera which only appears when the water is disturbed
local photographer lit <unk> <unk> also took an image of the phenomena at tai <unk> in hong kong's new territories
you can see the blue light if there is a wave a boat moving or a stone thrown in the water said <unk> who used a thirty second exposure to get the shot
there was no blue light when the water was calm therefore many people threw stones into the water in order to see it
despite its blue hue the phenomena is referred to as a red tide and according to a hong kong government website that keeps track of sightings several have been reported so far this year
michelle cheung from the city's eco education and resources center said the bloom was caused by high pollution in <unk> <unk> which was exacerbated by the slow flow of currents
she said nutrient levels are typically high in the region due to restaurant waste and sewage running direct from village houses into the sea
cheung added that the algae can be deadly because it <unk> the water of oxygen though the government has not recorded any evidence of fish kills
hong kong and the entire pearl river delta has a big problem with wastewater and that is surely a factor with these <unk> <unk> said david baker from the <unk> institute of marine science at the university of hong kong
he said by itself <unk> <unk> doesn't represent a threat to human or environmental health but the huge bloom does represent an ecosystem that's out of balance
i guess the analogy is they're like <unk> that feed on agricultural crops
and once they find a good abundant food source they will multiply until the food source is exhausted
in hong kong unfortunately most of the nutrients are coming from our own sewage
the damage done to the environment doesn't just happen when oxygen is depleted during the <unk> short lifetime
when the <unk> die they sink to the bottom of the sea when they <unk> consuming huge amounts of oxygen
that's when we have the formation of these dead zones where anything that's living any fish or crab species living on the bottom is at risk of dying from the low oxygen associated with that <unk> baker said
hong kong has a number of zones that suffer from persistently low levels of oxygen which increase in their severity and their scope whenever we have these <unk> <unk> he added
hundreds of boko haram gunmen launched a <unk> attack sunday on maiduguri the capital of borno state
soldiers repelled the attacks and officials have since eased a curfew imposed as a result said col. <unk> usman a military spokesman
but a simultaneous attack on nearby monguno town was a different story
the islamist militants captured the town together with its military barracks a nigerian military officer said
it's unclear how many people were wounded or killed during the battle for the two cities
our soldiers initially repelled the terrorists but they mobilized more fighters and came back in full force
they overwhelmed our troops and forced them to retreat the military officer said
he asked not to be named because he's not authorized to speak to the media
monguno is about one hundred and thirty five kilometers from maiduguri
the former has a population of one hundred thousand while maiduguri has about six hundred thousand
both cities are near the chad and cameroon borders which would give the militants an entry point into those countries
monguno and its military post served as a buffer to keep the militants away from maiduguri
its fall leaves maiduguri vulnerable and puts the extremists in a better position to seize the city
boko haram had been confined to the fishing town of baga since its fighters seized it on january three
thousands were feared killed in that attack which lasted days
borno gov
<unk> shettima said soldiers will continue their crackdown on the militants
so long as we have the resources we will continue to regard the efforts to reclaim peace our no
one area of commitments he said
i want to reassure the good people of borno state that we will never <unk> from our responsibility as those they entrusted with leadership
the attack came a day after president goodluck jonathan made a campaign stop in maiduguri ahead of the february fourteen presidential election
u.s. secretary of state john kerry was also in the nation sunday to call for peaceful elections
boko haram has terrorized northern nigeria regularly since two thousand and nine attacking police schools churches and civilians and bombing government buildings
the islamist group has said its aim is to impose a stricter form of sharia law across nigeria which is split between a majority muslim north and a mostly christian south

grisly footage purporting to be of the aftermath of the battle was circulated online showing uniformed bodies <unk> in a rice field
this is the single largest loss of life in recent memory secretary of the department of interior and local government <unk> roxas told the press conference calling for a moment of silence from assembled reporters
these saf operatives are fallen heroes
they were just doing their job
that is why we salute them
roxas said that three hundred and ninety two saf commandos been engaged to hunt malaysian bomb maker and <unk> <unk> leader <unk> bin <unk> known as marwan and filipino bomb maker abdul <unk> usman
the fbi says that marwan who is suspected of having conducted bomb making training for abu <unk> and has a five million dollar state department bounty for information leading to his arrest is believed to have been hiding in the country's south since two thousand and three
the u.s. government is also offering a reward of up to one million dollar for information leading to <unk> arrest
roxas said the commandos were <unk> from the assault on their targets when they came under fire from members of the biff
in maneuvering away from the biff assault they <unk> into territory controlled by the milf several kilometers away and a <unk> ensued
the government had not been seeking to sabotage the peace agreement with the milf by carrying out the operation without their knowledge he said
we are hopeful and confident that this will not derail the peace talks he said
this was not directed against milf but this is directed against a very very specific high profile terrorist bomber who was in the area
espina said that it was most highly likely that marwan has been killed in the saf assault and dna testing was being carried out to confirm this
but initial reports suggested that usman had fled
a board of inquiry would conduct an investigation into the operation including looking into the apparent lack of coordination with milf forces in the area said espina
<unk> <unk> chief negotiator for the milf said in an interview with philippine radio station <unk> that a lack of coordination between the milf ceasefire committee and the government was to blame for the outbreak of violence
it was a standard operating procedure that one side should notify the other before they began an operation he said describing the incident as self defense
while the area where the fighting occurred was mostly under milf control he said biff which was also involved in the firefight was a mobile group moving throughout the region
chances are they were just there when it happened he said
he said his group was doing everything it could to ease tensions over the fighting and that the incident would not have an effect on the ongoing peace process
the philippines signed an agreement with the milf the largest rebel group in the south in march last year
the deal offered greater autonomy economic and political power in return for the rebels <unk> their weapons and ending a decades long insurgency
but hardline rebel groups opposed to the peace process such as the biff remain active
lieutenant colonel harold <unk> public affairs office chief for the armed forces of the philippines appealed to the hardline biff group monday to return any personnel under their control
we are also calling on our brothers in the bangsamoro islamic freedom fighters that if indeed they are still holding some of the <unk> personnel they must respect their rights and they must be returned to their mother units and ultimately to their family members he told reporters
miriam <unk> ferrer chair of the government panel responsible for overseeing the peace process with muslim insurgents said in a statement monday that the violence highlighted the challenges that <unk> the peace process
but the outbreak only strengthened the resolve of the peace panel to implement the bangsamoro basic law the bill currently being heard by politicians that seeks to implement the peace deal between the government and the milf
hearings of the bill were suspended monday following the violence
with better cooperation we will be able to prevent these kinds of incidents she said

<unk> claimed the next eight points and <unk> did as he promised in a later match at the season's final major
no commentators were believed to have said something similar when stan wawrinka trailed <unk> garcia lopez five zero and six two in a fourth set tiebreak monday at the australian open and lucky for them
just like <unk> wawrinka did the almost <unk> and pulled off a great escape
the defending champion at the year's opening grand slam saved five set points in the tiebreak to close out the encounter against the spaniard seven six six four four six seven six and advance to the quarterfinals
losing five zero was a bad start to the tiebreak wawrinka upset by garcia lopez at the two thousand and fourteen french open told reporters
at six two i knew it was close to come back because i had the wind with me
i had to focus on every point
i knew if i was going to come back six five was going to get nervous
just focused point after point
wawrinka is flying the swiss flag after roger federer's surprising loss to andreas seppi in the third round and the world no
four will have to maintain or increase his level if he is to continue his winning streak at melbourne park
<unk> quarterfinal opponent kei nishikori beat the twenty nine year old in the last eight in september en route to making the final at the u.s. open
i'm happy the way i'm playing so far wawrinka said
i'm ready for the tournament
my game is there
i didn't spend too much energy on the court since one week
i'm happy to get the chance to play one more quarterfinal
nishikori did something rare later monday on australia day when he downed david ferrer six three six three six three
only rafael nadal and novak djokovic had beaten the spaniard one of the game's top competitors in straight sets at a hard court or clay court major since the beginning of two thousand and eleven
it was also the first time nishikori defeated ferrer in straight sets his previous six victories all going the distance
world no
one djokovic going for a fifth australian open title will take on canada's <unk> raonic in the quarterfinals
djokovic overcame <unk> <unk> in straight sets
raonic meanwhile eliminated <unk> lopez in five sets
lopez saved match points in two encounters earlier in the fortnight and saved another versus raonic in the fourth set
but raonic took the fifth six three to prevent a rare hat trick
for the third straight match women's top seed serena williams survived an early <unk> to progress
she saved three set points in the first set against <unk> <unk> lost the first set against <unk> <unk> and then lost the first set to <unk> <unk> her <unk> at the french open on monday
but williams upped her game despite dealing with a cough and got a bit of luck in the third set to oust the big flat hitting twenty four th seed two six six three six two in the fourth round
i've been playing for a long time williams bidding for a nineteen th major but first in australia in five years told reporters
when i have to go up a level i have to
i can't afford to stay at the same level or i will be where i was at the french open
i definitely didn't want to be there without at least trying to give one thousand percents
still the match might have turned out differently had <unk> not missed a routine volley on break point when leading one zero in the third
i knew that if i won this game i would have more chances to win the third set because break her serve it's difficult said <unk>
i wanted to use that opportunity but i couldn't
williams returned to the rod laver arena later on monday rooting on older sister venus
and she left in good spirits since venus williams upset sixth seed <unk> <unk> six three two six six one to make a first grand slam quarterfinal in five years
venus williams too hadn't beaten a top ten player at a major since the two thousand and ten u.s. open
she really had answers for everything today said <unk>
when victoria azarenka upset caroline wozniacki in the second round most would have expected serena williams to face the two time australian open winner in the quarterfinals
madison keys who sent wimbledon champion petra kvitova packing reached her first grand slam quarterfinal by beating compatriot madison <unk> six two six four

you can't fight mother nature and whatever happens throughout the course of the storm we just have to do our best to be prepared going into it which i think we are walsh said
on plum island massachusetts bob connors said he'll try to ride out the storm but will move to higher ground if things get <unk> according to cnn affiliate <unk>
a two thousand and thirteen storm destroyed homes on the island
when you're living on the edge of paradise like we are now you give mother nature a lot of respect when we need to said connors
visibility will be a major problem said cnn meteorologist <unk> jones
this is not one of those storms you want to go out in while it's happening jones said
you want to wait for the winds to die down
before you go to the store
tuesday is shaping up to be a day when the reality of the weather sets in
one of the inevitable <unk> of snow flooding will quickly become a problem
there could be coastal flooding in massachusetts starting early tuesday with pockets of major flooding on east facing <unk> the state emergency agency said
plan to work from home is the best advice for tuesday jones said
the three adults distracted sales staff by pretending to browse for items in a branch of emperor watch and jewelry a chain store popular with chinese tourists on friday afternoon while a girl estimated to be aged between twelve and fourteen years pocketed a one hundred and seventeen <unk> diamond necklace from a store front display cabinet police told cnn
while exact details of how the girl <unk> the necklace are still under investigation local media reports said the girl stole a key from a <unk> to open the display cabinet while the adult accomplices kept staff busy
the three adults posed as big <unk> and demanded employees show them jewelry in an apparent move to divert staff attention an anonymous police source told the south china morning post
according to security footage stills a girl appears walking calmly out of the mall with her hands stuffed in the pockets of her <unk> hooded sweatshirt
since the robbery extra security guards have been deployed outside the store
a spokesperson from the jewelry store told cnn business continued as usual
our first and foremost priority is to comply with the police investigation but we still have to wait for the results to see what measures can be taken to strengthen the security level he said
as the nation choked on its <unk> many took to social media to express shock and dismay and repeat the question is this a joke
at an australia day function in <unk> abbott was forced to defend his decision and dismissed the reaction on twitter as electronic graffiti
i think that in the media you make a big mistake to pay too much attention to social media
you wouldn't report what's sprayed up on the walls of buildings abbott was quoted as saying in the sydney morning herald
of prince philip abbott said
he's the patron of hundreds of organizations
he's the inspiration and <unk> of the duke of <unk> awards which have provided leadership training for tens if not hundreds of thousands of australians over the years
the ninety three year old duke is the only son of prince andrew of greece whose ancestors hail from danish royalty
he married in queen elizabeth ii in one thousand nine hundred and forty seven who is head of the commonwealth and is required to sign off on <unk> decision an irony not lost on australia's <unk>
gift for santa
more like a gift to republicans some said
abbott <unk> <unk> and <unk> last year twenty eight years after they were retired under the leadership of bob <unk> labor government
at the time abbott said the honor of becoming a knight and dame of the order of australia would be extended to australians of extraordinary and pre eminent achievement and merit
my intention is that this new award will go to those who have accepted public office rather than sought it and who can never by virtue of that office ever entirely return to private life he said
so far only one dame and three <unk> have been appointed including air chief marshal sir angus houston who has most recently led operations to recover lost malaysian flights mh three hundred and seventy and mh seventeen
opposition leader bill shorten said australia had entered a <unk> to extend the honor to english royalty
it's not about him but he's a british royal why would we give him our top australian honor
he's already got a lot of them he said
some wondered how prince philip would react to the announcement
for others it was an opportunity to revive some the <unk> famous quotes
some thought it was sure sign phil could take some of australia's other top honors
and then there was the lone voice calling for calm
sort of
at the time of writing buckingham palace had yet to release an official statement
though its twitter account posted a link to learn more about the australian royal family
abbott didn't take to twitter to try to stifle the spray of e graffiti
his contribution to the great wall of outrage was a simple
not likely <unk> says
on the tv side the winners included orange is the new black a series about a women's prison created by a woman featuring a cast that includes a transgender performer and black <unk> <unk> davis and <unk> <unk>
and the movie winners included patricia arquette who won for a performance in boyhood that she filmed over twelve years and wasn't afraid to show it
arquette comes from a long line of performers
her siblings including <unk> arquette and david arquette are actors
so was her father and grandfather
she paid tribute to all of them in her speech
i'm a fourth generation actor she said visibly <unk> adding that her family has been performing for more than a century
but it was the wins by davis <unk> and orange that caught the attention of social media which erupted ten days ago when the oscar nominations put forth a very un diverse crowd
davis speech in particular was particularly moving
after beginning with an observation about how she tells her daughter stories she paid tribute to the producers who thought of her for their how to get away with murder story
i'd like to thank paul lee <unk> <unk> <unk> beers and pete <unk> for thinking that a <unk> messy mysterious woman could be a forty nine year old dark skinned african american woman who looks like me she said
several <unk> highlighted her words and their significance
in general however the sag awards were a relatively quiet and <unk> affair
the film awards generally went as expected with arquette j.k. simmons <unk> moore eddie redmayne and birdman taking home the trophies
only redmayne was a mild surprise given that <unk> michael keaton has been considered the leader in the best actor race by a number of <unk>
the actors branch is the largest bloc of oscar voters so the sag awards are closely watched for indicators about which way the academy award wind is blowing
still the sag awards had their moments
there were davis and <unk> emotional speeches of course
and there were also a few laughs
<unk> <unk> got some <unk> for turning her speech into a cheeky bit of promotion for her film olive <unk> and the <unk> carrie fisher got off a couple jokes while introducing her mother debbie reynolds who won a lifetime achievement award
birdman took home only one prize in the end but it was the biggest one of the night
it also won at the producers <unk> awards saturday
how that will fly at the oscars however is anyone's guess
unlike smoking however we can't just quit sitting
it's a lifestyle reality that even the most athletic among us can't avoid
my professional athlete clientele are plagued by prolonged sitting as they travel from game to game
they also end up sitting a lot during downtime at hotels and in the off season
so how can we limit our death by sitting risk
sit smarter with yoga
just as yoga is a practice based on mindfulness so is sitting smarter
that's why i coach my clients to become more mindful of their sitting habits
notice your posture
be aware of your breath
and know when it's time to move
of course awareness is only the first step
here are some quick easy yoga based tips to give your sitting a healthy overhaul
one
feet and knees
place your feet hip distance apart with your knees at hip level
keeping an even pressure through the inside arches and outside heels of your feet helps maintain neutral knee and hip position
avoid crossing your legs or ankles which can stifle blood flow and cause swelling
two
hips and pelvis
evenly distribute your weight through your sitting bones the bony parts of your pelvis you can feel making contacting with your seat
our feet and knees indicate and affect our hip position so avoid letting a foot or knee drift forward taking the hips out of balance
three
back and spine
maintain the natural curves of your spine don't try to <unk> it
your mid back curve is naturally <unk> which means hump in greek
your low back is <unk> so it curves into some extension
keep spinal curves soft not exaggerated
four
shoulders and chest
your chest should be open with your shoulders sitting evenly
concentrate on pulling the bottom points of your shoulder blades downward rather than inward
it's a common mistake to squeeze your shoulder blades together and puff your chest out which lifts your rib cage arches your mid back and decreases your ability to breathe deeply
five
head and neck
align your head and neck between your shoulders rather than <unk> into text neck
the action of engaging muscles to draw the shoulder blades down in point no
four helps position your head properly by initiating a muscular action called <unk> <unk> which turns off the overactive neck upper back and chest muscles that tend to pull your neck forward
how you breathe affects how you sit
breathing quality dictates rib cage position which affects your shoulder and chest position
if your breathing is shallow it feeds poor posture
the <unk> is not just a breathing muscle
it's also a core postural muscle that attaches to your lumbar spine and runs through your hip flexors
because it has a longer <unk> attachment to your spine on the right when it's dysfunctional it can pull you into sitting more on your right side leading to and or <unk> sciatica
<unk>
for the postural reasons above as well as increased <unk> and stress relief practice deep <unk> breathing whenever you're seated
focus on inhaling through your nose into the bottom and back of your lungs
exhale slowly and fully internally rotating the bottom ribs and releasing the rib cage downward by engaging core muscles
<unk> like this feels fantastic and also promotes low back stability
it's not a matter of standing versus sitting
studies also point to health dangers of too much standing
instead alternate your position frequently
according to dr. joan <unk> former nasa director of life sciences and the author of sitting kills moving <unk> it's ideal to change your posture every fifteen to twenty minutes throughout the day
healthy muscle function is the only way to support good posture and alleviate the pain caused by bad sitting practices
that's why i recommend practicing specific yoga poses to reduce tension and help reset postural alignment
poses that address hip back and upper body tension are especially helpful for <unk> the effects of sitting
these are two good examples
one
warrior one is a basic standing yoga pose that lengthens the upper body while stretching hip flexors and stabilizing the low back
from standing step back into a lunge but drop your back heel and point your toes out forty five degrees
keep your back leg straight with your forward knee <unk> above your ankle
lift your arms overhead shoulder distance apart
hold for three to five long deep breaths
repeat on the other side
two
kneeling lunge with reach back twist stretches hip flexors while releasing chest neck and upper back tension
from a kneeling lunge with your left foot forward place your right hand on your left thigh
reach your left arm behind you with your <unk> and palm turned up
look back over your shoulder as you draw your right shoulder blade down relaxing the muscles of your neck and chest
hold for three to five long deep breaths
repeat on the other side
note
the reach back twist can be done sans lunge simply from standing or sitting
mindfulness is paramount to sitting healthier but it's understandable that we <unk> during sedentary activities such as watching tv reading or working at a desk
it's helpful to set a <unk> to remind you to keep your sitting in check
technology such as computers tablets and smartphones might be a big reason we're in our seats so much but it can also help
there are some innovative posture correcting apps such as posture trainer and wearable technology such as <unk> lift
i'm on the advisory board of <unk> a company creating the world's first smart seat cushion to monitor your real time posture <unk> and stress level and cue you via an app to apply all the principles i outlined above
on logging into <unk> dot com on monday morning users were presented with an image of a malaysia airlines airbus and messages that read four hundred and four plane not found and hacked by lizard squad official cyber caliphate
the browser tab also read isis will prevail
the malaysia airlines homepage later changed to a black background featuring a mocked up image of a lizard in a top hat complete with <unk>
users were directed to a twitter page called <unk> which featured a series of largely <unk> posts
the airline which is currently <unk> itself in the wake of the loss of two of its airliners last year could not be contacted by telephone
in a post on its facebook account the airline denied its internal servers which contain passenger information had been compromised
it said its domain name system had instead been hijacked with users <unk> to the hackers website
the airline added the issue has now been resolved with its service provider and the system is expected to be fully recovered within twenty two hours
the matter has also been reported to malaysian authorities it said
but the hackers identifying themselves as the lizard squad took to twitter claiming they had <unk> malaysia airlines email account and posted a <unk>
meanwhile tweets from the airline's official account directed users to a separate <unk> for its online booking service

eddie redmayne who played hawking in the theory of everything beat former batman michael keaton for lead actor in a film at the sag awards sunday
it's such an extraordinary year he began before reeling off the other nominees in the category as well as some like bradley cooper and david <unk> who didn't make the sag award cut
redmayne also dedicated his award to those with als like hawking and their families
their <unk> spirit blew my mind redmayne said
the actors form the largest branch of academy voters so redmayne now has some front runner credibility
miss lebanon and miss israel were at an event in los angeles with fellow two thousand and six miss universe contestants as part of the whirlwind of photo <unk> leading up the annual beauty contest
it was in the middle of the two thousand and six israel hezbollah war and a picture of the two women together landed on the miss universe press page stirring panic among the women and their handlers
the incident came to mind last weekend when a photo on instagram of the current miss israel and miss lebanon together stirred controversy online <unk> miss universe organization president paula m. <unk> said
in two thousand and six the organization was able to remove the photo before anyone noticed <unk> said
now thanks to social media we're in a whole new <unk>
slips in <unk> that previously might have gone unnoticed now have the potential to be amplified beyond anyone's control
in this case the backlash prompted miss lebanon <unk> greige to issue a statement distancing herself from the photo
many in the west dismissed the controversy as a <unk> matter
greige and miss israel doron matalon <unk> the controversy and went on to represent their countries in the pageant which aired sunday night on nbc
miss colombia <unk> <unk> won the crown
but pageant observers say the incident is a reminder that beauty pageants embody global politics with contestants expected to model the cultural sensibilities of their nations
they are cast with representing their country and as such they are expected to behave much like ambassadors said jessica <unk> <unk> an assistant professor with the school of international service at american university and the two thousand and seven miss earth pageant winner representing canada
the instagram controversy is the latest example showing that pageants occur in a broader international context <unk> <unk> said in a guardian column last week
russia came under fire as miss universe host country in two thousand and thirteen for not granting visas to contestants from countries it did not recognize including <unk> <unk> said
contestants threatened to boycott the two thousand and two miss world pageant scheduled in nigeria after a mother was sentenced to death for having sex outside marriage
organizers moved the pageant to london
with so many nations and so much politics planners must <unk> a delicate diplomatic dance said louise <unk> creator of pageant watch website <unk> dot com which shares information on international pageants and beauty queens
geopolitical affairs affect various aspects of pageant planning <unk> said
for example geographic neighbors russia and ukraine are traditionally assigned as <unk> but not this year
behind the scenes miss universe contestants tend to get along or at the very least are civil and <unk> <unk> said
after all each woman is representing her country on a global stage
for many it's the first time they ever leave their country
as people they genuinely like each other but they need to be <unk> that they are wearing a <unk> representing their country she said
obviously certain countries have inherent hostilities and i encourage contestants to talk to each other but i do not have them room together
it's easy for americans to brush aside the instagram controversy said maya berry executive director of the arab american institute in washington
but with regular cross border hostilities between israel and lebanon it's not surprising that the appearance of normalized relations between representatives of those countries might offend some in the region
politics enters into things like this unfortunately
it shouldn't be this way but when conditions are so bad and you have two countries at war with each other everything becomes political she said
if not for social media however the incident probably would not have made international headlines she said
that's what happens with social media
it's the tendency of a hashtag to be more meaningful than substance of what actually took place she said
it's significant burden to place on women in their twenty s
miss lebanon two thousand and two christina <unk> has experienced that burden firsthand
her country decided to skip the miss universe two thousand and two after israeli troops swept through a refugee camp in <unk> leading to allegations from palestinian officials of a massacre
a human rights watch report found evidence of possible war crimes but the group's investigators found no evidence that israeli troops massacred palestinian civilians
meanwhile <unk> <unk> <unk> israel's two thousand and two miss universe <unk> stoked controversy at the competition with a dress displaying the israeli state that included the disputed territories of west bank and gaza according to multiple news reports from the time
in an email to cnn on friday through her <unk> <unk> said she felt bad about missing the two thousand and two competition
but as a representative of her country she understood and respected the official decision
i think that beauty queens have a message of culture and peace to deliver and this is where real beauty is she said
but unfortunately we live in a world full of atrocities wars injustice and occupation and seen under that perspective a beauty queen has to understand and respect her country's laws and political positions
<unk> represented her country in other pageants
they were different settings but the expectations were the same

while it is easy to say forget politics it is just beauty it is just a pageant

if you recognize <unk> name it's probably not just for her long running role on medium
her sister is <unk> arquette
her brother is david arquette
her father lewis arquette was also an actor and her grandfather cliff arquette was well known as the <unk> comedian <unk> weaver
j.k. simmons a familiar face if not necessarily a familiar name won best supporting actor for his performance in <unk>

the pictures are what we're all waiting for alan stern new horizons principal investigator told cnn
up until now the best images of pluto have been a few <unk> shot by the hubble space telescope
the images released in two thousand and ten took four years and twenty computers operating continuously and simultaneously to produce according to marc <unk> of the southwest research institute in boulder colorado
they show what nasa called an icy and dark <unk> colored <unk> world that is undergoing seasonal changes in its surface color and brightness
that's not a very glamorous description but nasa said the images confirmed pluto is a dynamic world that undergoes dramatic atmospheric changes not simply a ball of ice and rock
new horizons is aiming its long range reconnaissance <unk> telescope at pluto to help navigate the final one hundred and thirty five million miles of its three billion mile journey
besides <unk> the space probe is packed with cameras and other instruments
by mid may we should get better than hubble photos
we'll also see pluto's five moons
<unk> nix hydra <unk> and <unk>
stern expects new optical navigation images to arrive any day now
i think of pluto as a kind of a christmas present that's been sitting under the tree waiting to be <unk> stern said
i just can't wait to see what's there
new horizons was launched on january nineteen two thousand and six
it will arrive at pluto on july fourteen two thousand and fifteen
the probe is twenty seven inches tall eighty three inches long and one hundred and eight inches wide
it weighed one thousand and fifty four pounds at launch
new horizons was launched before the big debate started over whether it's a planet
for the scientists on the new horizons team pluto is very much a planet just a new kind of planet
new horizons is on a journey to a new class of planets we've never seen in a place we've never been before says new horizons project scientist hal weaver of <unk>
for decades we thought pluto was this odd little body on the planetary outskirts
now we know it's really a gateway to an entire region of new worlds in the <unk> belt and new horizons is going to provide the first close up look at them
pluto is classified by nasa as a dwarf planet
it has five known moons
<unk> nix hydra <unk> and <unk>
pluto is about two thirds the diameter of earth's moon
it probably has a rocky core surrounded by ice
it's one of a group of objects that orbit beyond neptune in the <unk> belt
pluto is about twenty times as massive than ceres the dwarf planet between mars and jupiter that will be explored by the dawn spacecraft on march six two thousand and fifteen
pluto has a two hundred and forty eight year long elliptical orbit around the sun
from one thousand nine hundred and seventy nine to one thousand nine hundred and ninety nine pluto was actually closer to the sun than neptune
pluto was discovered in one thousand nine hundred and thirty by <unk> <unk> at the <unk> observatory in <unk> arizona
it was named by eleven year old <unk> <unk> of oxford england
the pair have chemistry according to the white house and indian officials
they've shared impromptu <unk> on the national mall and on sunday a long <unk> through a new delhi rose garden
indian weavers are <unk> <unk> together <unk> as gifts for the first lady
the normally congested indian capital has been rid of its stray monkeys at least in the places obama might visit
and local television networks are running entire pieces speculating the two leaders might take a selfie
here's a highlight <unk> of social media's favorite obama and modi <unk> so far
in case anyone doubted the deep bond between obama and modi air force one's arrival on sunday put any questions to rest
breaking with established protocol and surprising television commentators on the dozen or so local news broadcasters modi showed up on the tarmac to be the first to greet obama in india
and it wasn't just with a handshake
modi pulled the travel weary commander in chief for the bear hug seen around the world though like most unplanned hugs in front of a billion viewer television audience it was a little awkward
the two leaders later followed it up with another warm embrace after a joint press conference stoking rumors of a bromance
when modi visited obama at the white house in september the visit ended with obama blowing up his set in stone schedule and taking the visiting prime minister for a stroll at the martin luther king memorial on the national mall
the <unk> continued in new delhi
obama and modi <unk> their bilateral talks <unk> side by side through the formal gardens at <unk> house a stately one thousand nine hundred and twenty s home that now acts as a <unk> venue
cameras caught them <unk> away to each other but reporters could not hear what they said
after the stroll they sat down for a cup of tea
modi's camp wasted no time posting a facebook album of highlights
when obama and modi last sat down for dinner at the white house in september only one of them actually ate
modi was midway through a religious fast that allowed only warm water
this time around solid foods were consumed by all
a <unk> of lunch showed vegetarian and <unk> menus each with more than a dozen dishes
dinner was an even bigger affair
held at the presidential palace the event featured indian dancers a receiving line and of course a pair of heartfelt <unk>
india and the u.s. share the natural sense of <unk> their leaders enjoy modi said
obama went with a passage from <unk> <unk> passage to india
the earth to be <unk> connected by network the people to become brothers and sisters
here in our time these words have come to pass obama said
the leaders poked fun at each other throughout the day
during a press conference obama remarked that modi was greeted like a <unk> star when he visited new york's madison square garden last year
obama also said they compared how much sleep they're getting prompting polite laughter from the press corps
and it turns out that modi is getting even less sleep than me
but of course that's because he's still new
after you've been doing this for about six years maybe he'll be able to get an extra hour
not everyone was impressed with his answer however
and this is just the first day of obama's historic visit
stay tuned for highlights from day two which has a parade on the itinerary
obama's trip to my homeland

greece has become an <unk> crossroads both for jihadists trying to reach iraq and syria from europe and for fighters returning home from the middle east
greece's long land and maritime boundaries its proximity to turkey the explosion of illegal migration from syria and the country's dire financial situation make it an inviting hub for jihadist groups according to multiple counterterrorism sources
one source close to the greek intelligence services told cnn there may be some two hundred people in the country with links to jihadist groups such as the islamic state in iraq and syria or the al nusra front the two groups that most europeans join
leftist leader plans his next move after elections in greece
belgian officials believe that abdelhamid abaaoud a prominent belgian jihadist within isis may have traveled from syria to greece and then communicated by phone with the terrorist cell recently broken up by belgian police
earlier this month three young belgians were arrested at charleroi airport as they prepared to fly to greece
the belgian prosecutor's office says they have been charged with participation in a terror group
on january seventeen greek police arrested a thirty three year old algerian man whose extradition was sought by belgium in connection with last week's raids
the man who has not been named has protested his innocence
last year two french jihadists were arrested after using greek soil to return home
one was arrested after passing through italy
one was ibrahim boudina a twenty three year old french national born in <unk>
greek border guards had found in his possession a usb stick with instructions for how to make homemade bombs
they did not detain him but tipped off french investigators who later found bomb making equipment and devices in his apartment near cannes
boudina has denied terror charges and awaits trial
what's unknown is how many jihadists are traveling individually in either direction and how many are using support networks
greece is not a target just a gateway into europe and a stop on the fighters return home said the source close to greek intelligence
the large immigrant communities is greece and particularly in athens are in a position to provide jihadists and others associated with such groups with housing and generally help them remain anonymous the source said
in two thousand and eleven greek authorities detained nearly fifty thousand illegal migrants from afghanistan and pakistan according to police figures
one analyst who has studied jihadist travel patterns says there are indications that militants are setting up logistical recruitment and financial cells in greece in part to facilitate the travel of a growing number of would be fighters traveling from <unk> and <unk>
isis has produced several propaganda videos featuring <unk> appealing to their countrymen to join them and the <unk> authorities believe some two hundred individuals have left to wage jihad in iraq and syria
but it's not just the <unk> that's providing the travelers
we estimate that about two thousand people have used greece in the last two years or so mainly arriving by boat from italy as a stop to an <unk> journey the source close to the intelligence services told cnn
given the number of people who have left europe for syria and the middle east we don't regard this number as very high
but there is a good chance that it is much greater than we know at this point he added
coming in the other direction the number of migrants trying to reach europe illegally has soared since syria's <unk> especially by sea
many head to greece and italy on rust <unk> that <unk> the turkish coast seeking out the desperate
john m. nomikos director of the research institute for european and american studies in athens says many migrants have their documents taken by human traffickers and then seek political asylum when they get to greece
nomikos says a few of those who arrive in greece subsequently marry greek women and receive greek id cards or passports allowing them to travel through much of the european union
figures from the european union's border agency frontex show that two hundred and seventy thousand people tried to enter europe illegally in two thousand and fourteen with huge increases in the numbers setting off across the central and eastern mediterranean
whether isis or other groups are already exploiting this influx to infiltrate members into europe is one of the worrying <unk> to european officials
the greek interior ministry acknowledges it has little idea of the number of people living illegally in greece
nomikos and others say the greek authorities ability to track asylum seekers and would be jihadists has been hard hit by six years of recession a time in which budgets have been cut and senior members of the intelligence communities have lost their jobs or retired early
combined with political appointments in the security services and a lack of terrorism specialists nomikos says this has led to a damaging expertise deficit at a time when threats are <unk>
it doesn't help that greek police are <unk> with the remnants of the far left november seventeen group that occasionally launches sabotage attacks and carries out assassinations
nomikos also says there is inadequate coordination between the national intelligence service the police and other agencies and that greece badly needs help from the u.s. or european government to reform its security services
the country urgently needs a department of homeland security in order to coordinate the intelligence sharing among the greek intelligence service anti terrorism squad intelligence unit as well as police <unk> and military intelligence nomikos says
the balkan states to the north of greece have become a major source of weapons to jihadist cells elsewhere in europe and some analysts believe that militant groups in the middle east may also be tapping into this illicit arms <unk>
in november <unk> police arrested eight people in the town of <unk> and seized guns and ammunition
prosecutors were quoted in <unk> media as saying the weapons were destined for syria or iraq
in the wake of the paris attacks this month <unk> <unk> the european union's foreign policy chief promised better intelligence sharing across the eu and with affected arab states to tackle terrorism
an eu summit on february twelve will address the issue to be followed by a similar gathering in washington the following week
whatever the syriza government's disagreements with its partners on economic policy it will likely welcome a more coordinated approach on a danger it is unable to confront alone

blatter who is seeking a fifth term at the helm of world football's governing body told cnn in an exclusive interview that he still had unfinished business and would not step aside without a fight
i have to say i have not finished my mission because it's a mission to be in football
we have started in two thousand and eleven with the reform process
the reform process is not over
i would like to have these four years to finish it and to show that football is more than a game
but fifa has been mired in controversy since its decision to award the two thousand and eighteen and two thousand and twenty two world cups to russia and qatar
criticism reached a fever pitch when the man hired to investigate the bidding process for those world cups u.s. lawyer michael garcia resigned in protest last year unhappy that the published summary did not accurately reflect his findings
blatter has faced calls to stand down and although uefa is yet to declare its official position he clearly believes they are campaigning behind the scenes to <unk> him
they want to get rid of me he told cnn
all this opposition is coming now it's unfortunate to say it it's coming from <unk> from uefa
they don't have the courage to come in
so let me go be respectful
because in football you learn to win but you also learn to lose
so i'm going now
if i win the better if i lose ok
a uefa spokesman told cnn sunday that they had no immediate comment to make over blatter's remarks
three candidates have so far stated their intention to challenge blatter
frenchman jerome champagne prince ali bin al hussein of jordan and former star footballer david ginola
all must get the backing of at least five of the two hundred and nine member associations of fifa by a deadline of january twenty nine th to get on the ballot paper for the election on may twenty nine
blatter appears <unk> by his likely opponents with or without another candidate throwing their hat into the ring at this late stage
i have been asked by the national associations to be our candidate again because nobody that is strong was in
so i go there he said
he also appears to be <unk> the fight ahead despite closing on his seventy nine th birthday in march
i'm now forty years in fifa
i've been the president since one thousand nine hundred and ninety eight
you know it is impossible to make everybody happy
if i would have only positive press then it would not be good
and i like criticism as long as the criticism is
i would say fair criticism
i like the discussion to go with that
but listen i've been there such a long time now and i just want to finish that he added
but perhaps at odds with his other comments blatter also called for unity in football effectively inviting uefa to put up or shut up
football is a team sport
let's go together with the team
i invite the confederation of uefa and especially the leaders of uefa that are so <unk> attacking me
join
join
football is a unity
and we need this unity in this world
and if he can not find the necessary level of support and extend his tenure as the most powerful in world football blatter came up with a surprising choice of new career
the day i'm going to retire the first thing i'm going to do is radio
i always said i will do radio
because radio is even more popular than television than all electronics
i said one day this was my boy's wish to be a radio reporter one day
i don't know but i'm not so bad
the first indication of whether blatter will be seeking out new horizons may well come on february seven th or eight th the date he revealed to cnn when fifa will make public the full list of qualified candidates for the election
anyway i'm in and i don't mind
it's not my first battle for the presidency
i still have the conviction and i believe in myself and i believe in football the swiss said
nudity is the most simple and <unk> gesture it packs a punch <unk> said of his decision to have his models bare all
it's powerful
who else can really get away with this stuff
it's a corporate world
the looks were simply for shock and awe and the attention such reactions generate after all they can't be worn out in public and won't be sold in stores
but let's be honest
were we even shocked
after all female models have been asked to <unk> down <unk> in states of near <unk> for years
meanwhile more and more films are featuring full frontal male nudity
there was michael <unk> in shame of course
and who can forget the uproar over the <unk> of ben <unk> <unk> in gone girl albeit so brief one had to know the precise moment to look for it
and if we've seen ben <unk> <unk> who cares about some male <unk>
of course women have been going full frontal in films for years
perhaps the onslaught of <unk> is a sign that public nudity is becoming an equal opportunity endeavor
that women are no longer required to do all the showing
that's not a bad thing
maybe the free the <unk> people are finally getting their way and women will be able to parade topless around town or at the gym or wherever they please without stares or stigma as men have done for ages
more likely it's a clear sign that we're a culture so <unk> that we've got no other choice but to up the stakes at every turn
we are becoming have become immune to that which was previously surprising <unk> awe inspiring
it's amazing how quickly lady gaga went from <unk> to <unk> isn't it
meanwhile madonna is a faint middle aged voice from the past who in a time long ago made news with <unk> <unk> positively <unk> compared to the <unk> of today
consider their norms
going <unk> that's without underwear because yes there's even a phrase for it
giving birth on tv
posing naked for mainstream magazines
the kardashian sisters spent the fall one <unk> each other first kim's naked backside on the cover of paper and then <unk> naked pregnant belly online at <unk> because if one reality sister does it so too must the other
miley cyrus meanwhile continues to one up herself graduating from foam fingers and <unk> gestures to her recent full frontal magazine spread in v magazine the release of which she celebrated with a crude <unk> on social media
but what's next
what does she or any of these women do for an <unk>
where does a <unk> culture go from here for kicks
the envelope has already been pushed beyond what we once thought were the limits
what is left
perhaps they'll think of something
you just know those most shocking shows are trying to figure out how to show somebody actually die
you know that some <unk> on the verge will go beyond a private sex tape to arrange to be caught in the act
or maybe we'll grow up and become more european in our sensibilities and react less like middle school boys at the sight of a breast
maybe we'll learn that hitting bottom culturally reveals a whole new bottom underneath
whatever the impetus the bottom is in sight
after all being outrageous today is hard work and only getting harder
the <unk> meanwhile has nowhere to go but down

the mayor of <unk> connecticut mark <unk> recently made the news for creating the popular twitter hashtag <unk> when a major storm hit his area
it's an image that spread rapidly on social media and fueled furor among activists in egypt who claimed it cast light on a devastating reality four years after protests shaped a revolution that toppled egypt's government
activists say the woman <unk> el <unk> was peacefully participating in a small protest commemorating the revolution in <unk> tahrir square on saturday when she was shot dead
police deny using anything but tear gas as they <unk> protests
but el <unk> colleagues at the socialist popular alliance party say police fired shots and killed her
if there were any attempts to hold security officers accountable over the past four years <unk> wouldn't have been killed said khaled <unk> a spokesman for the constitution party
el <unk> was one of at least sixteen people killed in protests over the weekend at events marking the fourth anniversary of egypt's revolution officials say
fifteen were killed sunday including a police <unk> according to the ministry of health
two of those killed were men trying to plant a bomb in <unk> province ministry spokesman <unk> abdel ghaffar said
it was not clear sunday night how many people had been arrested because some were released on the spot or shortly afterward the interior ministry said
eight journalists covering the sunday protests were among those detained the association for freedom of thought and expression reported
meanwhile the prosecutor general has launched an investigation into el <unk> death and called policemen on duty that day in for questioning along with six socialist popular alliance party members arrested at the saturday march
<unk> el <unk> spokesman for the party called el <unk> death an assassination that sends a message against political and partisan life
four years ago on police day a national holiday celebrated january twenty five thousands of <unk> marched to protest security violations
the protests quickly gained momentum as clashes with security forces left hundreds dead and culminated in the ouster of then president hosni mubarak
almost all the police officers implicated in the two thousand and eleven violence were acquitted
last november a cairo court dismissed charges against mubarak and acquitted his interior minister and top security aides on charges related to the protesters deaths
thousands have been killed and thousands more arrested since two thousand and eleven as local and international rights groups decried the impunity with which security forces operated
the toll dramatically increased in the summer of two thousand and thirteen following the removal of ex president mohamed morsy in the wake of another wave of mass protests

the anti coup alliance which was launched to support morsy but has witnessed the departures of islamist parties and movements seeking different strategies posted photos and videos of marches and clashes with the police in and outside cairo
for <unk> hamed a forty seven year old member of the leftist bread and liberty party this <unk> on political life is the <unk>
it was the killing of april six <unk> <unk> <unk> during the demonstrations last january twenty five that convinced hamed to reconsider his belief that revolutionaries shouldn't <unk> the regime by political participation
i'm not ready to see another kid shot
i had to think about changing the mechanism of the revolution
demonstrations and protests had to be changed to protect the youth of the revolution so that no one else is shot dead
enough with blood he told cnn
hamed and fellow party members have an enduring goal
maintaining a place on the political scene until emerging parties are strong enough to mount a serious challenge
electoral campaigning would provide a state sanctioned framework to reach out to people network and organize in a bid to achieve the goals that fueled the revolution he explained
days before the anniversary hamed was in <unk> <unk> city neighborhood telling potential voters about a revolution that hoped to make authorities accountable
the revolution didn't give us anything a man told him
others voiced numerous concerns about security health care unemployment and housing
they had little hope that hamed or any elected official would bring about change
the fourth anniversary represents to all of us a new flame of hope development and action he said
there is no doubt that there are shortcomings that exist and will take time until we all overcome them
with the will to work and the will to change we will be able to overcome these shortcomings and achieve our hopes
finance minister <unk> <unk> told cnn late last year that the government is working on multiple fronts
battling inflation increasing spending on education and health care increasing the minimum wage and backing a new smart card system to deliver subsidies more efficiently
so we are dealing with this while the most important thing is to rebuild confidence in the egyptian economy to attract investors again and because we believe very much that having a job is your first line of protection against poverty and hardship he said
in addition to a <unk> developing the <unk> canal egypt is planning an international investment conference in march
in the densely populated low income <unk> city hamed echoed the <unk> so popular during the revolution
bread freedom and social justice
when there is bread and freedom social justice and human dignity will be achieved
for people it begins with bread
the debate on how to achieve these goals is still going on with the voices that oppose <unk> elections gaining momentum after el <unk> death
we can't imagine that elections supervised by the interior ministry presided over by the minister killing our youth can be fair elections bread and liberty spokesman <unk> <unk> said at a joint press conference on sunday
political parties that claim to battle for democracy social justice and a civilian system should take a unified stance constitution party head <unk> <unk> said at the press conference
a monday meeting will decide whether that means withdrawing from elections
despite the setbacks hamed was hopeful
the revolution didn't fail
the revolution is on the path typically taken by all revolutions in the world
revolutions don't happen and succeed in three to four years
the revolution is <unk> he said and we won't see results before ten or fifteen years at least
yet there i was alone with the stunning miss ghana two thousand and fourteen as we <unk> each other's outfits head to toe
<unk> <unk> <unk> who will battle for the planet's most prestigious <unk> this weekend at the sixty three rd annual miss universe pageant was wearing a form fitting ivory mini dress with black leather go go boots
i was wearing a <unk> purple <unk> v neck dress with neon yellow <unk>
i like your dress she said without the slightest trace of irony
pretending to be used to such <unk> i replied right back at ya
before awkwardly turning the conversation to ghana's geography of which i knew nothing
the runway we shared last fall was one mile of pavement along the hudson river in <unk> new jersey
we were fellow participants in the runaway <unk> charity race for airline ambassadors international an organization that trains airport employees to spot and report human trafficking
dozens of women and men <unk> in formal gowns and party dresses for the fundraiser prompting ms. <unk> to switch out her high <unk> boots for sneakers
before the race as miss ghana's <unk> snapped pics of us with her mobile phone i imagined what she might be texting her friends and family back home
dear mom and dad
if this <unk> in the purple dress is a preview of my competition this pageant will be a breeze
her real instagram feed was much kinder praising me and another male <unk> for our courage
for the same reasons i love the it's a small world ride at disney i always look forward to watching the miss universe contest
it's a <unk> <unk> universe where countries are supposed to set aside their petty <unk> and <unk> and pretend to be <unk>
critics can dismiss it as a <unk> hybrid of the united nations and the sports illustrated <unk> issue
but for the three hours the contestants stand on stage it doesn't matter how big their country's army is the size of the nation's gross national product or whether it has nuclear weapons
it's fascinating to see if that <unk> can even last three hours
this week miss lebanon <unk> greige <unk> a pr crisis at home for posing in a selfie taken by miss israel doron matalon along with miss slovenia and miss japan
it is against lebanese law to make contact with israelis
although she is smiling in the picture miss lebanon accused miss israel of <unk> her and it's understandable why she's running scared
in one thousand nine hundred and ninety three miss lebanon <unk> <unk> was stripped of her title when she posed with the then miss israel
the miss universe facebook page is filled with fun spirited group pics like this
random contestants <unk> on the beach <unk> on the golf course hugging local children and taking <unk> dance classes
i kid you not miss italy and miss turkey even had a <unk> <unk> party wearing matching socks
what will happen if miss israel and miss lebanon both make the top five on sunday night
how about miss russia and miss ukraine
will contestants from any of the former soviet bloc countries miss poland miss hungary miss czech republic give miss russia the <unk> eye
just like the olympic opening ceremony the miss universe pageant encourages people to <unk> be <unk> and see each other as individuals versus national or ethnic stereotypes
not that any of the millions of viewers around the globe will be asking for a geography lesson but the competition also forces people to wonder
so where exactly is <unk> and <unk>
and how cool is it to have an <unk> in your country's name
back to my personal competition with miss ghana i surprised myself by crossing the finish line a few minutes ahead of her
for unknown reasons she chose to walk through the race course and <unk> acted as if winning were <unk>
however ms. <unk> could <unk> defeat me in a <unk> contest
according to her official miss universe bio miss ghana can <unk> more than fifty times in a row
all those curves must do wonders for the <unk>
i'll definitely be rooting for her to win it all
how could i not
she liked my dress
the militants launched a simultaneous attack on the town of monguno and were apparently successful in taking control of the town and its military barracks a nigerian military officer in maiduguri told cnn
our soldiers initially repelled the terrorists but they mobilized more fighters and came back in full force
they overwhelmed our troops and forced them to retreat said the officer who asked not to be named because he was not authorized to speak to the media
monguno a town of about one hundred thousand people in northeast nigeria is about a one hundred and thirty five kilometer drive from maiduguri a city of more than six hundred thousand

<unk> <unk> a monguno resident who fled to maiduguri said several trucks carrying soldiers drove into maiduguri
we learned the town has been taken over by boko haram
monguno with its huge military barracks has a strategic importance in that it acts as a buffer to keep boko haram from advancing towards maiduguri
its fall means boko haram is in good position to advance on maiduguri which has been its goal for months
boko haram had been confined to the fishing town of baga since its fighters seized it january three hesitant to move south towards maiduguri because of the military presence in monguno
the islamists attacked the nearby village of jintilo around five a.m. and were engaged in a gunbattle with troops stationed there
the village is about five kilometers from the center of maiduguri the capital of borno state
speaking to reporters sunday afternoon borno governor <unk> shettima said so long as we have the resources we will continue to regard the efforts to reclaim peace our no
one area of commitments
i want to reassure the good people of borno state that we will never <unk> from our responsibility as those they entrusted with leadership
he further said he had canceled all engagements outside of borno and intends to remain behind with our people through thick and thin and after meeting with other past and present leaders in northern nigeria pressures are being combined and <unk> to the right authorities to ensure that the insurgency problems are brought to an end as quickly as possible
shettima closed by asking the people of borno to remain optimistic and vigilant and urged residents to keep close watch over their children and report any strange person and movement to authorities
the islamists attacked the nearby village of jintilo around five a.m. and were engaged in a gunbattle with troops stationed there
the village is about five kilometers from the center of maiduguri the capital of borno state
the fighting in jintilo forced residents to evacuate their homes and flee into the city while military authorities imposed a round the clock curfew to prevent infiltration by the militants
all the residents of neighborhoods near jintilo have fled into the city due to the ongoing battle between troops and boko haram gunmen who want to enter the city said <unk> <unk> who lives nearby
boko haram gunmen in their hundreds attacked jintilo around five a.m. just before the morning prayers but soldiers stationed there fought back <unk> said
since five a.m. all we hear are cracking of guns and booming explosions coming from the direction of jintilo said <unk> said a resident of another neighborhood near the scene of the fighting
there have been radio announcements of indefinite curfew in the city and we have all been asked to remain indoors said adam <unk> who lives in the heart of the city
hundreds of troop <unk> deployed in jintilo and military jets carried out aerial <unk> of boko haram positions said a member of a civilian vigilante group fighting boko haram alongside troops
the gunmen have been dealt with and are now on the run but they are being pursued by soldiers and vigilantes with the aerial support of a military jet said the vigilante who asked not to be named because he was not authorized to speak on the incident
the attack came a day after president goodluck jonathan made a campaign stop in maiduguri ahead of the february fourteen presidential election
he has promised to end the boko haram insurgency if re elected
on friday boko haram attacked <unk> village five kilometers from maiduguri killing fifteen people and burning homes in what was seen as a <unk> to a possible onslaught on the city
also friday boko haram released one hundred and ninety two hostages mostly women who had been kidnapped from a village in yobe state following a deadly raid according to community leaders a local politician and a military source
the hostages had been held in two boko haram enclaves since a january six raid on the village of katarko twenty kilometers from the state capital damaturu in which two hundred and eighteen women and children were abducted according to sources
boko haram have returned to us our one hundred and ninety two women they took away at the beginning of this month

they are still holding twenty six young boys they abducted along with the released hostages in katarko said the politician who asked not to be named for security reasons
a military officer confirmed the release of the hostages by boko haram
on january six dozens of boko haram gunmen stormed katarko where they killed twenty five men and threw the bodies in open wells burned the entire village and kidnapped the women and children according to <unk> and local vigilantes
the attack was apparently in <unk> for a raid on a boko haram <unk> by local hunters and vigilantes in <unk> <unk> twenty kilometers away hours earlier
several boko haram fighters were killed in that raid
scores of others were arrested and an arsenal was seized according to vigilantes
but for many on the streets of athens it's his words that matter his promise of no more bailouts no more submission no more <unk>
it's a message of hope that resonates with those across this country hardened by years of the <unk> bitter medicine
austerity
read
greeks vote in election that could lead to showdown over bailout
greece was among the nations hardest hit by the global financial crisis
a deeply troubled economy widespread unemployment and civil unrest meant that back in two thousand and ten the country was <unk> on the brink of exit from the euro labeled the sick man of europe
but the prescription handed down by the troika the international monetary fund european commission and european central bank was always going to be difficult to swallow
tax hikes a freeze on state pensions bans on early retirement and deep cuts in government salaries in return for a two hundred and forty billion bailout
five years on and the greek economy is starting to recover
last year it came out of recession
this year the country's gdp is expected to grow zero point seven percents
but some fear the years spent locked in a <unk> of debt and <unk> may have done more harm than good
there is widespread unemployment with twenty seven percents of the population out of work industrial production has shrunk thirty percents and three million people live on or below the poverty line
for many here austerity has only led to hardship and caused unbearable strains that are visible on faces across the city
over instant coffee at his house on the outskirts of athens nikos fifty eight says his world has been turned upside down since losing his job in two thousand and nine
he has been unemployed ever since
i used to have money in my pocket and now i have nothing he explains
i was supposed to get my pension next year and now that has been pushed back by two years
just put yourself in my position
the initial frustration he felt has turned to anger
his pride has also been battered
to get by he has had to ask his mother to share her pension not easy for a man who had always been the <unk>
now he and his four grown up sons depend on his wife <unk>
but her wages which have been slashed by fifty five percents are not enough to feed everyone leaving her with a tough decision
help the family or pay taxes
who to help first
they are four
i don't buy anything for myself so that i can help them
i had to pay two hundred and sixty in taxes and i only earn eight hundred
so i haven't paid the taxes and gave the money to my son to help him with his rent she explains
the family's desperation has only been exacerbated by their <unk> with politicians and their policies
since two thousand and five greece has had six prime ministers each one vowing to bring an end to the crisis
each one promising jobs and growth
but nothing nikos says has changed
so he and his wife are gambling on greece's left wing syriza party their pledge to bring an end to austerity and their message that hope is coming
angry and frustrated nikos insists
things can't get any worse with a new government
and if they do we'll vote again for someone else
have politicians ever asked an unemployed citizen when he wakes up in the morning and who has a family if this person has a single euro or five in his pocket to buy a <unk> of milk to feed his children
he asks
i don't trust any of them
for now nikos and <unk> are placing their trust in syriza and its leader alexis tsipras who has promised to raise the minimum wage re hire public sector workers reduce taxes and tackle the country's silent humanitarian crisis
but <unk> <unk> pledge and the one that is making the rest of europe nervous is his promise to renegotiate the terms of the greek bailout deal
at syriza's last rally before sunday's general election i asked the party's finance spokesman george <unk> what they will do if they can't see eye to eye with europe
what we are arguing for with our european partners is a new arrangement that will remove part of the public debt burden on the greek economy and at the same time allow greece to get back to work he says
in other words they want to stay in the single currency but with more fiscal <unk> a breathing space of sorts so the country can recover from its economic coma and begin to grow again
both working class and middle class voters and both public and private sector workers have voiced support for this call
computer developer <unk> <unk> says he has always voted for the conservatives but having seen his wages slashed and his taxes increase and as the father of a newborn baby he's voting for change this time around
syriza doesn't express one hundred percents my opinions and i'm not level with what they believe and what they want to do but i believe its something new a new party with fresh ideas that is going to change what is already rotten he explains
there is no doubt that anger and austerity have fueled the rise of syriza in a country whose citizens are calling for social and economic change
but if he is elected the question of whether tsipras can make a difference to greece will depend on what he does with his power and how the eu and its leaders deal with him
whatever the outcome of sunday's polls the hard work it seems is just beginning
the administration's policy in the increasingly unstable country has come under scrutiny in recent days as the u.s. backed government crumbled under pressure from shiite houthi rebels
yemen has never been a perfect democracy or a island of stability obama said in new delhi where he's on a three day state visit
he described the u.s. policy there partnering and intelligence sharing with that local government as the best approach in a bad situation
the alternative would be for us to play whack a <unk> every time there is a terrorist actor inside of any given country obama said
the unraveling security situation in yemen the same country obama cited as a model for his fight against isis terrorists has thrown the president's <unk> message into question
in the capital sanaa last week the presidential palace was overrun by houthi rebels and president abdu rabu mansour hadi announced he was resigning
that's a problem for the united states which has relied on the government in yemen as an ally in battling the al qaeda affiliate that's based there
a power vacuum could benefit al qaeda in the arabian peninsula the terrorist offshoot that u.s. officials consider the most dangerous branch of the global jihadi network
amid the uncertainty in yemen last week it was reported the u.s. had suspended its <unk> efforts there
obama said definitively on sunday those reports were wrong
we continue to go after high value targets inside yemen he said
obama himself cited the u.s. yemen partnership when he announced in september he was going after isis terrorists in iraq and syria
explaining why he was ruling out sending american troops to fight isis obama said he was modeling his strategy after what he said were successful efforts in yemen and somalia to partner with governments to go after terrorists
this strategy of taking out terrorists who threaten us while supporting partners on the front lines is one that we have successfully pursued in yemen and somalia for years obama said on september ten
it is consistent with the approach i outlined earlier this year
to use force against anyone who threatens america's core interests but to mobilize partners wherever possible to address broader challenges to international order
what that strategy relied on however was a strong partnership between the united states and the existing government in yemen led by hadi
hadi reorganized yemen's military to better go after aqap a strategy that worked for a time
but the plan was <unk> when resources were diverted to battle the militant houthis a group of shiites who say they feel marginalized in the majority sunni country
obama was confident on sunday that u.s. anti terror efforts would continue in yemen
what we have shown is that we can maintain the kind of pressure on these terrorist networks even in these kind of difficult environments he said
we have no interest in seeing russia weakened or its economy in shambles
we have a profound interest as i believe every country does in promoting a core principle which is
large countries don't bully smaller countries obama told reporters
speaking in new delhi after a lengthy flight on air force one obama said sunday he will look at all the additional options that are available to us short of military confrontation
on monday obama will be the first u.s. leader to headline india's annual republic day parade a colorful military spectacle featuring marching bands dancing and lots of heavy machinery rolling down the stately rajpath boulevard
the parade will be a reminder of the decades of sometimes tense relations between india and the u.s. a military demonstration at heart the vehicles and equipment <unk> before obama will be mostly russian made a <unk> of india's stance during the cold war
russia remains india's largest supplier of weapons and while their share is steadily decreasing russian military imports still amount to three quarters of india's stockpile
with u.s. russia relations worsening to cold war levels obama hopes to balance moscow's influence in india during his visit this week
his visit comes a day after city officials in mariupol ukraine said shelling in southeastern ukraine killed at least thirty people including two children
another one hundred and two people were injured at least seventy five of whom needed hospital treatment and many suffered shrapnel injuries mariupol city council said
pro russian separatists are blamed for the attack on residential areas in the port city donetsk regional police chief vyacheslav abroskin said on his facebook page
monitors with the organization for security and co operation in europe said they conducted a crater analysis which showed the use of grad and <unk> rockets that likely originated from areas controlled by the pro russian rebel group donetsk people's republic
the shelling comes amid a surge in fighting between government forces and pro russian separatists
u.s. secretary of state john kerry and russian foreign minister sergey lavrov discussed ukraine and syria during a phone call the state department said
on ukraine the secretary reiterated our condemnation of the separatists grad missile attack on civilians in mariupol
and other separatist attacks a statement said
the secretary reiterated the need for an immediate <unk> of the ceasefire a withdrawal of heavy weapons and closing the border
he also underscored u.s. readiness to participate in serious settlement efforts making clear that <unk> is in everyone's interests that russia will be judged by its actions and that the costs to russia will only increase if attacks continue
kerry has previously warned of increased international pressure on russia
we call on russia to end its support for separatists immediately close the international border with ukraine and withdraw all weapons fighters and financial backing kerry said in a statement saturday
the white house says vice president joe biden spoke with ukraine president petro poroshenko on saturday
they expressed grave concern over russia's blatant disregard for its commitments under the september minsk agreement and unilateral escalation of the conflict the white house said
thousands have been killed since the conflict broke out in the spring of last year
a ceasefire agreed to in september in minsk belarus crumbled long ago

she is dressed in a bathing suit smiling <unk> while performing a <unk> split
<unk> <unk> eger says the portrait was taken by her first teenage crush
a jewish boy named <unk>
he like so many others would not survive the holocaust
i had my seventeen th birthday in auschwitz eger says
seventy years later eger appears frail at first glance until she <unk> a new acquaintance by performing a dance kick that goes shoulder high
the eighty seven year old says her <unk> childhood memories still <unk> around dancing and training to compete for the hungarian olympic team as a <unk>
but then i was told that i had to train somewhere else because i'm jewish and i do not qualify for the olympics eger recalls
my dream was totally shattered
eger was a hungarian jew the youngest of three daughters living in a town called <unk> in what is modern day <unk>
her father was a tailor
her mother a civil servant
it wasn't until march one thousand nine hundred and forty four late in world war ii that eger says hungarian nazis came to her house and arrested her family
the jews in hungary were among the last of europe's jewish communities to be targeted by the nazis
the family was taken to other internment centers before they were finally loaded into a train and shipped to the auschwitz concentration camp in poland occupied by nazi germany
my mom held me in the cattle car eger recalls
and she said we don't know where we're going
we don't know what's going to happen
just remember no one can take away from you what you put here in your own mind
upon arrival at the camp eger said dr. joseph mengele one of the auschwitz <unk> top medical officers stood at the end of a line of prisoners deciding who would go to the gas chambers and who would head for the prison barracks
he pointed to my mom to go to the left and i followed my mom eger says
and dr. mengele grabbed me i never forget that eye contact and he said you're going to see you mother soon she's just going to take a shower
it was the last time eger saw her parents
they died in the gas chambers of auschwitz along with more than a million other jews
but that would not be the <unk> final encounter with the infamous ss doctor who later became known the angel of death
dr. mengele came to the barracks and wanted to be entertained eger says
fellow inmates volunteered eger to perform for the man who had ordered her parents death
she asked her captors to play the blue <unk> <unk> as she danced for one of the worst war criminals of the holocaust
i was so scared eger says
i closed my eyes and i pretended that the music was <unk> and i was dancing <unk> and <unk> in the budapest opera house
the german doctor rewarded the jewish girl with an extra <unk> of bread which she later shared with the girls in her prison quarters
eger says months later those same girls rescued her when she nearly collapsed from disease and starvation during a forced death march through austria
they formed a chair with their arms and they carried me so i wouldn't die she says adding isn't it important that the worst conditions really brought out the best in us
decades after the horrors of the holocaust dance is still a passion
<unk> house on a hill overlooking the pacific ocean is decorated with statues of <unk>
every sunday she says she goes swing dancing to the music that american soldiers introduced her to when they liberated her in austria in one thousand nine hundred and forty five
i want to have a full life not to be damaged goods she says
perhaps that defiant spirit helped the teenager survive the horrors of world war ii and later blossom as an <unk> in the united states
shortly after the war eger met and married a fellow hungarian jew who had been a partisan anti nazi fighter
the young family moved with their infant daughter to the united states to escape communist rule in hungary
she was very shy when i was growing up recalls <unk> eldest daughter <unk> who says her mother transformed in the one thousand nine hundred and seventy s after a visit to auschwitz
after that she changed dramatically the daughter says
there had always been a bit of sadness behind her eyes and afterwards it was gone
i think it did free her and she became who she is now
it was also in the one thousand nine hundred and seventy s that eger began studying psychology
decades later she still works as a clinical psychologist running a practice out of her home in la <unk>
her specialty involved treating patients suffering from post traumatic stress disorder
she evolved at a time as a psychologist when ptsd wasn't even on the map says dr. saul levine professor emeritus in psychiatry at the university of california at san diego who has known and worked with eger for more than twenty years
she is an expert by definition almost by having had that experience herself but also relating to it in a clinical way as well as in a deeply personal way levine said
throughout her career in psychology eger has done extensive consulting work with the u.s. military treating american veterans of wars in vietnam iraq and afghanistan
she has also helped set up shelters for female victims of domestic abuse
auschwitz gave me a tremendous gift in some ways that i can guide people to have resilience and perseverance eger says
in time eger also become a <unk> public speaker performing a ted talk and giving speeches at schools and universities
she <unk> her hungarian <unk> english with <unk> aimed at mental healing
self love is self care she tells patients
the biggest concentration camp is in our mind
she blew me away with her extraordinary optimism and energy levine says recalling the first time he saw eger speaking to an audience
she is a force of nature
seventy years after the liberation of auschwitz this holocaust <unk> greatest pride and joy are clearly her three great grandchildren
that's the best revenge to hitler i can think of says the dancer pointing at one of several portraits of her smiling great grandchildren in her office

with more than seventy percents of votes counted syriza was officially projected to win at least one hundred and forty nine seats in the three hundred seat parliament
exit polls also placed the party in the lead
but analysts cautioned that it was still too close to call whether syriza would win a majority of seats a key step that would allow the party to govern without forming a coalition government
tsipras forty who could become greece's next prime minister also vowed to end austerity measures
greece leaves behind the austerity that ruined it leaves behind the fear leaves behind five years of humiliation and greece moves forward with optimism and hope and dignity he told the crowd
syriza's pledges to try to get some of greece's colossal debt written off and roll back unpopular austerity measures appealed to exasperated members of the electorate even if they potentially jeopardize greece's place in the <unk>
the election could lead to a dramatic showdown with the debt laden nation's lenders
that is a gamble that people in greece seem to be prepared to take at this point simply because the terms of its bailout have been so severe greek journalist <unk> <unk> told cnn on sunday
one of those people willing to take the risk is <unk> <unk> a former public sector employee
people went bankrupt since we entered the bailout poverty is visible across society and i believe that hope is coming with syriza's program not only for greece but for all of europe she said ahead of the election
the austerity imposed by greece's international creditors has cut deep
unemployment has soared to twenty eight percents and many people who still have jobs have seen drastic decreases in wages pensions frozen and the retirement age pushed back
the governing new democracy party had pointed to recent improvements in economic indicators as signs things were getting better
after conceding defeat sunday outgoing prime minister <unk> samaras said his conscience was clear
i got a country on the verge of ruin
i was asked to try and save it and i did it he said
most people did not believe we could stand strong but we did
now he said greece is secure and slowly walking away from the crisis
and more than anything he said i give back a country that is a member of the european parliament and the euro
in his victory speech sunday tsipras noted that greece's election could have an impact far beyond his country's borders
our victory is at the same time it's a victory for all the people of europe that are fighting against austerity that's ruining the common european future he said
his message is one that has resonated in other southern european countries under the restrictions of international bailouts
syriza's victory could boost other populist parties like beppe grillo's anti euro five star movement in italy and the podemos movement in spain
but it's unclear how its plans to renegotiate the bailout would play out
is alexis tsipras man of the moment
a video file posted online saturday by a known isis supporter shows an image of one hostage kenji goto holding a photo of what appears to be the corpse of his fellow captive haruna yukawa
the voice of a person claiming to be goto speaks over the image saying in english that japanese prime minister shinzo abe is to blame for yukawa's death
you were given a deadline he says referring to isis earlier demand that japan pay two hundred million dollar by friday to save the lives of the two hostages
the voice then announces a new ultimatum
the release of sajida al rishawi an iraqi woman facing the death penalty in jordan for her role in a series of bombings in two thousand and five that killed dozens of people at hotels in the arab kingdom
al <unk> radio an isis affiliated online station reported the extremist group's killing of yukawa and the prisoner swap demand for goto in its <unk> sunday
it didn't identify goto by name
abe condemned the apparent killing of yukawa and called for goto to be released immediately
such act of terrorism is outrageous and <unk> which causes me nothing but strong indignation he said
experts are analyzing the video which seems highly credible abe said an assessment shared by u.s. authorities who said they had no reason to doubt its authenticity
but goto's stepfather <unk> ishido raised doubts about whether it was his <unk> voice in the video
i get the sense it's not his voice he told reporters
i've heard his english a couple times
i felt it was a bit different
abe declined to comment on how his government would respond to the new demand which doesn't appear to have a clear deadline
i would be surprised if the jordanian government or japan really pushed forward and released this female suicide bomber as isis has requested said cnn global affairs analyst david <unk> referring to al rishawi whose explosives failed to go off in the hotel attack in which she participated
after isis released the first video of the hostages tuesday japan set up a crisis center in jordan and said it was trying to communicate with the militant group through third parties such as governments in the region and tribal leaders
japanese officials declined to explicitly rule out paying a ransom but said they wouldn't yield to terrorism
they stressed that an aid package abe had pledged to countries affected by isis cited by the militant group as the reason for the huge ransom demand was only for humanitarian purposes
but the japanese efforts appear to have failed to save yukawa forty two whose father was struggling to come to terms with the news
i still don't want to believe it shoichi yukawa told japanese broadcaster nhk his face not shown in the report
if i can see him again i'd like to hold him in my arms
goto's mother junko ishido had made an emotional plea friday for the release of her son saying he isn't an enemy of isis
kenji always has been a kind person ever since he was little she said
he was always saying i want to save the lives of children in war zones
goto forty seven is an experienced freelance journalist who frequently reported from war zones
he met yukawa who had dreams of setting up a private security firm while they were both in syria last year according to friends
after yukawa was reported to have been captured in august goto apparently decided to leave his wife and two young daughters in japan to go into isis territory to try to <unk> him
i asked my son's wife why he had made this decision and the response was that my son felt he had to do everything in his power to help and rescue his friend ishido said
but rather than save yukawa goto ended up becoming another captive in the hands of a brutal militant group that has slaughtered countless iraqis and syrians as well as three americans and two <unk>
u.s. president barack obama spoke with abe by phone sunday from new delhi the white house said
obama offered condolences for the murder of yukawa by isis and conveyed solidarity with the japanese people according to a statement
obama had condemned the killing in an earlier statement saturday saying the united states will work with its ally to bring the perpetrators of these murders to justice and will continue to take decisive action to degrade and ultimately defeat isis
british prime minister david cameron said the apparent beheading of yukawa and isis threats are yet another reminder of the murderous barbarity of these terrorists
he suggested japan was right not to bow to the terrorists demand for ransom saying that britain strongly supports the firm stance prime minister abe and his government have taken
the united states and britain both refuse to pay ransoms to terrorists
but other countries notably france have reportedly spent tens of millions of dollars on the release of hostages held by islamic militants in recent years despite denying it publicly
japan has also paid kidnappers to free its citizens in the past according to the new york times
in one thousand nine hundred and ninety nine tokyo handed over three million dollar for the release of four mining experts held in <unk> the newspaper reported
the voters <unk> at me <unk> their decaying <unk> with the decaying economy all around them
they blamed trade deals especially the north american free trade agreement for the loss of good manufacturing jobs in the area and laws giving steel and auto plants the chance to move jobs overseas
one after another each voter reminded me that both parties supported the <unk> nafta deal that got us into this mess
how could we trust any of them to get us out
a decade later just after the twenty th anniversary of nafta president obama is marking the disastrous legacy of free trade policies by working with republicans to push for even more bad trade deals that would benefit big businesses at the expense of america's economy and workers
president obama has outlined an ambitious agenda to help the middle class
but his <unk> to find some area of compromise with republicans in the form of trade policy risks undermining all his other plans
i'm asking both parties to give me trade promotion authority to protect american workers with strong new trade deals from asia to europe that aren't just free but fair president obama said in his state of the union address on tuesday night as republicans stood and applauded while democrats rightly stayed in their seats
trade promotion authority is a new <unk> for fast track authority which would give the president authority to negotiate international trade agreements on his own
congress could veto such deals but could not amend or filibuster them
fast track trade authority removes important checks and balances not only in our legislative process but in our economy as a whole
this is a bad idea for two reasons
in recent history trade deals enacted by washington have been bad for american workers and our economy
president obama and republicans promote trade deals as good for economic growth and job creation
ninety five percent of the world's customers live outside our borders and we can't close ourselves off from those opportunities president obama said
however government data analyzed by the nonprofit public citizen shows that under two decades of fast track trade agreements u.s. trade deficits have gotten worse increasing by over four hundred and forty percents
nearly five million u.s. jobs one in four manufacturing jobs in america have been lost since fast track deals like nafta and related agreements
while president obama has emphasized that he wants to reduce income inequality numerous studies say such trade deals have contributed to the rise in income inequality
in fact wages in the united states have remained mostly stagnant adjusted for inflation since the mid one thousand nine hundred and seventy s when fast track trade authority was first enacted even though worker productivity has doubled in the same period
all of this suggests we need more scrutiny on these trade deals not less
given the evidence of the destruction of previous trade deals we need giant caution signs speed bumps and <unk> not a fast track
the other problem with fast track trade authority is that it allows our trade negotiators to unilaterally undermine <unk> passed legislation
for instance the trans pacific partnership an eleven nation deal championed by both president obama and top republicans in congress is not really about trade
of the <unk> twenty nine chapters only five address trade issues
the other chapters do things like create new monopoly patent <unk> for pharmaceutical companies that would raise medicine prices for average americans and create a right for foreign firms to import food to the u.s. exempt from our current food safety standards
the trans pacific partnership would even restrict certain buy local and buy american initiatives in other words preventing american consumers from protesting the trade deal with their own votes and wallets
i should add that this is what <unk> think is in the trans pacific partnership deal because of document leaks
we don't know for sure because while six hundred private corporations have been involved in negotiating the terms of the trade deal behind closed doors even congress won't get to see the terms of the deal until after it's signed
that's why many democrats oppose the deal and similarly disastrous trade deals like it
if more <unk> job killing trade bills are what comes from bipartisanship i would rather take more bitter <unk>

berdych will <unk> prove a dangerous opponent and showed his intentions with a straight sets victory over australian hope bernard <unk> in their last sixteen clash sunday but he has a three eighteen career record against nadal
the route to the final in that half of the draw has been eased by the upset exit of second seed roger federer to andreas seppi of italy friday
seppi looked set to build on those <unk> when he took a two set lead against the poster boy of the championships nineteen year old nick <unk> but the australian teenager was made of <unk> stuff
he fought back to level saving a match point in the fourth set and amid a mounting frenzy on the <unk> arena took the deciding set eight six after over three and a half hours of <unk> action

they are the kind of images many japanese hoped they would not have to deal with
after all japan is currently barred by its peace constitution from engaging in offensive military action
yet despite this isis has apparently decided that japan is an adversary
this is likely in part because japan is a close ally of the united states one that also has a strong interest in the stability of the middle east
moreover during his recent visit to israel jordan and egypt prime minister shinzo abe pledged two hundred million dollar in non military aid to nations dealing with isis
but whatever isis's intentions japan's non combat role in world affairs hasn't stopped it from being a victim of terrorism in the post september eleven era
in two thousand and three for example two diplomats were killed in a terrorist ambush in iraq and several citizens were taken hostage in iraq in two thousand and four and two thousand and five
in two thousand and twelve a veteran journalist was killed in syria while in january two thousand and thirteen nine japanese citizens were killed in the algerian hostage crisis
still this latest hostage crisis has been particularly attention grabbing for many japanese for two reasons
the first and most obvious is the fact that there was such vivid notice given the huge ransom demand with a seventy two hour ultimatum followed by the disturbing images saturday
but the hostage taking has also prompted an interesting debate over the story behind why journalist kenji goto and self styled military contractor haruna yukawa were in syria
the japanese public obviously hoped for the safe return of our two citizens but most did not believe the government should pay the ransom
and there was also particular sympathy for goto who is not only recognized for his journalism but who was apparently captured after going to the region to try to rescue yukawa
but there have also been questions about why nothing was done sooner when the two had been missing for months and also why they were in such a dangerous part of the world in the first place
many japanese believe the two bear some responsibility for traveling to the region despite public warnings by the japanese government about the risks of citizens traveling there
looking ahead the hostage taking has left many wondering what the impact will be on japan's current efforts to upgrade its security policies and processes
the crisis will be seen as <unk> the impact of instability thousands of miles from its shores and therefore the need for japan to adopt a sharper more proactive security posture even beyond east asia
more specifically one of the fifteen scenarios presented by the japanese government in its push toward a more proactive defense posture was allowing the use of weapons in overseas rescue missions of japanese citizens
the development of this specific scenario reflects the lessons of the two thousand and thirteen algeria crisis and the fact that under current laws only aircraft vehicles and vessels are allowed for transportation
if these changes are introduced the japanese government would be able to dispatch its japan self defense force for armed rescue operations
certainly given the security challenges that japan faces both within asia in the form of territorial issues with china and with an unpredictable north korea and further afield it seems essential that japan <unk> and strengthens its defense posture and plays a more proactive international role
to make this possible japan will have to do a number of things
first the government will have to learn how to better execute its crisis management efforts using new assets such as the recently formed national security council
second the government needs to get more creative in its efforts to enhance its international coordination and intelligence capabilities and ultimately defense assets to strengthen its security capacity
in addition japan needs to place greater priority on <unk> its forces to meet the evolving challenges it faces
and finally tokyo must focus more on promoting greater awareness of terrorist groups such as isis and the very real and direct threat they could pose to the country
achieving all this will be challenging and will require investing significant political and bureaucratic capital
and while prime minister abe's party has just won a resounding victory in a snap election japan is also dealing with an aging population and stagnant economy so it is unclear how much in terms of energy and resources the government will have to spend on <unk> the country's security posture
but as much as anything the debate over security and this week's tragic hostage situation are a reminder that japan may increasingly find itself and its citizens in the firing line
a more assertive policy will expose japan to more conflict and <unk> its exposure to terrorism no small shift to handle in a remarkably safe country that for decades has turned its back on military conflict
how the government deals with this challenge and more immediately the aftermath of this week's tragedy will shape the direction of japan's national security and its ability to protect this country's citizens
the previous bids to bring the piece of wreckage estimated to be at least ten meters long out of the water failed after lines being used to lift it broke according to indonesian authorities
on saturday sharp parts of debris sliced through a strap
on sunday a wire rope snapped after the fuselage had reached the surface of the water
the military divers were hoping to avoid similar problems monday by using twice as much rope as the day before said <unk> b. supriyadi director of operations and training for indonesia's search and rescue agency
they were also putting the inflatable bags being used to lift the wreckage inside the fuselage he said
but the deteriorating weather conditions halted the efforts supriyadi said later monday
officials are aiming to float the wreckage to the surface and then <unk> it onto a waiting ship
flight qz eight thousand five hundred and one went down on december twenty eight as it flew from the indonesian city of surabaya toward singapore with one hundred and sixty two people on board
indonesian officials have said they believe many of the remains of people still missing from the disaster may be inside the fuselage
supriyadi warned that the walls of the plane body are broken and move around easily making the divers task harder
they had successfully carried out a similar procedure with the tail section of the aircraft earlier this month
as the fuselage <unk> the surface on sunday one body appeared in the water and was retrieved authorities said
it's the seventy th recovered so far during weeks of searching
efforts by divers before the weekend to examine and get inside the fuselage as it lay on the seafloor were hindered by strong currents and bad visibility
bad weather repeatedly interrupted the work to try to lift the plane over the weekend
investigators are analyzing the contents of flight qz eight thousand five hundred and one's flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder as they try to establish why the airbus a three hundred and twenty two hundred went down in an area of heavy thunderstorms
experts have speculated from the outset that the storms might have played a role in the plane crash
the aircraft lost contact with air traffic control after the pilot asked permission to turn and climb to higher altitude because of bad weather officials have said
indonesia's transportation minister said tuesday that flight qz eight thousand five hundred and one climbed rapidly and then stalled shortly before it crashed
for large swaths of the northeast saturday arrived with a messy mix of <unk> snow and rain with parts of pennsylvania and new jersey receiving as much as eight inches of snow before the storm set its sights on new england
an estimated forty million people got their first real glimpse of winter
weather <unk> or warnings were in place from the <unk> of west virginia to maine
by saturday afternoon about twenty seven million people were still under a winter weather advisory or warning
coming on a weekend the <unk> weather will inconvenience many
but a major snowstorm on track to hit the northeast region monday night into tuesday could <unk> havoc during the <unk>
the nation's capital was under a winter weather advisory with snow expected in the western suburbs and brief snowfall downtown turning into a mix of rain and snow
in philadelphia a winter weather advisory was in effect with two to four inches of snow in the city but as much as eight inches farther west
the township of <unk> pennsylvania got nine inches of snow
the village of <unk> church received eight inches
crews from the pennsylvania department of transportation and other agencies spent two nights <unk> roads to avoid a repeat of last sunday when wet weather caused hundreds of accidents and parts of major highways and bridges were forced to close cnn affiliate <unk> reported
they've been out through the duration of this storm spokesman brad rudolph told the station
we have three hundred and thirty nine trucks in the five county region and they'll be out for the duration
the new york area also <unk> to a winter weather advisory with two to five inches of snow in the city followed by rain but a higher amount in interior new jersey the lower hudson valley and southern connecticut
<unk> and freezing rain were mixed in at times
new york gov
andrew cuomo urged drivers in the hudson valley new york city and long island to exercise caution
the state was dispatching some eight hundred and seventy plows and one thousand eight hundred operators from the transportation department throughout the region cuomo said in a statement
the port authority of new york and new jersey urged air and bus travelers to check with carriers before heading out
the authority which operates the three major airports in the area reported that it had more than two hundred pieces of snow equipment at airports including <unk> machines capable of <unk> five hundred tons of snow an hour and plows to clear snow at forty mph
in new england boston also was under winter weather warnings with snowfall expected to reach as much as seven inches
between six and twelve inches of snow could fall in parts of massachusetts up through maine
a wintry mix on the freezing line separating the rain and snow bands could make driving conditions <unk>
but that's not all
by sunday a strong storm system originating in alberta canada will have moved down to the upper midwest leaving between two and four inches of snow across minnesota and wisconsin before heading east
that will mean new snowfall is likely sunday night into monday in philadelphia and new york with the nation's capital getting a mix of rain and snow
the start of the work week could get ugly
the major storm on track to hit the northeast starting monday night could heap the heaviest snowfall from coastal new jersey and new york city to boston and coastal maine
blizzard conditions are possible in new england on tuesday with forecast models showing more than two feet of snow in boston and as much as a foot in new york
immigration and islamic extremism took front and center as the white house hopefuls sought to test drive their stump speeches
on style it was wisconsin gov
scott walker and texas sen. ted cruz who saw strong receptions from the audience though support for a wide number of candidates was expressed in the hallways after the event
new jersey gov
chris christie also sought to establish a deeper bond with iowa
the hawkeye state receives outsized attention in presidential years thanks to its first in the nation status during the primary season
for the ten hour day of back to back speeches the candidates as they were called joined other high profile republicans at hoyt sherman place an old intricate theater built in one thousand eight hundred and seventy seven that also became the first public art museum in des moines
billed as the iowa freedom summit the event was co hosted by citizens united and rep. steve king a revered lawmaker who represents the northwestern part of the state and has considerable clout among the more social conservative and christian right faction of the party
it was no secret that it was considered a cattle call for the presidential race
former arkansas gov
mike huckabee for example said that the reason he ended his fox news show was for a bigger goal he has in mind
it wasn't just so i can go deer hunting every weekend i can assure you that he said
others were more blatant
i am a potential presidential candidate yes i am former hewlett packard ceo carly fiorina told cnn
even palin <unk> to get in on some of the action teasing ahead of her appearance saturday that she was now seriously considering a run
and real estate titan donald trump told reporters saturday that he'll make his decision before june
i'm the one person who can make this country great again that's all i know he told reporters saturday
nobody else can
palin in her remarks was less forward
ticking through a somewhat dizzying and hard to follow speech palin suggested that the country is ready for a woman leader just not hillary clinton
hey iowa can anyone stop hillary
she said prompting the audience to cheer
to borrow a phrase yes we can
the speakers who were typically allotted twenty minutes used a bulk of their speeches to share their own personal <unk>
ben carson and christie talked about their strict but sharp mothers while wisconsin gov
scott walker and texas sen. ted cruz talked about having <unk> as fathers
other more well known names in iowa like former pennsylvania sen. rick santorum who won the state's caucuses in two thousand and twelve and huckabee who won in two thousand and eight tried to remind iowans why they picked them in the first place dipping into their personalities but also focusing on the issues
given king's firebrand credentials as an outspoken opponent of illegal immigration it was no surprise that problems at the border became a focal point in much of the speeches saturday
carson a retired neurosurgeon argued there wouldn't be people coming in here if there wasn't a magnet pulling them in suggesting there should be criminal punishment for employers who hire undocumented workers
the main target in the immigration battle however was president barack obama's executive action to delay deportation for up to five million undocumented immigrants
or as palin put it in her <unk> swagger obama's decision makes him seem like an <unk> little boy who's just acting kinda spoiled
speakers railed against the president's pledge to use his pen and his phone to work around congress with immigration as just one example of what many called the president's overreach
that was punctuated when dream act coalition protesters interrupted rick perry's speech leading to one arrest and theater full of iowans trying to drown out the demonstrators chants
the potential candidates also warned about what they see as a dire path for the country in particular when it comes to foreign policy a theme that along with immigration also seems poised to become a flash point in the two thousand and sixteen presidential race unlike in two thousand and twelve
santorum argued that the growth of isis is a consequence of the <unk> and weakness from the obama's administration
cruz like several speakers said the president will fail in the war on terror if he refuses to use the words radical islamic terrorism
huckabee blasted obama for devoting more time to climate change in the state of the union address than talking about terrorism
a beheading is a far greater threat to americans than a sunburn huckabee said
there was plenty of the usual iowa charm on stage speeches with pig <unk> and corn references
and there was more than one reference to how people in iowa are somehow taller than average
shown on a big screen above the stage was an image of a red barn sitting on a green hill surrounded by white fences
steve king's name in all caps was plastered across banners on the stage as well as the podium
the contenders also <unk> out a <unk> of red meat blasting obamacare common core the media hillary clinton and the eighteen dollar trillion debt
cruz won huge applause for proposing to place one hundred and ten thousand irs employees on the southern border joking that they'll do a better job at <unk> illegal immigration than anything else
giving a shout out to the state's newly elected u.s. senator joni ernst was also a popular item on the agenda for the potential candidates
nearly all of them referred to her as their friend and almost equal amount of affection and time was dedicated to the state's other beloved senator chuck grassley
walker who like cruz paced the stage back and forth as he spoke delivered an impressive speech that honed in on his record as governor
he talked about implementing voter id laws and he painted himself as the valiant warrior who took on the public employees and won during the collective bargaining rights debate of two thousand and eleven
he also didn't forget to mention that he's been elected three times in the past four years
shortly after his speech two men both from council <unk> talked outside about how they were <unk> by walker's remarks
if he could do on a nationwide scale what he did in wisconsin this country would be one man michael <unk> started to say before his friend bill <unk> <unk>
transformed
the country would be transformed
many attendees had a hard time picking just one favorite in the line of potential contenders
several mentioned fiorina as a surprise hit
there was just a pantheon of people to listen to said eric <unk> of cedar rapids
rick perry was better than last time i heard him that's good
he needs it said ernie rudolph of dallas county iowa
christie also saw a warm reception and contested the idea that a republican governor of a blue state who has a jersey guy reputation will not connect with voters in iowa
that somehow i'm too loud i'm too blunt and i'm too direct christie said dismissing the criticism as conventional wisdom from washington pundits
they're wrong
still he was noticeably different from his usual style
his demeanor was <unk> down and he read from his prepared remarks on the podium a stark contrast to his preferred off the cuff method
some of the chatter in the hallways and to reporters also featured two potential contenders who weren't there
jeb bush and mitt romney
trump put it simply
mitt had his chance
he should have won and he choked
as for bush
we've had enough of the bushes
sens
rand paul and marco rubio as well as gov
bobby jindal also skipped the event but given that it's year ahead before iowans start to caucus it's unlikely that missing one event will hurt them
saturday's event was more of a curtain <unk> giving the first glimpse of what will likely be a competitive republican primary
walker as he closed his speech offered a pledge that will likely be mirrored by several of the speakers on stage over the next year
i'm going to come back many more times
u.s. companies are reluctant to construct nuclear plants in india if they aren't shielded from liability after accidents an assurance indian lawmakers have been unwilling to extend
president barack obama and prime minister narendra modi stopped short of announcing a full <unk> deal but did say they'd moved forward on the issue
this is an important step that shows how we can work together to elevate our relationship obama said during a press conference that came after bilateral talks with modi
obama touched down in india on sunday for a <unk> state visit that has officials claiming a new era in u.s. india relations is <unk>
obama hopes to capitalize on his young friendship with modi to achieve diplomatic progress on climate defense and trade progress that has eluded u.s. leaders in the past
in a surprise break in protocol modi greeted obama on the tarmac on his arrival in new delhi and wrapped him in a hug
after a two leg sixteen hour journey air force one landed in new delhi under <unk> fog around ten a.m.
the <unk> indian capital was heavily fortified with extra security for the president's trip
police and military guards armed with machine guns <unk> roads and manned checkpoints throughout the city
highways were shut well ahead of obama's arrival
the normally chaotic traffic scene was unusually <unk> hours before obama's landing
even the city's stray dogs and monkeys were being <unk> away from the routes obama's motorcade was scheduled to drive

on monday obama will be the first u.s. leader to headline india's annual republic day parade a colorful military spectacle featuring marching bands dancing and lots of heavy machinery rolling down the stately rajpath boulevard
the white house says the invitation to act as the <unk> honored guest came as a major shock and could open the way for new cooperation between new delhi and washington
obama himself sees the invitation as a transformational moment for u.s. india relations according to his aides
i think it goes without saying that this is a seminal moment in the bilateral relationship and that the extension of this invitation by the prime minister really continues to set a different tone for our <unk> partnership said phil <unk> senior director for south asia on obama's national security council staff
but even the parade itself will act as a reminder of the decades of sometimes tense relations between the two countries
a military demonstration at heart the vehicles and equipment <unk> before obama on monday will be mostly russian made a <unk> of india's stance during the cold war
russia remains india's largest supplier of weapons and while their share is steadily decreasing russian military imports still amount to three quarters of india's stockpile
with u.s. russia relations worsening to cold war levels obama hopes to balance moscow's influence in india during his visit this week
officials also hope to exact climate commitments in new delhi where air quality warnings remained in place even during obama's visit
that's a contrast to obama's trip late last year to beijing where roads were cleared and the air <unk> of its usual smog ahead of the president's arrival
in china obama was able to secure historic carbon reduction promises from the new premier there though expectations for similar achievements in india were more measured
indians working in the capital city on sunday said they regarded obama's visit as a highly symbolic gesture from the united states one they said was well received despite the security headaches that his arrival caused

this is a smart move by obama and his foreign policy team
after all the world's most absolute monarchy and the world's most powerful democracy have long been allies because they are bound together not of course by common values but by common interests
the ready flow of reasonably priced oil and more recently the need to fight jihadist terrorist groups
however a number of significant tensions have arisen in the u.s. saudi relationship which a presidential visit likely will help to smooth over
the u.s. saudi marriage of convenience was first initiated on february fourteen one thousand nine hundred and forty five on a u.s. <unk> as it <unk> in the <unk> canal
it was on the deck of the uss quincy where president franklin <unk> roosevelt first met with saudi king abdul aziz to discuss areas of common interest
in the seven decades since that meeting the relationship has largely worked well for both countries
during most of that time saudi arabia provided economic support by ensuring a steady supply of oil and political backing for such american moves as the effort to <unk> saddam <unk> invasion of kuwait and to seek a two state solution to the israeli palestinian conflict
the relationship took a <unk> after the revelation that fifteen of the nineteen hijackers on nine eleven were saudis
but oil has a wonderful way of <unk> even the most troubled waters
even though the united states is not as dependent on saudi oil as many countries are the saudis can choose to raise or lower their oil production and those decisions have substantial effects on global oil prices
that's because saudi arabia is the world's largest oil producer and it has around a fifth of the world's proven oil reserves
today as oil prices are <unk> to prices we haven't seen since the great recession of two thousand and nine the saudis have not lowered their production of oil which is a great boon to the u.s. economy even as the saudis take a real hit resulting from their lower oil revenues
many suspect that an equally important motive for the saudi move is to weaken its arch nemesis iran also a major oil producer
despite saudi oil policies that benefit american economic interests the saudi american <unk> was more like a <unk> of minds under the george w. bush <unk> in recent years frayed
the saudis remain <unk> that obama didn't follow through on his red line threat to take action against the syrian regime of bashar al assad regime after it used chemical weapons on its population
syria is an ally of iran
the saudis are also watching the continuing iranian american dialogue over iran's nuclear program with great concern
they believe that the united states will get played by the iranians and will allow them to retain some kind of nuclear capacity suitable for making a nuclear weapon
the saudis are also still angry that the egyptian dictator hosni mubarak was abandoned by the obama administration during the arab spring of two thousand and eleven
how would washington react if the saudi monarchy faced its own serious internal opposition
would it too be thrown overboard
the saudis have also long <unk> the largely <unk> embrace of israel by both republican and democrat presidents
a common interest that <unk> many of these differences is syria where both washington and riyadh are threatened by the rise of isis and also of al qaeda's affiliate there the nusra front
as of early two thousand and fourteen some one thousand two hundred saudis had traveled to syria of whom two hundred and twenty had returned to the kingdom according to a senior saudi official
as a result there was great concern in the kingdom about the potential blowback problem posed by these militants with battlefield experience acquired in syria
that's why saudi arabia made it a crime in early two thousand and fourteen for its citizens to travel to fight in overseas conflicts such as the syrian war
that move coincided with the appointment of prince mohammed bin nayef to head the powerful saudi ministry of the interior
nayef who al qaeda's yemeni affiliate tried to assassinate in two thousand and nine has been an <unk> foe of jihadist groups in the arabian peninsula which has made him a vital ally of the united states
in many ways the real news about king abdullah's death which was long <unk> was the appointment of king salman and his brother muqrin as crown <unk> the appointment of the fifty five year old nayef as deputy crown prince
this passes the torch of saudi succession beyond the <unk> of king abdullah's brothers to a new generation
it also strongly signals that the saudi royal family values the firm stand on jihadist terrorist groups that is favored by nayef and by washington
that's why saudi planes are now taking part in the u.s. led coalition to bomb isis positions in iraq and syria
saudi arabia and the united states also have a strong interest in stabilizing the situation in yemen
houthi rebels have seized the yemeni capital sanaa and the largely pro american government of president hadi stepped down last week
both the saudis and the americans regard the al qaeda affiliate in yemen as a real threat and they also are both watching with alarm as houthi shia rebels whom the saudis view as <unk> of iran have taken over the yemeni ministries that have played a key role in fighting al qaeda
there will be much to discuss when the american president and his foreign policy team meet with the saudi king and his advisers on tuesday
one of the first statements she made before making a direct plea to isis to spare her son's life was an apology to the japanese people
thank you for your great kindness and i apologize for the tremendous inconvenience and trouble that my son has caused she said
the plea came just before a seventy two hour deadline for a two hundred million dollar ransom set in the video was due to expire
the japanese government appears not to have given into the demand and a day later her son appeared again this time holding a photo that purported to show the decapitated body of his compatriot haruna yukawa
now the jihadist group is demanding the release of sajida al rishawi a female terrorist being held in jordan in exchange for goto's life
<unk> public apology is understandable in the context of japanese society says jeff kingston director of asian studies at temple university's tokyo campus
in japan when you inconvenience people it's important to respect them and ask for forgiveness kingston says
ishido conveyed several times how badly she feels about her son's capture causing trouble for the japanese government and alarm for its people
to her it doesn't matter that her son was likely trying to rescue his friend and fellow hostage haruna yukawa
it doesn't matter than he has been praised by friends colleagues and strangers for reporting <unk> from war zones like syria with strong respectful determination
if she were to say such things publicly in japan she could be perceived as a selfish individual who touts the <unk> of her son
because of this ishido a desperate mother with a son in imminent danger of brutal murder at the hands of a militant jihadist group apologized to her country from the bottom of my heart
and then begged for help
i <unk> to the japanese government to save <unk> life ishido said
to all members of isis kenji is not the enemy of isis
please release him
kingston says public sympathy for the two hostages is mixed partly because of their vastly different backgrounds
there's a distinction in the public between goto and yukawa kingston told cnn ahead of the news of yukawa's apparent murder
there is a great deal of respect for the journalist and what he's done and his experience
yukawa is looked at as a nave adventurer who put himself in harm's way
so many are asking why should it be the government and the <unk> problem
in two thousand and four three young japanese hostages were released by militants in iraq
instead of being welcomed home they were shunned for causing trouble for japan
the former hostages including one who was in iraq helping children before her capture were even billed by the government for their <unk>
they got the <unk> unwelcome you can imagine
it was essentially government encouraged bullying kingston says adding the trauma of their return was in some ways worse than their capture
in the previous hostage crisis under japan's former prime minister <unk> <unk> during the iraq war language like self responsibility and go at your own risk was <unk> into the japanese <unk>
for most japanese citizens areas of the middle east ravaged by conflict are perceived as distant dangerous places the opposite of the safety and calm that <unk> japanese society
many in japan don't understand why anyone would leave the island nation and travel to such hostile regions where they face potential capture by terror groups like isis
therefore many find it difficult to <unk> with those who choose to go
goto has received more sympathy because the japanese media has widely reported on his commitment to telling the stories of suffering women and children
according to his own online posts yukawa was a troubled man and as such he has received far less sympathy back home in japan
he lost his wife to cancer and then his home and business to bankruptcy
at one point he attempted suicide and took a traditionally female name
on the outside i look normal he wrote in one post
but inside i'm mentally ill
it seems he went to the middle east looking for a fresh start and wanted to be a private security contractor even though he had no experience
he's seen as irresponsible kingston says
kingston adds this latest incident has the potential to change the way japanese society feels about prime minister shinzo abe's approach of proactive <unk>
the isis video was released just two days after abe was in the middle east pledging two hundred million dollar in humanitarian aid to the coalition against isis a commitment the japanese government insists it will honor no matter what happens to the hostages
however the public might feel about the two men who they watched kneel in the desert on their computers and tv screens there is no doubt that the sight of their countrymen enduring capture at the hands of isis has brought the situation in iraq and syria into sharp relief
islamic extremism was something you watched on tv that happened to other people kingston says
and now it's happening to the japanese
mali had taken an early lead after striker bakary <unk> who plays for <unk> <unk> in the english championship <unk> powered home a right foot volley from close range

the ivory coast are now top of the group on two points with one game to play
despite the late goal ivory <unk> french coach <unk> <unk> a previous winner of the tournament as coach of zambia was not happy with some of the <unk> especially a first half penalty appeal for a foul on wilfried bony
i won't talk about anything but i was not upset against my players
i think you are able to understand against what i was upset but now it is too late to talk about that <unk> <unk> told afp
i don't like to create controversy after
all that leads to is being suspended
i need to remain calm he added
there were lots more good things today than in the first match but unfortunately we went behind early on
once again we struggled at the start of the game
i think if you look at the statistics they didn't have many shots on goal

cameroon took the lead rather <unk> when a benjamin <unk> corner went straight in before a goal by the highly rate <unk> <unk> before half time leveled the match

sajida al rishawi was sentenced to death for that attempt and jordan executed her early wednesday
isis had demanded her release threatening to kill two hostages if jordan didn't comply
isis carried out those killings and jordan carried out al rishawi's execution
but just who was she
and what's her connection to the new radical sunni group that controls big swaths of syria and iraq
al rishawi was referred to as an imprisoned sister of the terrorist group in a message purportedly posted online by a known isis supporter
the message proposed a swap of al rishawi for japanese hostage kenji goto
in the video goto was seen holding a photo of what appeared to be beheaded compatriot haruna yukawa
the online posts which cnn could not verify independently appeared four days after an isis video demanded that the japanese government pay two hundred million dollar within seventy two hours for the hostages release
in the latest recording the voice of a person claiming to be goto was heard in english blaming japanese prime minister shinzo abe for yukawa's death
forgoing the money the voice then issued a new isis demand
the release of al rishawi
they are just demanding the release of their imprisoned sister sajida al rishawi the voice said
al rishawi who was being held by authorities in jordan was not seen publicly in nine years
in a televised confession in november two thousand and five al rishawi calmly recounted how she tried to take part in a string of terror attacks at jordanian hotels that month that killed at least fifty seven people
my husband detonated his bomb and i tried to detonate mine but failed al rishawi said on jordanian television showing no emotion
people fled running and i left running with them
in two thousand and six al rishawi was sentenced to death but that same year jordan imposed a moratorium on the death penalty
executions resumed last month
wearing a white head scarf and black dress during the confession al rishawi displayed a belt rigged with explosives and crudely held together with tape
jordanian authorities said al rishawi now in her forty s joined her husband hussein ali al <unk> to carry out the suicide bombings at the <unk> hotel
his explosives went off killing thirty eight people attending a wedding reception in the ballroom
three male bombers and fifty seven bystanders were killed at three hotels in the series of attacks
she said she was an iraqi who lived in ramadi and using fake passports traveled to jordan with her husband
she told jordanian authorities that her husband taught her how to use her explosives belt
in the confession al rishawi said my husband is the one who organized everything
jordanian authorities at the time said the attacks were orchestrated by the terrorist group al qaeda in iraq which was led by jordanian born abu musab al zarqawi
al zarqawi was killed in a u.s. strike in june two thousand and six
a post on a website used by al qaeda in iraq claimed responsibility for the jordan attacks
deputy prime minister marwan muasher said after the attacks that al rishawi was the sister of <unk> right hand man who was killed in <unk> iraq
he did not identify the lieutenant
isis leader abu bakr al baghdadi was a lieutenant of al zarqawi retired lt. col. james reese a former u.s. delta force commander told cnn
there's a link back to this woman reese said of the alleged prisoner swap
this is just another way to help them bring these people back and help with their propaganda
in february two thousand and fourteen al qaeda <unk> ties to isis after months of infighting between isis and another group al nusra front
isis started in two thousand and four as al qaeda in iraq with the aim of creating an islamic state across sunni areas of iraq and in syria
after the jordan attacks muasher told cnn that al rishawi was not wearing an explosives belt when she was apprehended but two belts were found with her
one was filled with the explosive <unk> the other with ball bearings a technique used by the other bombers
the aim was to inflict the largest number of casualties he said
muasher said jordanian authorities had information that al rishawi's husband asked her to step out of the room when her explosives failed to detonate
in her confession al rishawi said she and her husband stood at opposite sides of the room for the double bombing
there was a wedding ceremony in the hotel she said
there were women men and children
southwest airlines flight two thousand four hundred and ninety two and delta flight one thousand one hundred and fifty six landed safely at the airport and were searched by bomb disposal units according to airline officials
nothing out of the ordinary was found officials said
one runway was closed temporarily causing delays for other flights as passengers on the two flights were questioned and their luggage was searched by bomb sniffing dogs officials said
delta spokesman morgan <unk> said it was a portland oregon to atlanta georgia flight
delta is supporting the sweeping process carried out by authorities
the southwest flight was coming from milwaukee wisconsin
the f sixteen fighter jets were from <unk> joint national guard base in south carolina and returned to the base after the passenger planes landed
what you see is a very hefty response said cnn aviation correspondent rene marsh
due to the current world wide terror threats no one wants to take the risk she said

but arguably the bigger shock took place in west london
at <unk> bridge chelsea the current premier league leaders who have looked <unk> all season took an early two goal lead against bradford city who play in english football's third tier
an easy victory looked on the cards
but chelsea somehow conspired to throw away their lead as bradford city scored an incredible four goals without reply
it was the first time chelsea have conceded four goals against opposition two leagues below them since the one thousand nine hundred and fifty s
before the game chelsea coach jose <unk> said it would be a <unk> if his team lost saturday's game
he didn't <unk> his words after the match either
i am ashamed <unk> told sky sports
the players should feel exactly the same
the english fa cup has long been famous for its tradition of seeing smaller teams upsetting the odds and beating more established opposition
in this moment i feel happy for them
i am honest <unk> said of bradford city's performance
the portuguese coach who has won the uefa champions league twice visited bradford city's dressing room after the game and congratulated the team on their performance
this is beauty of the fa cup he added
this happens here more than any other country
elsewhere it wasn't a good day for the top half of the english premier league
southampton who are currently third were also knocked out after losing three two to crystal palace whilst tottenham hotspur in sixth lost two one to recently promoted leicester city

louis van <unk> <unk> assembled team could not break down the fourth division team who featured former manchester united academy player luke <unk> once a contemporary of david beckham paul <unk> and ryan <unk>
the match finished zero zero securing cambridge united whose entire yearly wage bill is the same as argentina international angel di <unk> monthly paycheck a replay at old <unk> and a place in the fifth round draw
the atmosphere in the stadium with the crowd was fantastic van <unk> told the bbc after the game
i can only give the credit to cambridge united
every aspect of the match was against us
the pitch the referee everything
sunday's action went more to form with holders arsenal winning three two at second flight <unk>
goals from <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and tomas <unk> put the <unk> three one ahead although sam <unk> late second for the home side led to a few late scares

sarah palin the former alaska governor and two thousand and eight gop vice presidential candidate was asked by abc news if she's interested in running for the white house
of course she said during the interview which was conducted as she served wild <unk> chili to the homeless in las vegas
yeah i mean of course when you have a <unk> heart when you know that there is opportunity to do all you can to put yourself forward in the name of offering service anybody would be interested she said
from nevada palin headed to iowa where potential candidates are addressing a conservative forum
she is expected to speak saturday evening
palin told newspapers reporters in a des moines hotel lobby she's seriously interested in a two thousand and sixteen run
time will tell if that serious interest turns into a serious run
teasing a presidential run can become something of a hobby for people with a certain level of political celebrity
donald trump the reality tv star and real estate developer has teased runs for the white house during a few presidential cycles
he's in iowa this weekend too
he again didn't rule out a potential two thousand and sixteen run for himself saying if he actually launches a campaign he'd do it before june
i'm the one person who can make this country great again that's all i know he told reporters after his speech saturday
nobody else can
he said he didn't run in two thousand and twelve despite offering similar <unk> because he had <unk> obligations with nbc and he was still he said managing deals all over the world
what would separate him from the pack
my ability i've just done well
i've had many many many wins and i've had very few losses and when i had a loss i turned it around into a win he said
as for two of the top potential <unk> romney and jeb <unk> said both would ultimately fail
mitt had his chance he said
he should have won and he choked
you don't want to give a <unk> a second chance
we've had enough of the bushes trump said warning that the former florida governor's position on common core and immigration won't amount to a winning formula
carly fiorina the former hewlett packard ceo is also looking at a possible two thousand and sixteen run
i am a potential presidential candidate yes i am she told cnn
fiorina who lost the senate race to democrat barbara boxer in two thousand and ten came to the hawkeye state to this weekend to thank volunteers for her organization unlocking potential project that helps elect female republicans and to lay the ground work for a two thousand and sixteen run
i'm looking to build a team here build a ground game build political support to help me make a final decision
palin has been out of public service for a number of years after she resigned her governorship in two thousand and nine
since then palin has written books starred in a reality tv show about alaska offered her opinions on fox news and generally been agent <unk> within the gop
but most political watchers have thought her political career was behind her
palin also teased a presidential run in two thousand and eleven but ultimately decided against it
not being a candidate really you are <unk> and you're able to be even more active she told the conservative radio host mark levin at the time
i need to be able to say what i want to say
the number of cases has increased to sixty eight with forty eight of those cases linked to an outbreak at disneyland state health officials reported friday
two days ago the health department reported fifty nine cases forty two with a disney connection
in addition nine cases have been reported in arizona utah washington colorado oregon and mexico
a new case was reported in nevada but the southern nevada health district said it's unknown whether that case is disney related
the disease outbreak apparently surfaced when visitors reported coming down with measles after visiting the park december fifteen twenty
at least five disney employees have been diagnosed with measles disney said
measles is a highly communicable respiratory disease caused by a virus and spread through the air according to the centers for disease control and prevention
measles starts with a fever runny nose cough red eyes and sore throat the cdc said
dr. gil chavez deputy director of the state's center for infectious diseases recommended that children under twelve months and people who've never had a measles vaccination stay away from the park while the disease event continues
he made the same recommendation for other places where large numbers of people <unk> such as airports and shopping malls
however chavez said disneyland would be perfectly safe if you've been immunized
when asked for a comment <unk> brown of disney media relations said we agree with dr. <unk> comments that it is safe to visit disneyland if you have been vaccinated
for the most part measles spreads among those who have not been vaccinated against the virus
the california department of public health said orange county had the most measles cases with twenty one followed by san diego county with thirteen
five things to know about measles
officer <unk> mcmillin gave chase his body cam capturing his shadow as he trailed the suspect in the afternoon light of january seventeen
walker twenty one is seen stopping suddenly and bending down to pick up something he dropped on the road
a white car approaches
the graphic video shows mcmillin pulling his pistol taking aim and <unk> five shots
walker turned around then started running
he was struck three times police said
in the video walker is seen as he <unk> to the ground then rolls into a ditch
he died at the scene
later the video shows an emotional mcmillin leaning against a police car
why did have to do that
he asked as other officers comforted him
since ferguson missouri teen michael brown's death prompted a national move to put body cameras on all america's police officers scenes like the one captured in the body cam video from <unk> will likely become more common
president barack obama recently announced a two hundred and sixty three million dollar package to help local police departments buy fifty thousand cameras
the new york police department the nation's largest launched a pilot body camera program in december
in <unk> about fifty of its eighty eight police officers started wearing body cameras in november according to department spokesman sgt
michael mahan
the january seventeen incident outside old agency baptist church is the first officer involved shooting captured by a body camera
the video was released friday after the department showed it to walker's family and local leaders in an attempt to quell tensions in the community mahan said
we've seen a lot of departments have a bunker mentality and sort of <unk> themselves and not be real open with the public he said
we're trying to set a precedent
we think this doesn't allow any speculation to foster within the community and lets all the facts come out
the encounter began with mcmillin approaching walker outside the church and <unk> him down
relax the officer is heard saying in the video moments before walker takes off running
what are you shaking for
mahan said witnesses told police that on the day of the shooting walker had threatened his ex girlfriend who was attending a wedding at the church that day
mahan said walker allegedly told his ex that he had a bullet with her name on it
moments after the shooting a man who identified himself as the church's pastor is seen in the video approaching the officer and saying
don't shoot no more
mcmillin ordered the pastor to stand back
the officer can be heard on his radio calling for an ambulance
another officer checked on walker and picked up something off the ground and tossed it away from the suspect
mcmillin is heard saying it's a handgun
another officer said the weapon was loaded
one officer checked walker's pulse
the pastor is seen in the video telling other officers that mcmillin did everything right
the investigation is being handled by the oklahoma bureau of investigation
mcmillin is on paid administrative leave mahan said
it was his second officer involved shooting in six months
the officer was cleared in the july shooting of a suspect who attacked a man with a knife according to mahan
the officer opened fire after the knife wielding man moved toward him
the suspect survived
what we're trying to do is to set a standard for the nation and say that we believe that openness and transparency is the best policy he said
abdullah also seemed to possess the political <unk> necessary to adjust to the changing needs and increased political awareness of the saudi <unk> as well as to the shifting political realities in the middle east and elsewhere
abdullah didn't officially ascend until two thousand and five but he had been the de facto king since one thousand nine hundred and ninety five when his predecessor and half brother <unk> health started failing
it was abdullah who had to steady the ship during the tumultuous aftermath of the september eleven attacks on the united states and subsequent terrorist attacks inside the kingdom in two thousand and three and two thousand and four
the specter of terrorism not only forced some to question the foundation of saudi arabia's special relationship with the us but also posed a serious threat to the stability of the regime by challenging its islamic bona <unk> on which its entire claim to legitimacy rests
although it was the late interior minister <unk> bin abdulaziz and his successor who devised the kingdom's multi pronged counter terrorism strategy part security operation part public awareness campaign that largely contained the threat from al qaeda abdullah's <unk> and assurances to saudis and the international community should not be underestimated
many might remember abdullah for his foreign policy initiatives including his plan for comprehensive peace between israel and its arab neighbors adopted first by the arab league in two thousand and two and then again two thousand and seven or his efforts to foster <unk> understanding by sponsoring international forums aimed at bringing together followers of various religions to stress their shared values as his meeting with pope benedict in two thousand and nine illustrated
but many saudis are likely to think of him as the king who tried to dispel any lingering doubts about the validity of the narrative around which the state was founded
the idea of a saudi nation and its <unk> notion of a unifying saudi identity
abdullah convinced many saudis that they are not merely passive observers but rather stakeholders in a still ongoing nation building endeavor
although he sometimes used the stern <unk> of an <unk> <unk> as he did when he encouraged saudis not to become their own worst enemy by questioning each other's <unk> the frank tone he often used in his speeches ushered in a new era where saudis of all walks of life felt more open to speak about not only what they considered to be the main <unk> <unk> the kingdom's development but also some of the obstacles standing in the way of their own self <unk>
many in the saudi media and burgeoning saudi civil society following the king's lead felt emboldened to write and speak about subjects that were once considered off limits including extremism among some clerics government corruption the role of women child and <unk> abuse and the <unk> of the educational <unk>
that is not to say that red lines do not remain and that some have not crossed them and paid a price
the imprisonment of some outspoken advocates of reform in two thousand and fourteen brought saudi arabia intense scrutiny from human rights organizations and the western media
those who apparently stepped over the red lines included long time activists as well as two young women with large <unk> on social media who tried to cross the saudi border while driving
the case of young blogger raif badawi who was accused of insulting the religious establishment garnered special attention as his sentence included weekly public flogging
these cases prompted some to question whether the saudi government was serious about reforms
abdullah's establishment of periodic national <unk> allowed some leading saudis to have these important debates openly
while criticized by some as mere photo ops these meetings brought together saudis from different ends of the political and religious spectrum including some leading sunni and shia clerics who would not have had the opportunity to meet face to face in such a public fashion
abdullah also expanded the membership of the <unk> shura council which now includes thirty women
just as importantly it was under his reign that thousands of saudis experienced their first taste of democratic politics when they participated in nation wide elections for municipal councils in two thousand and five
the fact that many saudis took their children and even grandchildren with them to the polling booths indicates the symbolic importance of this exercise
in two thousand and eleven abdullah took a calculated risk by declaring that women will be eligible to participate and run in the next round of elections in two thousand and fifteen
much like his pet project the king abdullah university for science and technology a <unk> graduate level institution aimed at preparing saudis to compete in the global economy abdullah's initiatives to empower saudi women <unk> conservative elements who continue to view any change as inherently destructive
but one of the keys to the longevity of al saud has been their ability to balance the competing and conflicting interests of the various segments of saudi society and to reach a general consensus
king abdullah's reign however was not controversy free
the saudi military's struggles against the vastly under equipped houthi rebels of northern yemen in two thousand and nine compelled some to question the preparedness of the army despite the billions of dollars spent on high tech weaponry and extensive training
the kingdom's dispatch of troops to neighboring bahrain in two thousand and eleven to help quell months of unrest in the tiny monarchy was criticized by <unk> shia majority not to mention iran and also raised eyebrows in the international community
intermittent clashes between saudi security forces and the shia majority in the kingdom's eastern province also created a sense of unease among some who considered the unrest a harbinger of the arab <unk> arrival to the kingdom
along the same lines and although widely hailed in the west as a positive move saudi arabia's participation in the u.s. led airstrikes against isis strongholds in syria was not risk free and seems to have only intensified the terror group's animosity for the saudi government and leadership
the saudis have apparently also agreed to train moderate syrian fighters on saudi soil an uncharacteristically forceful and public <unk> of its involvement in the syrian crisis
despite what some considered his weak <unk> ties within the royal family abdullah's popularity among saudis seemed to have been rooted in his realization that the <unk> most important base of support going forward must be the saudi <unk> at large
it is noteworthy that even some of the saudi government's harshest critics both inside and outside the kingdom seldom blamed abdullah personally for what they considered to be the kingdom's shortcomings
although some maintain that the persona of the wise yet humble <unk> was carefully constructed abdullah's <unk> demeanor and seemingly genuine concern for the well being of average saudis <unk> him to many
most saudis will remember him fondly
as for the new king salman it is <unk> to remember that some in the international community also expressed <unk> about king abdullah before he ascended the throne
he was perceived by some as more conservative and less pro western than his predecessor fahd
some thought that these leanings would manifest themselves in a more pan arab stance and a less <unk> posture towards the west and especially the us
those fears were largely unfounded
while there is little doubt that the syrian crisis the aftermath of the arab spring and nuclear negotiations with iran have created what seemed at times to be a serious rift in saudi u.s. relations it is highly <unk> that it was king abdullah alone whose views on these issues differed from those of the u.s
these still unresolved crises and <unk> will likely continue to be sticking points under king salman
king salman will likely <unk> some top government positions around and his style might be a little different than abdullah's
at some point he will likely try to put his own stamp on the throne
that however is not likely to be by changing the nature of saudi u.s. relations in any fundamental way
some have argued that the secret to the longevity of the saudi royal family is its careful attention to three <unk>
islam oil and its relations with the u.s. salman is not likely to lose sight of that
under salman bilateral relations with the u.s. will likely continue to be special
<unk> who had not performed well during friday's super g recorded a time of fifty eight point one six seconds two <unk> of a second ahead of the italian <unk> paris
the time was half of what would usually be expected to win the title
appalling weather conditions including heavy fog and snow <unk> <unk> the race
such was the poor visibility that the organizers moved the start to the <unk> jump half way down the two mile course
it meant that many of the <unk> most terrifying features including the opening <unk> or mousetrap which sees competitors reach speeds of close to one hundred mph had to be <unk>
<unk> had predicted that the course would be easier than usual
in a tweet sent before the race he said that the course was now a tiger turned into a kitten but still
safety first
but that didn't <unk> from what must rank as the highlight of <unk> career so far
winning in <unk> has been a goal for many years the twenty nine year old said after his victory
to make it happen is pretty extraordinary
in the women's downhill in st <unk> lindsey vonn finally proved she was <unk> after a rare mistake saw her finish twenty three rd
vonn who wore the slogan i'm the best on her <unk> had the chance to extend her world cup win record
instead <unk> lara gut gave the home crowd something to cheer with a winning time of one minute forty three point eight two seconds
i simply looked to find the <unk> line gut said after her victory
it was very tough to ski
in the midst of that horror indeed in perhaps the most horrific place a jew could land at the time prisoners sought to take their images back and made sure that art was still present
<unk> <unk> a polish artist and political prisoner at auschwitz made portraits of fellow prisoners
though the portraits portrayed prisoners of various nationalities and ages they shared the same haunting quality according to <unk> sieradzka an art historian at the auschwitz <unk> state museum
the most interesting in these portraits are eyes a very strange <unk> she says
prisoners created portraits because the desire to have an image was very strong
sieradzka believes <unk> made the portraits because he was aware they would one day become important historical documents
almost every portrait features the subject's prisoner number which gives historians a name to attach to the pictures
more than one hundred of <unk> portraits are housed in the auschwitz <unk> museum a memorial and museum at the site of the nazi concentration camps in german occupied poland
the gallery has more than two thousand pieces of art created inside various nazi camps or after the war
through the years <unk> is said to have hidden his portraits in his bed or in his clothes
the drawings managed to survive until he was liberated
after his death in one thousand nine hundred and forty six his family donated his portraits to the museum
one of the most important pieces in the museum collection is a <unk> containing twenty two pictures most likely drawn in one thousand nine hundred and forty three by an unknown prisoner at auschwitz
the <unk> is the only artwork documenting <unk> at <unk>
the sketches were found in one thousand nine hundred and forty seven two years after liberation near <unk> <unk>
they had been stuffed into a bottle and hidden in the foundations of one of the buildings
some would be surprised that art existed in a place like that in a place with <unk> but art was especially needed here behind the barbed wire because the art could save a part of their human dignity says sieradzka
the art was a hope for a better future
the art was escape from the brutal reality of the camp to another better world
according to sieradzka nazi ss officers commissioned some of the works
<unk> gifted prisoners made <unk> drawings and models for the military
ss soldiers also exploited the prisoners talents for private purposes making them create portraits landscapes greeting cards and illustrations of german legends
soldiers sent some of the art to their families or displayed it in the camp's own gallery the <unk>
that museum also held items taken from those deported to the camp including <unk> jewish prayer books and garments
for sieradzka the most valuable and important work is the art prisoners made at great risk in secret
prisoners couldn't use materials from ss officers for private purposes
it was forbidden but prisoners many times carried out illegal activity and used these materials for illegal artworks she says these paintings and drawings play a very important educational role as <unk> of what happened at auschwitz
prisoners made art using whatever materials they could find scraps of paper <unk> paper the backs of old letters
they made sculptures using bread and <unk> says sieradzka
the art was forbidden in auschwitz so creating a drawing like that means risking torture even death however the art existed here almost from the beginning she says
jan <unk> was a polish catholic arrested while crossing the border in attempt to reach the newly formed polish army in france
he had escaped auschwitz once but was <unk> in krakow
after he was liberated he <unk> to the united states became a u.s. citizen and worked for the washington post newspaper as an illustrator
before he passed away in two thousand and two he painted works depicting daily life in the camp scenes of barbarity at the hands of the ss and humanity and compassion between fellow prisoners
thanks to these artworks we could also see auschwitz and the camp in the eyes of prisoners
and this is very unique because we haven't photos depicting everyday life of prisoners in the camp says sieradzka
through these works she says we can see the truth about auschwitz
yet nowadays this region is especially turbulent with waves rocking several countries so big that their effects are being felt worldwide including the west
it's not like this <unk> is concentrated only in one country or all for a common reason
there's islamic extremism political turnover faltering oil prices and let's not forget age old sectarian tensions that are contributing in different ways in different places to the <unk>
many countries in the region have issues such as egypt's delicate political and human rights situation and turkey's dealing with the impact of the war raging right over its border in syria
still a few stand out because of the unique some might say intractable challenges they face
chaos is one way to describe it
the country's government is in a shambles
violence some of it sectarian some of it thanks to <unk> from al qaeda in the arabian peninsula has been raging nationwide for months if not years
and it's far and away the poorest nation in the region with a per capita gdp of one thousand four hundred and seventy three dollar according to the world bank
let's start with the still unfolding political crisis
yemen's president and prime minister abruptly resigned thursday after houthi rebels moved on the capital sana'a
how yemen's new government will look is still unclear if it's going to have a functioning government at all
if the houthis take the lead that would mean shiites ruling a country that's mostly sunni
while the houthis and previous government both fought against al qaeda this instability can only help that terror group
and none of this is helping the average yemeni stuck in poverty with little time money or effort seemingly focused on improving their straits or the economy as a whole
why it matters to the west and beyond
for the rest of the world political stability is a good thing for any country in this region
on the flip side instability is always a concern
there's also the fact that yemen has enough oil and natural gas for its people and export though unrest makes it challenging to tap into these resources the u.s. energy information administration notes
all those worries and impacts are real
but for the west it's about aqap
ever since osama bin laden was <unk> out of afghanistan the terrorist organization he founded has spread out and evolved
rather than one overarching entity al qaeda is now more of an association of groups each with its own goals even if they all share a philosophy of lashing out at the west and promoting their extreme brand of islam
and of those aqap is widely considered the most dangerous to the west
it's the only al qaeda affiliate to send terrorists from yemen to the united states
there was umar farouk abdulmutallab better known as the underwear bomber for his attempt to blow up a commercial airliner on a detroit bound flight in december two thousand and nine
then there are the suspects in the deadly boston marathon bombings and nidal hassan who reportedly were inspired by american born cleric and top aqap figure anwar al awlaki
the united states isn't the only place affected
aqap has claimed to be behind the january seven charlie hebdo massacre and one of the brothers involved cherif kouachi told cnn affiliate bfm that he trained in yemen on a trip financed by al awlaki
al awlaki is dead but his organization is not
with both yemen's government and the houthis focused on each other aqap has more space to recruit and train terrorists as well as devise ways for them to strike
yemen's political upheaval is especially unsettling for countries like the united states which had a strong working alliance with now departed president abdu rabu mansour hadi and his government
as of thursday u.s. officials haven't held any talks with the houthis nor did they know their intentions
since its founding in one thousand nine hundred and thirty two the kingdom of saudi arabia has been one of the most stable not to mention richest countries in not just the middle east but the world
it had a new new leader friday and let's just say the timing could have been better
saudi arabia has had political transition before with six kings in its modern day history the latest being king salman who took power friday following the death of his half brother king abdullah bin abdulaziz
the new leader has already signaled that he won't <unk> much from his predecessor's policies saying we will with god's will and power adhere to the straight path this country has followed since its establishment
still change is change and king salman will be challenged from the get go
riyadh has long played a part in stabilizing the region a role that is needed as much as ever
iraq is battling isis militants who already control much of the country and are threatening to take the rest
the sunni led government in neighboring yemen is out with uncertainty of what comes next or whether some of its violence will spill over into saudi
and there's the threat from across the persian gulf in iran
on top of all this the price of the arab nation's economic driver oil has plummeted over fifty percents since the summer to less than fifty dollar a barrel
that's key because oil revenues are a bit part of saudi government's revenues and a big reason it's so important on the world stage
why it matters to the west and beyond
the middle east is unstable enough especially since the arab spring
the saudi government was one a few regional governments to weather that storm smoothly
but now there's even more need for stability something that having a new leader may not help with
it is very possible that saudi policy doesn't change much under king salman
even if that's true it's much too early to tell whether or not he can be a leader throughout the region
can or will he try to help broker peace between palestinians and israel as did king abdullah
can or will he be able to have any influence keeping yemen under control
likewise it's not yet clear how the transition will affect the saudi government's relationship with the united states whose leaders have long been able to count on riyadh for counsel and support
another possible impact of king salman's ascension has nothing to do with geopolitics but rather how much you pay at the gas pump
the new king could decrease the amount of oil pumped in saudi arabia which would decrease supply and increase prices
even without any saudi action the price of oil has already started climbing after king abdullah's death
syria's upheaval began in spring two thousand and eleven with protests in the nation's streets
president bashar al assad's government responded with a deadly crackdown an act that only seemed to fuel the unrest
and it only got worse from there
eventually the <unk> and violence devolved into a full <unk> civil war
it's been a bloody war with the united nations estimating nearly two hundred thousand killed as of last august
it's been a disruptive war with more than three million syrians now refugees and at least six point five million more displaced inside the country
and it hasn't been a simple war given all the warring parties involved
that's because there isn't just one united opposition group fighting against al assad who is still in power and entrenched in damascus
there are more moderate fighting groups some of which have gotten support from washington and beyond
and there are extremists who have been able to attract new recruits gain more influence and take over territory amid the chaos
one of them is al nusra front an al qaeda affiliate the u.s. state department has designated a terrorist organization that's taken over territory in northwestern syria
another is isis which first emerged in iraq but got a second life in syria thanks to the ongoing war
it has terrorized many in both countries in recent months a time in which its taken over vast swaths of territory established a de facto capital in the syrian city of <unk> and <unk> itself the islamic state in accordance with its quest to be a caliphate governed under its strict interpretation of sharia law
why it matters to the west and beyond
even before isis made daily headlines the horrors of what's been happening in syria was enough to get the world's attention
with large numbers of civilians dying with the alleged use of chemical weapons with neighboring countries like turkey and jordan finding themselves swarmed by refugees it couldn't be avoided from a practical and personal standpoint
none of those concerns have gone away
syria borders turkey a nato member as well as jordan and israel two staunch u.s. allies
besides the refugee issue there is a constant threat that the violence will spill over the syrian border
even without that a seemingly endless civil war in this part of the world is never good for most anyone the west included
it's not just that there's violence it's who is behind it and in many ways thriving because of it
isis wouldn't be what it is without the syrian civil war
that means it wouldn't be a focal point for u.s. president barack obama and his government
already isis has beheaded a number of u.s. and british hostages all of them civilians and threatened more
there's also the real threat that the group may take its campaign out of the middle east to strike in the west
that may have happened this month in france
one of the three terrorists there amedy coulibaly proclaimed his allegiance to isis in a video and investigators discovered isis flags along with automatic weapons detonators and cash in an apartment he rented france's rtl radio reported sunday citing authorities
the west and some of its middle eastern allies are striking back with targeted airstrikes not only in iraq where the coalition has a willing partner but in syria where it is not working with al assad
u.s. diplomatic officials said thursday that estimates are that this coalition has killed more than six thousand isis fighters
yet their work is far from done
the group boasts upwards of thirty one thousand fighters not to mention fresh recruits seemingly coming in regularly
iraq is no stranger to war in recent decades from its war with iran in the one thousand nine hundred and eighty s to the first gulf war in the early one thousand nine hundred and ninety s to a u.s. led invasion in two thousand and three
and it has seen plenty of bad actors in that stretch like late leader saddam hussein who used chemical weapons against his enemies including the one thousand nine hundred and eighty eight attack on the kurdish town of <unk>
even then isis stands out
the group began in two thousand and four as al qaeda in iraq a particularly destructive arm of bin laden's terror network with an <unk> for attacking coalition forces as well as those locals who didn't accept this sunni group's extreme islamic beliefs
international military efforts helped to beat back the group but it never totally went away
<unk> as the islamic state the terror group came back stronger and seemingly more brazen than ever
it killed and kidnapped including many civilians using tactics so extreme that even al qaeda <unk> it
members of the minority <unk> group reported being treated like cattle as their men were slaughtered and their women and girls were raped and sold
it distributed a pamphlet in mosul justifying its enslaving and having sex with <unk> women and girls
it's not just that isis is despicable
it's been successful
the terror group has taken over large <unk> of territory in iraq including oil fields and the key city of mosul and even threatened its capital of baghdad
why it matters to the west and beyond
iraq matters because it has been a place where islamist extremists can strike the west
for years that meant attacking coalition military forces based there
now that they are gone the fear is that iraq will become a training ground for isis militants to prepare for strikes outside the middle east
that's why in august obama authorized the first of what have come to be hundreds of targeted airstrikes conducted with international allies to counter militants in iraq as well as syria
it appears to have made a difference not only in killing the estimated six thousand isis fighters but in helping iraqi forces reclaim territory
u.s. secretary of state john kerry said thursday that iraq has taken back more than two hundred and seventy square miles
iraqi prime minister haider al abadi told cnn's christiane amanpour this week he expects isis even if it is not eliminated entirely should be gone from his country within months claiming the group's onslaught
has been reversed
i think we have the capability now with enough support from the international coalition al abadi said
any such predictions need to be taken with a grain of salt
that's especially true in iraq where terrorists have been reportedly ousted before only to return
plus it is not as though the end of isis necessarily will signal an end to iraq's problems
like saudi arabia this big time oil producer has to cope with the impact of lower prices
and there was violence before isis surge including a good number of terrorist attacks so it seems unrealistic to expect that will go away
the islamic revolution happened in one thousand nine hundred and seventy nine
there has been occasional protests since then but none have amounted to anything
in some ways politically iran has been the picture of stability with two overarching leaders in the past thirty six years with ayatollah <unk> <unk> and his successor ali khamenei
yet iran's relations with the rest of the world haven't been so calm
part of it has to do with iranian leaders hard line stance against israel as illustrated in ayatollah khamenei's nine point explanation last november for why israel should be <unk>
the ayatollah and his supporters haven't been much kinder to the united states with spirited anti american rallies and harsh criticisms of washington common
then there's iran's nuclear program one that since two thousand and three has fueled concern worldwide that tehran's plans are not simply energy development as iranian officials have said but may be to develop nuclear <unk> that could strike israel and beyond
this dispute has led to major sanctions on iran hurting that nation's economy and isolating it from much of the world
but there's been some signs of hope since the two thousand and thirteen election of president hassan rouhani
since then the rhetoric has notably <unk>
and while there's been no conclusive deal at least iran has engaged in constructive talks with western officials on the nuclear issue
why it matters to the west and beyond
think of it this way
would you want leaders of a country known for death to america chants to have a nuclear weapon
the united states sure does not
nor do its european allies
and certainly neither does israel
one concern is that all of these recent negotiations are simply <unk>
iran some skeptics say may be inching closer to producing nuclear weapons behind everyone's backs while they talk peace
and it's not as though every leader in iran is embracing peaceful rhetoric
nuclear weapons or not seemingly anything could tip the scales toward war
the latest point of contention relates to an israeli attack in syria's golan heights that killed a senior iranian commander and six hezbollah members
speaking about that incident thursday according to state run press tv the iranian revolutionary <unk> brig
gen. <unk> <unk> said
should be waiting for crushing responses
israel is one of most modern progressive prosperous countries
but ever since its founding in one thousand nine hundred and forty eight it has also been one of the most challenged when it comes to security and that hasn't changed
hamas and israeli forces fought for seven weeks this summer in gaza a conflict that killed more than two thousand one hundred and thirty palestinians most of them civilians according to the united nations
sixty seven israelis sixty four of them soldiers have been killed the u.n. reported
a foreign worker in israel was killed as well
the violence has died down since then but it hasn't gone away
there was a november attack at a jerusalem synagogue that killed four <unk> and a police officer
an israeli soldier was stabbed to death on a tel aviv street with another killed at a west bank <unk> post
many palestinians have been caught up in everything as well like a senior palestinian authority official who died after a confrontation with israeli troops
no three rd <unk> yet but few signs of hope either
meanwhile there's an election coming up in israel
prime minister benjamin netanyahu is contending to stay in the office he's held since two thousand and nine hoping to convince voters that he's the right person to address a faltering economy recent attacks against israelis in jerusalem and this summer's inconclusive war against hamas
in fact he's taking his appeal on the road to the united states
house speaker john boehner has invited netanyahu to speak to congress on march three
but he won't be meeting with obama then a fact that some see as the latest evidence of the reportedly frosty relationship between the two leaders
why it matters to the west and beyond
israel is important to the united states for a few reasons
some of that has to do with the countries common democratic ideals
there is also the shared strategic and security interests as it is no coincidence that many of israel's foes are also u.s. enemies
and there's a political component as well with many in the united states valuing the country's relationship with israel and sometimes poking their political opponents claiming they're not sufficiently supportive
if the leaders of these two longtime allies aren't on the same page that could be a problem
obama won't personally meet with netanyahu during his next visit because white house spokesman josh earnest said we want to avoid even the appearance of any kind of interference with a democratic election on march seventeen
then there's the prospect that netanyahu will press for stronger sanctions on iran
this <unk> him into the u.s. political fray since the iran talks have pitted obama against republicans and democrats alike
this visit certainly won't help mend what aaron david miller a former u.s. middle east peace negotiator has described as a dysfunctional relationship between netanyahu and obama
as a senior official with a prominent pro israel policy organization in washington said last fall
these guys don't like each other
they don't pretend to like each other
the static image shown in a video file posted by a known isis supporter shows surviving japanese hostage kenji goto alone in handcuffs and dressed in orange holding a photo of what appears to be beheaded compatriot haruna yukawa
japanese prime minister shinzo abe said sunday that the video is highly credible
u.s. authorities said they had no reason to doubt its authenticity
abe told japanese broadcaster nhk that the killing was <unk> and <unk> demanding the immediate release of goto
i still don't want to believe it shoichi yukawa said his face not shown in the report
if i can see him again i'd like to hold him in my arms
saturday's posting came four days after an isis video demanded that the japanese government pay two hundred million dollar within seventy two hours for the two hostages release
in the video released saturday the voice of a person claiming to be goto says in english that abe is to blame for yukawa's death
you were given a deadline he says
the voice then <unk> the apparent new demand from isis the release of sajida al rishawi a woman arrested in jordan in two thousand and five on suspicion of trying to take part in an attack in which others killed dozens at jordanian hotels
they no longer want money so you don't need to worry about funding terrorists the voice says
they are just demanding the release of their imprisoned sister sajida al rishawi
jordan's king abdullah ii and abe talked by phone on saturday according jordanian state news agency petra
the news agency did not detail what the two discussed beyond saying they reviewed the latest developments in the middle east
president barack obama condemned the purported murder of yukawa by isis
in a white house statement the president expressed condolences to the people of japan and said the united states will work with its ally to bring the perpetrators of these murders to justice and will continue to take decisive action to degrade and ultimately defeat isis
britain's prime minister david cameron said japan was right not to bow to the terrorists demand for ransom
britain strongly supports the firm stance prime minister abe and his government have taken and we will continue to work with japan and other partners around the world to promote peace and to build a safer more secure future for our citizens cameron said in a statement
secretary of state john kerry said the u.s. is grieving with yukawa's family
america has known this pain and horror ourselves and we stand with japan not just in sadness but in solidarity and strength he said in a statement
the u.s. national security council has seen saturday's post and the intelligence community is working to confirm its authenticity <unk> deputy spokesman patrick <unk> said
goto forty seven and yukawa forty two had gone to the middle east for different reasons the former an experienced freelance journalist covering the conflict in iraq and syria and the latter an aspiring security contractor who felt at home in the war torn region
they ended up in the hands of isis in recent months
on tuesday isis released a photo showing a black clad masked man standing over goto and yukawa
the man made a demand
either japan pay two hundred million dollar the same amount that abe has proposed to help those affected by the isis campaign money his government says is for humanitarian rather than military purposes within seventy two hours or both men would die
japanese officials estimated that ultimatum expired at two fifty p.m. friday tokyo time with no immediate news on the hostages
saturday's video is dissimilar in some ways to last year's isis videos announcing the executions of western hostages
in five isis videos last year announcing the beheadings of u.s. journalists james foley and steven sotloff british aid worker david haines british taxi driver alan henning and u.s. aid worker peter kassig a masked man is shown making a statement and sometimes putting a knife to the hostages necks
the videos then transition to a still photo of the victims severed heads
al rishawi the woman named in the allegedly proposed swap for goto was arrested by jordanian authorities more than nine years ago
in november two thousand and five she said in a televised confession that she tried to take part in a string of terror attacks at jordanian hotels that month that killed at least fifty seven people
she said her explosives failed to go off at a large wedding reception she was targeting but that her husband's explosives did go off there
japan isn't part of the international military coalition that for months has been carrying out airstrikes against isis targets in iraq and syria
its post world war ii constitution forbids the use of japanese military forces for any purpose besides self defense
but tokyo is allied with the united states and others leading this military campaign
and japanese officials are offering help related to the ongoing unrest though they insist those millions of dollars would go toward things like helping refugees not killing isis militants
isis wasn't <unk>
in tuesday's video demanding ransom a masked man holding a knife stood over the kneeling goto and yukawa and said that abe willingly volunteered to take part in this crusade against isis
a spokesman for the terror group according to japanese broadcaster nhk wouldn't comment this week on whether his group has been in touch with the japanese government something that officials in tokyo had said they were trying to arrange
he said he was aware that japan said it wasn't involved militarily and called the japanese infidels for fighting with the coalition
japanese officials had said they would not yield to threats but they would do everything they could to secure the hostages safe release
would that mean paying ransom
officials weren't saying at least directly though abe did call isis demand unacceptable this week
leading japanese news organizations reported citing unidentified government sources that goto's wife received an e mail in december from someone demanding eight million dollar to sixteen million dollar for her husband's return
the government was trying to confirm if that e mail came from isis the reports said
if so it could indicate the militant group was willing to accept a smaller ransom than the two hundred million dollar it had publicly demanded
japanese citizens have been taken hostage before
some have been released
but what japan hasn't done is advertise whether it has ever paid ransom <unk> it encourage more kidnappings in bad guy fundraising schemes
it's not clear whether paying would have mattered
isis doesn't have representatives or go <unk> everywhere who could <unk> such a deal
nor does it have a reputation for morality and <unk> so there's no telling if it would have taken the money and killed anyway
and the fact the group publicly asked for two hundred million dollar a figure well above other ransom demands raised the prospect that it was never serious about negotiating
while there are certainly geopolitical implications this story is also about two men and the families they've left behind
as the apparent deadline approached goto's mother begged for her son's life
to all members of isis kenji is not the enemy of isis
please release him the mother junko ishido said friday
i have been just crying for the last three days filled with sadness
words fail to describe how i feel
kenji always has been a kind person ever since he was little
he was always saying i want to save the lives of children in war zones
her son had been a journalist for years contributing to nhk and other japanese news organizations
goto covered big stories hoping that by telling them he could make a difference
that's what spurred him to go to isis controlled territory in syria as he explained in an october video shot shortly before he ventured over the turkish border
syrian people suffering three years and a half
it's enough said goto forty seven
so i would like to get the story of what isis wants to do
alaaeddin al zaim who had worked with goto in syria previously says he warned him not to enter the isis stronghold of raqqa
i tell him it's not safe for you al zaim told cnn
but goto went anyway
he said according to al zaim i am not american i am not british
i'm japanese
i can go
the aims and activities of yukawa a forty two year old unemployed widower are murkier
he originally headed to the war ravaged country early last year to gain combat and survival experience to bolster his plans to set up a private security company said his friend nobuo kimoto
there yukawa met goto who gave him insights on how to survive there kimoto said
goto also introduced him to rebel fighters who are distinct from isis though both are fighting syrian president bashar al assad's forces
some of the rebels talked about their need for ambulances to shuttle the wounded
that plea spurred yukawa to start raising money for this cause after returning to japan according to kimoto
kimoto said he advised his friend to focus on building up his private security company
before he went back to syria in july a month before his reported capture yukawa told his friend about his clear sense of purpose when he was in that tumultuous middle eastern nation despite all its violence and other <unk>
i felt a chill when he said after returning home he felt in syria he was really living a life kimoto said
he seems to have felt satisfaction being there and living together with the locals
those arrested were two pairs of brothers interior minister jorge fernandez diaz told reporters saturday
what is especially noteworthy with the breakup of this cell are the many <unk> with the attacks in paris recently carried out against the charlie hebdo magazine fernandez said referring to the january seven massacre that ended with twelve dead
<unk> is a tiny seven square mile spanish <unk> bordering morocco across the strait of <unk> from spain
the suspects who are spanish citizens and are of moroccan origin are strongly radicalized and had psychological and physical training as well as training in the use of weapons said the minister while addressing reporters at an event of his ruling conservative party
willing to carry out an attack fernandez said
and according to the police to blow themselves up
vice president joe biden was originally set to have led a delegation to saudi arabia on obama's behalf
however the schedule for the president's departure from india has been adjusted to allow obama to stop in riyadh himself on his way home white house press secretary josh earnest said
funeral services were held friday for king abdullah bin abdulaziz al saud who died earlier that day
he was ninety
world leaders are now traveling to the saudi capital riyadh to offer condolences for abdullah's death and pay their respects to the new ruler
abdullah was seen by many as a cautious reformer who succeeded in securing broader freedoms in the conservative kingdom but fell short in gaining greater independence for women
his successor who is seventy nine faces a number of challenges as he takes up the <unk> including iran the rise of isis the crisis in neighboring yemen and the drop in oil prices
but salman has plenty of experience to draw on having served as defense minister and deputy prime minister of saudi arabia a vital u.s. ally in the middle east
like abdullah he is one of the dozens of sons of saudi arabia's founder king abdulaziz
obama is due to arrive in new delhi on sunday on a trip intended to foster progress in sometimes thorny u.s. india ties
on monday he will become the first american president to headline india's republic day parade standing beside indian prime minister narendra modi
why obama's trip to my homeland is meaningful
earnest said obama's schedule had been changed in coordination with the indian government and that he would now be leaving india after giving a speech on tuesday
the president regrets that he will be unable to visit agra during this trip earnest said
agra is where the spectacular taj mahal <unk> is located
biden will now remain in washington rather than go to saudi arabia
although no reason for the change of plan was given it follows criticism this month of the obama administration for its failure to send a senior representative to france for a huge unity march held in the wake of the paris terror attacks
the administration admitted it erred and dispatched u.s. secretary of state john kerry to paris the following week to offer the united states support and condolences
speaking to cnn's richard quest in davos switzerland on friday kerry said he expects no changes in his government's relations with saudi arabia with the change of kings
i don't anticipate anything based on the conversation we have had no he said
jordan's king abdullah and egypt's president abdel fattah al sisi both left davos early to attend the funeral on friday
in line with custom abdullah was laid to rest in an <unk> grave in a brief and simple ceremony after funeral prayers in <unk> imam turki bin abdullah grand mosque
the aircraft went down around four thirty p.m. friday at the marine corps air ground combat center in <unk> palms california
our hearts go out to the families and friends of the two marines we lost in this tragic accident maj. gen. michael <unk> said friday
the names of the marines will be released after the next of kin are notified
according to its website the marine corps air ground combat center's mission is to conduct relevant live fire combined arms training urban operations and joint coalition level integration training for marines and navy sailors
it's located in san <unk> county some one hundred and thirty miles east of los angeles and <unk> joshua tree national park
while missions in combat zones are obviously more dangerous there are many examples of fatal u.s. military aircraft crashes during training missions as well
last march for instance a f a eighteen c <unk> pilot died after a crash about seventy miles east of naval air station fallon in western nevada
the navy described the combat jet as a total loss
the marines have had their share of deaths during training missions as well
in two thousand and twelve seven marines died in a <unk> collision of two u.s. military helicopters along the arizona california border
six of those killed during what was called a routine training operation were based at california's camp <unk> while the other was out of <unk> arizona the marine corps said
the previous year the marines had at least three deadly incidents involving helicopter crashes in noncombat areas one off of hawaii another in the northern part of camp <unk> and the third on that same southern california base

four more bodies have been recovered said marshall supriyadi director of operations and training for indonesia's search and rescue agency
that brings the total number of victims now found to sixty nine
indonesian divers tried saturday to float the wreckage using a giant balloon said supriyadi
they made several <unk> to the fuselage to attach the balloon weighing around ten tons to the fuselage using ropes and belts and to inflate it
but the operation hit a <unk> when a belt broke as the team tried to bring the wreckage up to the surface
divers successfully carried out the same procedure with the tail section of the aircraft earlier this month
the aircraft went down on december twenty eight as it flew from the indonesian city of surabaya toward singapore with one hundred and sixty two people on board
it's believed many of the remaining bodies could be in the wreckage of the fuselage which searchers located ten days ago at the bottom of the sea
efforts to examine and get inside the wreckage have been hindered by high waves and strong currents
a top indonesian official said tuesday that the aircraft had climbed rapidly and then stalled shortly before it crashed
experts have speculated from the outset that storms might have played a role in the plane crash
amid increasingly bad weather one of the pilots had requested to deviate from the plane's planned route airasia has said

what didn't make the state of the union
the quiet moment was a rare incident of <unk> on obama's otherwise rigid daily agenda and as the leaders <unk> at the stone memorial in the midday sun white house aides say a personal chemistry between the two men began to form
what came afterward was a surprise to everyone
at a november meeting of asian leaders in <unk> the indian prime minister delivered obama an astounding request
become the first american president to headline india's republic day parade
obama agreed and on monday he will stand alongside modi to take in the colorful yearly spectacle marking the emergence of the world's largest democracy
the invitation obama's aides say came as a shock but also presented a diplomatic opening unseen between the two countries in decades
it took us by some surprise said ben rhodes the president's deputy national security adviser
i think sees this as a potentially <unk> if not transformational moment for the relationship

there's a great <unk> between the united states and india and our people but there's also a history that is complicated rhodes said
complicated is a mild way to describe the often tense relationship between the two countries at odds on trade climate and defense equipment for years
analysts say most of those tensions are likely to persist despite early efforts of modi's administration to foster closer bonds to the united states
longstanding concerns in india about close u.s. relations to regional rival pakistan have also <unk> even as washington's relationship with <unk> soured after the raid on osama bin laden's compound
with u.s. officials describing the relationship with pakistan on the uptick indian worry is growing
concern in india about america's continued support for pakistan is growing to a level that i haven't seen in well over a decade said rick rossow the <unk> chair in u.s. india policy studies at the center for strategic and international studies noting that the <unk> of u.s. troops in afghanistan has led to fears among the indian public that terrorists could cross through pakistan and into india
obama's visit the first time a president has traveled to india twice while in office won't allay those concerns completely
but his presence at the widely televised republic day military parade sends a unifying message according to experts

i think you will see the president and the prime minister make it a point to try to appeal to various kinds of symbolism and the president especially reach out and try to connect with the indian public said <unk> <unk> the director of the india project at the brookings institution

one area diplomats hope to make progress this week
india's nuclear liability law signed in two thousand and ten that essentially prevents american firms from constructing plants in the country
outside analysts say they expect some progress on easing the measure
on climate the white house wants to secure carbon reduction commitments in the model of what obama achieved in china late last year though such aggressive commitments aren't as likely on this trip experts say
we won't see a china style deal partly because india has spent the last few months separating itself away from the chinese position on this said brookings <unk> suggesting agreements on clean energy may be more likely
any major breakthrough with india would have been hard to imagine six months ago
analysts and even some diplomats hadn't seen huge potential for the obama modi meeting in september which was <unk> by the hurdle of ensuring modi would be allowed to enter the united states after being denied a visa a decade ago for alleged involvement in sectarian violence
that obama is now flying to new delhi at modi's invitation may be a signal of how quickly progress could be achieved on other more substantive fronts if the u.s. president can capitalize on his new friendship
what does the president of the united states want
does he want a best friend or does he want somebody that's going to carry through on commitments
said rossow
it's clearly the latter
opinion
is india getting nostalgic over russia ties
there are of course the obvious <unk> differences
president barack obama studied law at harvard <unk> golf and prefers his suits sober in dark gray or navy blue
prime minister narendra modi had a modest education <unk> by yoga and readily wears flamboyant hats depicting india's diverse heritage
and then there's the small matter of paperwork
modi was a <unk> in the united states just one year ago his visa revoked over his handling of riots in two thousand and two when he was chief minister of the state of gujarat
but what a difference a year and a big electoral victory makes
when president obama arrives in new delhi on sunday he will have met modi four times in five months
at the white house at the east asia summit in myanmar at the g twenty summit in australia and now in india
the latest visit is the most significant
obama will become the first u.s. president to visit india twice and the first american chief guest at india's republic day parade
it's an open declaration of friendship
what explains this unlikely <unk>
aides on both sides have pointed out that when the two leaders met in washington in september there was a palpable chemistry
they shared a sense of priorities of where they wanted the alliance to head
on his previous visit to india in two thousand and nine obama spoke of the two democracies forming one of the defining partnerships of the twenty one st century
but in those initial years the partnership became strained
first came a stalled nuclear deal
later a needless spat over an indian diplomat in new york
india's disappointing growth meanwhile seemed to lead to declining interest
modi has now successfully hit the reset button
by not bearing a <unk> against washington for <unk> him and by <unk> american business with <unk> he has revived a <unk> partnership
americans who have negotiated with indian teams under modi say it's evident the new prime minister has been clear with his <unk>
it's time to fix things with washington
and so it comes down to modi and obama in new delhi
indian tv channels alternate between flashing banners saying <unk> obama one minute and asking about <unk> from the summit the next
for days teams in london have been hammering out a potential deal to trade civilian nuclear energy
there is talk of increased ties on defense and on renewable energy
climate change will be an important topic for both sides
india generates more than half its energy needs from the <unk> fuel in common use coal
and there will be much more soaring rhetoric
on a visit earlier this month u.s. secretary of state john kerry called for trade between the two countries to multiply five times
that will be <unk> for quite a while
it may be asking too much to judge the modi obama summit through <unk> alone
after all the invitation came just a couple of months ago when the two met in myanmar
symbolism has inherent value
by visiting india for a second time obama is putting new delhi on the map in washington
in india he will be seen by a generation of young indians on tv
they will glow with pride that the world's most powerful man has come to town once again
the real work between the two countries will continue at a smaller ongoing level
with increased people to people contact with more trade with more tourism with an energized indian <unk> in the united states and with many many more days of talks between the two countries <unk>
in many ways the people on both sides are ahead of policy
according to a pew research center survey last year fifty eight percents of indians view americans favorably with only eighteen percents holding an <unk> view
it's time for government to catch up
with both india and the united states benefiting from lower crude prices and a growth <unk> this is as good a time as any
the former <unk> league <unk> turned cubs legend turned favorite son of chicago died friday of a heart attack in the illinois city family attorney mark <unk> said
it was a week shy of his eighty four th birthday
a public memorial will be scheduled <unk> said
cubs chairman tom <unk> described banks as one of the greatest players of all time
words can not express how important ernie banks will always be to the chicago cubs the city of chicago and major league baseball <unk> said
he was a pioneer in the major leagues
and more importantly he was the warmest and most sincere person i've ever known
approachable ever optimistic and <unk> ernie banks is and always will be mr. cub
farewell to mr
cub ernie banks an elegant ambassador and all time great
the thing is banks wasn't just a great baseball player but a great champion for his sport and adopted city
the windy city's mayor rahm emanuel called him one of chicago's greatest ambassadors
emanuel said he loved this city as much as he loved and lived for the game of baseball
and baseball loved him back not just for the player he was but the man he was
this sentiment was evident on social media with one man writing i've heard a lot of ernie banks stories in my life a lot
but not one of them showed him in a negative way
one person tweeted that like the recently departed stan <unk> banks was never too big for fans
mr. cub will play two today wrote another man
he's with the angels now and hopefully he'll get a ring
that message alluded to the fact that banks despite all his stellar play over his career never earned a world series ring
in fact the last time the cubs won <unk> ultimate prize was one thousand nine hundred and eight
but you'd never know it from banks <unk> smile
he became the chicago <unk> first black player in one thousand nine hundred and fifty three
that happened three years after the dallas native started his professional career in the <unk> leagues with the kansas city monarchs then spent two years in the army
after the monarchs sold his contract to the cubs banks jumped straight to the major leagues <unk> hundred and fourteen in the ten games he played in that first season
he became chicago's starting <unk> the next year then had his real breakthrough in one thousand nine hundred and fifty five when he racked up one hundred and seventeen <unk>
his forty four home runs that season were at the time the most ever for a <unk>
banks kept it up as his career rolled along
late umpire tom gorman once recalled that in one thousand nine hundred and fifty seven <unk> don <unk> bob <unk> bob friend and jack sanford knocked down banks with pitches according to a story on the cubs website
and each time he was knocked down gorman said banks hit their next pitch out of the park
the accomplishments piled up through banks retirement after the one thousand nine hundred and seventy one season
two thousand five hundred and eighty three hits eleven national league all star selections two of the league's most valuable player awards and five hundred and twelve home runs including five seasons hitting more than forty <unk>
and in one thousand nine hundred and seventy seven six years after his last at bat banks was <unk> into the baseball hall of fame
it's no wonder then that he was voted the greatest cub ever in a one thousand nine hundred and sixty nine chicago sun times fan poll
after all he was known both as mr. cub and mr. sunshine
hall of fame manager leo <unk> who was known for saying nice guys finish last made an exception for banks
banks is one nice guy who finished first but he had the talent to go with it <unk> said
and this from <unk> arthur daley
he <unk> merely in living and baseball is a <unk> extra that makes his existence so much more <unk>
<unk> the family lawyer said that banks would go right up to people and ask about their families and how they were doing rather than baseball
he wanted to know all about people's lives
baseball was not the first thing he would talk about the attorney said
he cared about people
his work on and off the field led to his receiving the presidential medal of freedom the nation's highest civilian honor in two thousand and thirteen
to have this award passed on to me is certainly a great joy banks told cnn's jake tapper at the time
it's something i'll never forget
the <unk> left an impression on president barack obama and first lady michelle obama too
in a white house statement saturday obama noted how banks who made seven dollar a day coming up through the <unk> leagues never lost his cheer his optimism and his love of the game
he was beloved by baseball fans everywhere obama said including michelle who when she was a girl used to sit with her dad and watch him play on tv

the couple's lawyer david kennedy said <unk> and <unk> were very pleased with the court's ruling
we are happy for the tens of thousands of gay <unk> and their children kennedy said
justice and equality are guaranteed to everyone and we are proud to know that is true in alabama tonight
the state filed a motion friday seeking to put a hold on the judge's decision pending a ruling from the u.s. supreme court effectively trying to keep couples from applying for marriage licenses in the meantime
the supreme court has previously refused to hear cases from states indiana oklahoma and wisconsin to name a few seeking to keep their bans against same sex marriage in place
but the court is expected to consider petitions from lower courts in five states where judges upheld laws banning same sex marriage
if the ruling is upheld alabama would be the thirty seven th state to authorize same sex marriage

walmart and the mcnair family have worked closely together to reach an agreement
walmart continues to work with others involved in the accident and we will continue to do what's right
last june a <unk> bus carrying morgan mcnair and their companions was rear ended by a walmart truck on the new jersey <unk>
the crash killed mcnair and left morgan with a severe brain injury and their colleagues with other injuries
a preliminary report by the national transportation safety board said the walmart truck was traveling twenty mph over the speed limit and that its driver was almost at his drive time limit
in july four parties filed suit against walmart stating in a complaint that the defendants negligence was a substantial contributing factor in causing plaintiffs injuries
pamela mcnair said the family will continue carrying on james legacy as a humanitarian and the finances from the settlement will help
my brother has done a lot for the community
he mentored the youth for the community he worked at the homeless shelter
little things that he's done are truly missed mcnair said
he was a great comedian but he was a good family person first and foremost
he loved life and wanted others to love life as well
he was a humanitarian

it's kind of heartbreaking mcnair said
i understand he has his own medical situation i want the best for him i'm praying for his recovery but i felt that someone could have reached out to the family
my brother and tracy had a very long relationship as friends and it is heartbreaking we haven't heard from anyone
joseph sledge who was wrongfully convicted in one thousand nine hundred and seventy eight said he feels wonderful about his freedom

<unk> davis and her daughter <unk> davis were discovered in september one thousand nine hundred and seventy six inside their home in <unk> north carolina
the women had been beaten and stabbed multiple times
<unk> davis had been sexually assaulted
man freed by dna evidence after twenty years dies a year later
the day before the women's bodies were found sledge had escaped from white lake prison camp approximately four miles from the victims home
he had been serving a four year sentence for <unk>
sledge was picked up after he was spotted in <unk> south carolina driving a stolen car arrested and brought back to north carolina where he was charged with two counts of first degree murder in the deaths of the <unk>
at trial the state presented forensic evidence linking sledge to the crime
two inmates also testified against sledge saying he had admitted to the crimes behind bars
he was convicted and sentence to life in prison
during the more than three decades sledge was in prison he maintained his innocence filing numerous post conviction motions on various grounds
all were denied without hearing
in two thousand and three however his request for new dna testing was granted
testing began five years later
the north carolina innocence inquiry commission took on investigating <unk> case
it in december found sufficient evidence of <unk> innocence to merit judicial review
speaking to reporters outside the columbus county jail sledge said when you're conscious of something you didn't do you can live with yourself
it's between you and your maker
the family of <unk> and <unk> davis expressed their disapproval with the panel's decision
catherine brown <unk> davis <unk> reading from a prepared statement said we the family are heartbroken by this decision
sledge who was <unk> incarcerated for thirty seven years addressed the davis family directly saying i'm very very sorry for your loss
i hope you get closure in this matter

the annual january twenty six parade celebrates the day in one thousand nine hundred and fifty when a newly independent republic of india adopted its first constitution
it's india's <unk> moment of pride when <unk> <unk> all and the nation lays out its culture accomplishments and military might for the world to see
this year president barack obama will see the festivities firsthand
he's the first u.s. leader india has invited to be the guest of honor and the first president to visit india twice in his tenure
that's a sign i believe of how far india has come from the nation of my childhood
back then i stood in the crowd thinking of things i learned in school about india's rich history and valiant struggle for freedom from british <unk>
but it was impossible to forget i was born in the third world
signs of poverty and despair were everywhere
i often heard this refrain
the east shall rise again
but i held no expectations no hopes really that my homeland would ever be any different
not in my lifetime
but over the last two decades i have been going home to a radically transformed india one that has experienced immense economic growth and social change
now obama is making history with his trip
he'll stand with prime minister narendra modi on rajpath the grand avenue that leads to india gate <unk> version of the arc de triomphe
obama will also be meeting modi for the second time within the span of a few months
the two met at the white house at the end of september on modi's first trip as prime minister to the united states
all this indicates india's arrival on the global stage
rick rossow of the center for strategic and international studies put it this way
it's a big deal
there's no better way to put it
modi's invitation to obama say india experts is a simple but extremely important gesture that could jump start relations between the two countries
modi's a controversial figure
some blame him for doing nothing to stop a massacre of muslims in gujarat the western indian state where he was chief minister
but indians voted him into the highest office of the land in a roaring landslide victory
they were fed up with years of <unk> and government corruption and in modi they saw the man who can again make india prosper
south asia expert milan <unk> told me the white house has been waiting a long time to conduct business with india with confidence
in modi they believe they have found that elusive leader and they don't want to pass up the opportunity says <unk> of the carnegie endowment for international peace
both india and the united states want a strong economy and a strong defense
a good guess is that the leaders of the world's two largest democracies will talk trade and terrorism
they are also likely to take up the issue of chinese dominance
besides japan india is america's strongest ally on that matter
we really talk about it more as not a <unk> to china but you want a <unk> asian future says rossow of <unk>
you know you want multiple sources of power in any jurisdiction and we would love for india to be because of course we've got an alignment of values
that last point got me thinking about india's growing prominence and what the world might look like fifty years from now in terms of power
america may not be the sole <unk> anymore
and that refrain from my childhood could be ringing true after all
the east is rising
people in the west often talk about the emergence of india on the world stage
but that's because they don't know the history of my homeland
that for centuries india was one of the richest countries in the world until the british empire swallowed it up and left it <unk>
the british even stole the famous <unk> diamond and stuck it on the queen's crown
i recently read a story in the indian news magazine <unk> that mentioned a one thousand nine hundred and eighty three study of the world economy that created quite a stir among western economists
the study said that in one thousand seven hundred and fifty china owned thirty three percents of the global gdp and india twenty four point five percents
in the same year the combined share of britain and the united states was a mere two percents
a subsequent analysis found that india had the largest economy in the world for one thousand seven hundred of the past two thousand years
so to call india an emerging power is silly
if anything my homeland is re emerging as the global power it once was
india of course has a way to go to catch china although it has already <unk> japan as the third largest economy
opinion
why two thousand and fifteen will be a defining year for india
economic historian robert <unk> has predicted that by two thousand and forty the chinese economy will reach one hundred and twenty three dollar trillion
that's three times the economic output of the entire globe and quite staggering when you consider that china was considered a poor country in two thousand
<unk> thinks china's per capita income will hit eighty five thousand dollar more than double the forecast for the european union
china's gdp at forty percents will dwarf america's fourteen percents
but some economists think that india has a chance to leap over china in about fifty years
the most recent world bank forecast says growth in india is likely to <unk> china's
granted it's a prediction that has been made before and india has disappointed
but now with modi in the driver's seat many experts are hopeful that india can resolve problems of political <unk> and take off like it was supposed to have done a decade ago
india says rossow is destined to become another pole of power
india is a large country that will be population wise in the next twenty years probably surpassing china says rossow
economy wise it'll be a rival and growing quite heavily
that's why my city <unk> in atlanta <unk> hall is visiting india
<unk> he will be there at the same time as obama
i recently spoke with hall about why he is going on the state department sponsored trip
the geopolitics of the world and its economic focus has shifted and it will continue to shift east hall told me
india is a very significant player
hall of course is interested in strengthening indian business ties with the city of atlanta home to more than one hundred thousand south asian immigrants
he says he is impressed by the burgeoning middle class in india and by the fact that india is rooted in democracy unlike china
india has the advantage of <unk> its development says hall
indians are innovating above and beyond what was normal in the west and they have the advantage of learning from mistakes made by developed nations
they have a chance to address education poverty and heath care in a <unk> way says hall
<unk> emerging <unk> brings its people along the best will be the most dynamic
the human element is what people always leave out
obama says hall has every reason to reach out to modi a man who began as a <unk> <unk> a tea seller and became prime minister of india
that after all is the american dream realized in the land of my birth
i never bought a single item from the catalog myself
not the stay fresh <unk> drinking fountain that kept kitty happy and hydrated while you were in tibet
not the emergency evacuation smoke hood which looked like a cross between a one thousand nine hundred and fifty s <unk> training device and a children's toy sold by irwin <unk>
certainly not the fourteen <unk> gold cross <unk> with the two thousand year old <unk> <unk> coin embedded in it which back in the <unk> early two thousand s heyday sold for one hundred and ninety nine dollar point ninty five
perhaps i just don't travel in the right circles but outside the pages of that <unk> catalog i never set eyes on a single portable spa or robot lawn <unk> to say nothing of the sensible clothing luggage and household items that actually filled the bulk of its pages
that of course didn't stop me from <unk> the outsized pride of place skymall held inside the cabin of virtually every major u.s. commercial aircraft during its near twenty five year run in the skies
skymall wasn't just an annoying space eater in a seat back pocket <unk> between airline propaganda safety cards and <unk> bags it was the one reliable punch line during those <unk> delays on the tarmac the one thing the airlines offered us that could guarantee five solid minutes of entertainment the one thing in that stuffy cabin that wasn't quite so stuffy
from the amount of online tributes generated in the wake of the bankruptcy announcement from the catalog famous for hawking <unk> garden <unk> statues and other <unk> necessities you'd think skymall had been around forever
in fact we've only had airborne access to <unk> breeze personal air <unk> and <unk> tongue <unk> since one thousand nine hundred and ninety when a visionary american <unk> named robert <unk> launched the catalog that inadvertently kept millions of passengers entertained on those excruciating <unk> between san diego and <unk> and then around the world
skymall had a predecessor the <unk> catalog also featured quirky products no one would ever buy yet somehow apparently did but now we're being told the golden age of inflight shopping has been done in by the pressures of technology
according to the bankruptcy filing from skymall owner <unk> <unk> the <unk> of mobile devices and internet access on airplanes pretty much doomed the old <unk>
but as a convenient <unk> the internet is a lot like china these days and i'm not sure technology is the real culprit here
it's not like skymall was some <unk> dinosaur <unk> along <unk> unaware of the internet
in two thousand and nine <unk> website generated eighty point five million dollar in revenue making it one of the top two hundred e commerce websites in the world
add in about fifty million dollar in magazine revenues and the company was generating an estimated one hundred and thirty million dollar in revenue annually just half a decade ago
a two thousand and thirteen atlantic article cast heavy doubts on <unk> then recent merger with the phoenix based <unk> <unk> a company it said raises all sorts of red flags
the atlantic didn't see good things in <unk> future but that had nothing to do with a loss of public appetite for talking picture frames and replica one thousand nine hundred and fifty seven <unk> <unk> air <unk> with three point five <unk> gas engines that could safely transport a person weighing up to two hundred and fifty pounds
so maybe there was an element of mismanagement behind <unk> demise
this seems possible but i can't help thinking there's something even more insidious at work here maybe the death of the place where the world could always go to satisfy its impulses for <unk> ball <unk> for dogs and <unk> signifies the <unk> of something even <unk> our senses of humor
with air rage anxiety and traveler frustration at worrying levels across our increasingly tense skies maybe it was inevitable that those easy laughs and stolen moments of inflight <unk> would finally go the way of complimentary blankets pillows and cocktails
<unk> not as much fun as it used to be we all know that and with the passing of skymall it just got a little <unk>
<unk> skymall
whatever journey you're embarking on i'm pretty sure you're going to get there with a few more laughs than we will
the doomsday clock is a universally recognized indicator of the world's vulnerability to catastrophe from nuclear weapons climate change and other emerging global threats
although it may be easier to think out of sight out of mind the bulletin has been alerting us since one thousand nine hundred and forty seven that nuclear weapons remain a grave threat to the survival of humanity
the original setting was seven minutes to midnight and now we've allowed our world to drift to a setting of three minutes to midnight not seen since one thousand nine hundred and eighty four during one of the most dangerous periods of the cold war
there are still sixteen thousand three hundred nuclear weapons in the world many on high alert able to be launched in less than fifteen minutes
there can be no meaningful medical or humanitarian response to a nuclear attack whether it is planned or accidental
cheating scandals low morale and security lapses that put us all at risk have plagued america's nuclear military forces
according to eric <unk> author of command and control there were more than one thousand mishaps involving our nuclear arsenal from one thousand nine hundred and fifty one thousand nine hundred and sixty eight
and who knows what hair raising incidents have happened involving foreign <unk>
our nuclear security ought not to depend on good luck continuing indefinitely
the setting of the doomsday clock also addresses the vast scale of the danger
recent research published by physicians for social responsibility indicates that even a limited regional nuclear war say between india and pakistan would have profound health impacts on all of us
if one hundred hiroshima size weapons were used in such a war the climatic effects would have a devastating impact on world agriculture and put two billion people at risk of starving
it has become self evident that these weapons have no military utility and are too dangerous to keep around
we can change this
recently a dynamic worldwide movement of people and governments has shown a renewed interest in nuclear disarmament
in october one hundred and fifty five of the world's governments representing seventy nine percents of the nations of the world supported a u.n. resolution calling for the elimination of nuclear weapons
in a powerful personal message last month to the vienna conference on the humanitarian impact of nuclear weapons pope francis declared that nuclear weapons are a global problem affecting all nations and impacting future generations and the planet that is our home
a global ethic is needed if we are to reduce the nuclear threat and work towards nuclear disarmament
he went on to say i am convinced that the desire for peace and fraternity planted deep in the human heart will bear fruit in concrete ways to ensure that nuclear weapons are banned once and for all to the benefit of our common home
president barack obama promised to pursue a world free of nuclear weapons but his administration must not have gotten the memo
the current plan involves spending three hundred and fifty five billion dollar over the next ten years to maintain and modernize our nuclear arsenal and one dollar trillion over the next thirty years
this is an absurd waste of taxpayers dollars on weapons that must never be used
the time has come for the united states in words and deeds to support the global elimination of nuclear weapons
the <unk> of the clock was also influenced by the report that last year was the warmest ever recorded on earth
this underscores scientific warnings that the relentless warming of our planet poses profound long term risks to civilization and to the natural world
unless we change our behavior worsening climate change will continue to negatively affect public health from heat related disorders worsening respiratory problems such as allergies and asthma more infectious diseases crop failure from drought or flooding with resulting malnutrition to mental health disorders such as post traumatic stress disorder and depression
our political leaders have a moral obligation to our children grandchildren and future generations to leave them a planet free of nuclear weapons and a planet that is not damaged beyond repair by the ravages of climate change
to some on the left it <unk> an unjust war while paying homage to an unapologetic killer with a <unk> good versus evil view of the world
which is closer to the truth
neither say the movie's makers
in recent interviews eastwood <unk> jason hall and star bradley cooper have said they are dismayed by attempts to <unk> political <unk> to what they see as primarily a portrait of real life navy seal sniper chris kyle and the iraq war's impact on him
the movie certainly has nothing to do with any parties or anything eastwood told the toronto star
these <unk> who are professional soldiers navy personnel or what have you go in for a certain reason
and there's no political aspect there other than the fact that a lot of things happen in war zones
for me and for clint this movie was always a character study about what the plight is for a soldier
cooper told the daily beast
but i can't control how people are gon na use this movie as a tool or what they pick and choose
no he can't
ever since american sniper broke box office records with a stunning one hundred and seven million dollar last weekend everyone seems to have an opinion about it
pundits veterans and internet critics on all sides of the political spectrum have spent the past week <unk> over the film's one hundred and thirty two minutes and the memoir by kyle on which it's based in search of fodder for political arguments
there is nothing even close to moral <unk> in american sniper only the truth
that there is no <unk> between the <unk> who target the innocent and the american heroes who target those who target the innocent wrote john <unk> on breitbart dot com a right wing website which calls the movie a pro war on terror <unk>
eastwood
makes the moral stakes almost nonexistent countered david <unk> of new york magazine
the people kyle shoots always represent a savage despicable evil and the physical and mental cost to other americans just comes with the territory
it's a republican platform movie
many others from michael moore and seth rogen to sarah palin and kid rock have since piled on
a few people even took to twitter to say the film made them want to kill arabs and muslims
all the controversy is no doubt drawing more people to the movie
but american <unk> makers say many of these viewers are missing the point
people see the movie poster and it's got a guy and the american flag and they know clint eastwood the dirty harry guy and the republican convention guy directed it
so they think it's some <unk> thing <unk> hall told time dot com
i would challenge that in a big way he added
chris was a man who believed in something and who therefore was useful to a government that needed him to go to war
it cost him his physical health his mental health and almost cost him his family
sniper isn't the first artistic work to find itself claimed by both sides in our cultural and political wars
in one thousand nine hundred and eighty four bruce <unk> song born in the <unk> written from the point of view of a <unk> vietnam veteran in a dead end world found itself celebrated for its rousing chorus
during that year's presidential campaign no less a figure than ronald reagan praised the new jersey <unk> for his message of hope
i think people have a need to feel good about the country they live in he said in an interview at the time
but what's happening i think is that that need which is a good thing is getting manipulated and exploited
then there was oliver stone's wall street a film inspired by stone's father an <unk> broker much like the movie's lou <unk> played by hal <unk>
but the character from the movie who became celebrated was gordon <unk> an <unk> shark who famously declared <unk> for lack of a better word is good
<unk> became a model for a generation of aspiring masters of the universe
even today people hoping for the big kill keep <unk> quotes handy <unk> to live by
finally there's this land is your land woody <unk> famed folk song remembered by generations of schoolchildren as a <unk> to america's glory
it's that to be sure guthrie really does celebrate golden valleys and diamond deserts but the song was also a reaction to a song guthrie <unk>
irving <unk> god bless america particularly as sung by kate smith
guthrie made no secret of his <unk> in one rarely sung verse
in the shadow of the <unk> i saw my people by the relief office i seen my people as they stood there hungry i stood there asking is this land made for you and me
yes american sniper encourages audiences to root for kyle and his fellow soldiers as they respond in horror to nine eleven face dangerous insurgents who try to bomb them and track down one especially lethal enemy sniper
and yes it ends with real life two thousand and thirteen footage of thousands of americans lining highways waving flags as kyle's funeral procession goes by
but in subtle ways the movie's message and morality is not so black and white
one scene shows cooper as kyle expressing dismay that his first kill as a sniper is not of an enemy soldier but of a young boy holding a bomb
another scene shows a grieving mother at the funeral of her son an iraq veteran reading aloud a letter from him questioning the point of the war
by the time he returns from his fourth tour in iraq kyle has clearly lost his appetite for warfare
he is alienated and withdrawn from his wife
and as in his oscar winning <unk> hall and eastwood who has said he opposed the invasion of iraq seem less interested in <unk> the act of killing than in exploring the <unk> toll it takes on the men who do it
the cost is man the toll is man and it's this man and every other soldier that fights hall told variety
if we understand that maybe we won't be so <unk> into jumping into war
if there's a message in american sniper it may be that americans could do a better job of understanding what our veterans go through and of taking care of them when they return
then again maybe the message of american sniper is whatever you want it to be
it is one man's war not the nation's wrote scott beauchamp an iraq veteran in <unk>
while films have loud <unk> messages that allow us to confront the issues head on american sniper is sort of an empty <unk> waiting for us to project already existent emotions onto the screen
the announcement from house speaker john boehner's office this week came after several high level interactions between u.s. and israeli officials including a phone call between obama and netanyahu and a multi hour meeting between secretary of state john kerry and israeli ambassador ron dermer a senior administration official told cnn
netanyahu's snub has once again soured relations between the two world leaders but u.s. officials insist the tensions won't affect u.s. support for israel
the boehner announcement came just over a week after obama spoke over the phone with netanyahu and urged him not to lobby in favor of new iran sanctions asking for some space a senior administration official said
but the hawkish israeli prime minister has a track record of supporting tougher sanctions against iran and he's expected to make that case when he addresses congress in march
obama and other world leaders negotiating with iran over its nuclear program have firmly argued against a sanctions bill from congress which they say would unravel a delicate international coalition and tank negotiations
we asked the israelis in private and public to sit tight and the president made clear if a deal wasn't reached he would be the first in line advocating for more sanctions the official said
that's what makes netanyahu's decision to address congress a pretty big deal the official added
and just a day before boehner's announcement kerry met for several hours with dermer who reportedly coordinated the visit between republican congressional leadership and netanyahu
but still there was no word of a netanyahu visit to washington
is this a smart way for them to manage the relationship
a source close to kerry said
the bilateral relationship is <unk> but playing politics with that relationship could blunt secretary kerry's enthusiasm for being israel's primary defender
while u.s. and israeli officials insist publicly that the relationship has never been stronger and by most measures it remains very strong netanyahu's address to congress is just the latest in a string of diplomatic <unk> that each time have sunk relations between the two leaders and their staff to new lows
netanyahu's continued expansion of jewish settlements in east jerusalem has angered u.s. officials prompting one senior white house official to call <unk> a <unk> in an october article in the atlantic that brought private tensions to light
obama's phone call with netanyahu and kerry's meeting with dermer just before the announcement give the snub a more personal <unk>
kerry had made more than fifty calls in the <unk> month to world leaders on the hot topics of israeli palestinian relations such as palestinian attempts to gain statehood through international organizations the source said adding that kerry's patience is not infinite
the in your face move from netanyahu's camp comes at a time when israel needs american support on the international stage with palestinians making a full court press to obtain statehood unilaterally through international institutions
another senior u.s. official said the israeli breach of protocol and diplomatic courtesy takes a toll on u.s. officials working strenuously to support israel on the international stage
they come to us with a lot of requests but don't have the courtesy of telling us
that is what tipped it for us the official said
but again the core aspects of the relationship and commitment remain intact the official said
the snub may not sway the u.s.'s broad commitment to israel's security and to supporting israel in the international arena but netanyahu will feel the repercussions when he comes to washington in march without a ticket to the white house
the white house announced that obama won't meet with netanyahu during his visit because of the proximity to israeli elections
netanyahu will address congress just twelve days before the elections
he had asked to push back his visit by nearly a month
u.s. officials aren't the only ones taken aback
former israeli president <unk> peres while refusing to directly criticize netanyahu conceded there are rules and norms how two countries have to behave
in that case i think the rules created differences and all of us have to look including our prime minister to go back to the basic rules and respect peres said in an interview in davos switzerland on saturday
it would come as no surprise that netanyahu's opponents in the election are harsher
his former finance minister and current competitor in the march election yair lapid said saturday that netanyahu is destroying our strategic relations with the united states for an election speech
yet ahead of the elections netanyahu's visit may be a boon for him and his party in israel as he plays himself up as the best protector of israel's security of which a relationship with the united states is a key factor
is that the relationship they want to have
the senior administration official said
the last thing we want to do is hurt israel but if he is able to stiff the u.s. president like that and we still offer him a meeting that invites him and anyone else to do that over and over
but last weekend a day before he was supposed to testify in a major investigation he was found by his mother lying in a pool of blood in his buenos aires apartment
he had a bullet in his head
nisman an argentine prosecutor was determined to seek justice over his country's deadliest terrorist attack the one thousand nine hundred and ninety four bombing of a buenos aires jewish community center the argentine israelite mutual association or amia which left eighty five people dead and hundreds more injured
what the country needs now is an investigator such as nisman someone who will resist the pressure the threats and the <unk> of domestic politicians and international <unk>
unfortunately there are already signs that the quest to find the truth about how he died and about who might have killed him is becoming tangled in the same truth <unk> <unk> nisman sought to cut during the ten years he spent investigating the amia bombing
if argentina's prosecutors have nothing to hide they should reassure the world by inviting outside observers to verify that the process is moving forward according to international standards
yet government officials who have a clear conflict of interest are already acting <unk> reportedly showing up at the crime scene prematurely declaring the death a suicide and offering self serving theories of the case
the government's interest in nisman became sharply intense a few days before his death
on january fourteen nisman announced he had filed a criminal complaint accusing argentine president cristina fernandez de kirchner her foreign minister hector timerman and other prominent individuals of engaging in a conspiracy with iran to cover up tehran's role in orchestrating and financing the amia bombing
in an earlier indictment he had accused hezbollah and iran of carrying out the hit
nisman said he had multiple recordings of iranian officials boasting of their role in the attack which was also the deadliest on a jewish target since the holocaust
the indictment also accused iran of setting up a terrorist network in latin america with agents who execute terrorist attacks when the iranian regime decides so
whether directly or through its proxy the terrorist organization hezbollah
back in two thousand and seven an argentine judge had obtained interpol arrest warrants for five iranians including then defense minister ahmad vahidi and one lebanese man
but the case had stalled without cooperation from tehran
argentina had proven incapable of bringing anyone to justice and then president carlos <unk> was accused of receiving bribes to stop the prosecution
the late president <unk> kirchner whose widow is the current president called the impunity over amia a national <unk> when he appointed nisman in two thousand and four
but then in two thousand and thirteen fernandez announced a stunning move
argentina and iran had reached a deal to investigate the case jointly through a truth commission with no <unk> or enforcement powers
that seemed to be the final element in nisman's investigation pointing toward a conspiracy to <unk> iran from responsibility for a crime that he and his investigators were convinced iran had committed
as the investigation into nisman's death got underway security secretary sergio berni and <unk> fernandez secretary general to the presidency were quick to point to a possible suicide
but few seemed to agree and the evidence quickly undercut that theory there was no gunpowder residue on nisman's arm for example and he reportedly also left a note about groceries for his <unk>
attention is turning to why berni was one of the first people to turn up at nisman's apartment
meanwhile on thursday the president announced via twitter that she had changed her mind and that she now believes nisman did not commit suicide
her new theory though is very convenient for her government she suggests nisman may have been assassinated as part of a plot against her government
she also claims that nisman was <unk> to believe she had conspired to protect iran and hezbollah terrorists and that the plan was for him to accuse her publicly and then be killed to damage her
all this would seem even more <unk> if not for one bit of positive news for those hoping to see justice done nisman kept meticulous records which are now public
his two thousand and thirteen indictment for example describes in detail the meetings in which iran ordered the attack on the jewish center
and this tuesday the day after he was to report his findings to congress a judge released the new criminal complaint he had just filed
the two hundred and eighty nine page document asserts that the deliberate decision to cover up the perpetrators of iranian origin
was taken and implemented primarily by
he says the conclusions to be reached by the so called truth commission had already been drawn and vahidi would never be questioned
the president has for her part denied nisman's allegations
with mounting evidence of murder even berni now says it was not a suicide
the question then of course is who did it and whether argentina is capable of mounting a credible investigation
in recent years iranian and hezbollah agents have been <unk> in more than twenty terrorist plots around the world including in india <unk> kenya bulgaria and thailand
if nisman's killing is another in that list the world needs to know and the united states needs to know what iran has been involved in as it <unk> with the regime over its nuclear program
and finally if argentina's government is in some way involved it too must be held to account
more than twenty years after the massacre at amia the entire world must keep up the pressure to ensure the truth about what happened does not disappear with the death of alberto nisman
shannon maureen conley is one of the first americans to be sentenced for conspiracy to support isis and received a sentence that was also recommended by prosecutors seeking to send a message of <unk>
though the judge initially cited how conley needs psychiatric care he sided with prosecutors in the end
what is it that will cause others to stop in the future judge raymond p. moore said during sentencing
before sentencing conley wept as she read a statement saying it was after arrest that i learned the truth about the isis that i was taught to respect
she talked about her ongoing journey into islam
since my incarceration i have had a chance to read the entire quran she said
she concluded that the scholars she had been following in her online research about islam had distorted the quran she said
even though i was committed to the idea of jihad i didn't want to hurt anyone
it was all about defending muslims she said
she called her situation a life altering experience and said she now wants to be a catalyst of good going forward
i am deeply humbled by this opportunity to grow she said
i do not believe i am a threat to society and i ask you to allow me to prove it she pleaded to the judge
conley's mother waved to her with tears in her eyes as conley was led out of the courtroom
later her parents released a statement online criticizing the u.s. legal system for making an example of their daughter in trying to discourage others from turning to extremism
if the government is willing to sacrifice the future of a nineteen year old american citizen to drive the point home
then we feel the terrorists have won this particular battle in the war on terrorism
outside the courthouse after the proceeding conley's lawyer assistant federal defender robert <unk> told reporters he was disappointed with the sentence and noted that the plea agreement imposed limitations on any appeal which the defense is considering
i think the judge gave a sentence he thought was appropriate
that's all i really have to say about the sentence <unk> said
he said he wanted americans to know that his client is a wonderful person
her future will be bright
she will get past this he said
but moore said conley's plea agreement gave him limited options on sentencing
under the plea agreement conley faced up to five years in federal prison and a fine up to two hundred and fifty thousand dollar for conspiracy to provide material support to a designated foreign terrorist organization federal prosecutors said
she received credit for cooperating with federal authorities according to the prosecutor and the judge
her prison sentence will be followed by three years of supervised release and one hundred hours of community service in which she has to interact with ordinary people moore said
he also prohibited her possession of any black powder or explosive materials
i'm not taking any chances moore said
conley's plea was made last year in exchange for a reduced charge with a lighter sentence
during friday's sentencing hearing u.s. attorney greg <unk> said conley has been cooperative and willingly provided information to investigators
he argued that a four year sentence would send a message that the u.s. government uses restraint but consequences are serious in terror cases
moore interrupted the prosecutor at one point saying that woman is in need of psychiatric help
i'm not saying that her decisions were all a product of mental illness
but she's a bit of a mess moore said
the judge referenced conley's psychiatric report that stated she is not a terrorist
the judge also alluded to a series of events from two thousand and eleven to her arrest in two thousand and fourteen
there is a history of events that would make for a bad movie moore said
conley almost agreed to marry three different people in a matter of months according to moore
the prosecutor said conley was <unk> naive
added the judge
she has no history in the criminal justice system
she is very young
teenagers make dumb decisions a lot
conley looked relaxed in court
she smiled at times while talking with lawyers before the hearing
she wore a blue and white jail uniform a head scarf and glasses
<unk> said while conley has been in jail she has been studying spanish and <unk> writing letters to her mother sisters friends even allah talking about religion and her desire to understand
her lawyer said she has gone through a complete transformation in the past nine months
<unk> argued that the things that she believed at the time she was arrested she does not believe now
he noted that conley a convert to islam changed her adopted muslim name from <unk> to <unk> because she is a different person now
<unk> means female servant of allah
conley initially took the name <unk> after converting to islam
but moore adamantly responded she had another name before <unk>
don't tell me that changing her name means she gets it
she changes her name like i change my socks the judge told the defense
the judge said a belief even if she was misled by ill intentioned extremists asserting religion justifies violent jihad does not excuse her actions
there is a string of defiance that rolls through her life that i have not seen change yet moore said
defiance has been a part of the fabric for a long time and that is concerning
the judge talked about how she showed up to a meeting with the fbi wearing a t shirt that said sniper don't run you'll die trying
the judge also mentioned how investigators tried to stop conley with multiple warnings that following through on her plans could lead to her arrest
she responded with i'd rather go to prison than do nothing according to moore
the judge also expressed alarm about conley's other <unk>
what am i to do about this obsession with the military
moore said
he said conley planned to be a police officer and join the military and then went to training with u.s. army explorers to learn military skills
what if one reason she desired to go to syria to marry an isis fighter wasn't just because she shared a belief in jihad but because he was attractive to her because he was a soldier
the judge asked
the judge noted that conley still signs letters behind enemy lines
a female imam went to mentor conley in jail and reported that conley wanted to talk about violent jihad
the judge said it's surprising that conley suddenly is <unk> jihad and that she has seemed to do a one hundred and eighty degree turn in a very short period
the judge also brought up a letter conley wrote to a friend that seemed to mock the american people's concern about terrorism
moore also referenced comments that conley made to cnn when it visited her a day before friday's sentencing
conley told cnn of her new adopted muslim name a new <unk> for the sentencing date and how i'm in a vulnerable place right now and it would be stupid of me to talk to you when i'm vulnerable
on friday moore noted that she doesn't get it
she's a look at me girl moore continued and he referenced the cnn interview
<unk> said he was furious about the <unk> visit and said he thought it was sneaky
the judge also cited the isis fighter whom she was to marry <unk> <unk> a thirty two year old tunisian man
why did she think <unk> was a good man
does she get this
the judge said
he indicated that conley still calls her <unk> a good man
conley attracted national attention last year after authorities arrested her at denver international airport
investigators said she told them she was going to turkey to await word from an isis member in syria a man she met on the internet and planned to marry
according to court documents she intended to become a nurse in an isis camp
she is a colorado certified nurse's aide
her parents ana maria and john conley were aware of their daughter's conversion to islam but didn't know about her interest in extreme islam or jihad
john conley reportedly caught his daughter talking to her isis <unk> on skype
the couple asked for the father's blessing but he said no
on april one the father called the fbi to report that he had found her ticket for an april eight flight to turkey on his desk
that's pretty much what new england patriots quarterback tom brady and his coach bill belichick would have us believe after their less than <unk> press conferences yesterday
both men claimed they were just as <unk> as us over how exactly eleven out of twelve of the team's footballs used afc championship game against indianapolis had been illegally deflated below regulation specs
when i came in monday morning i was shocked to learn of the news reports about the footballs
i had no knowledge whatsoever of the situation said a famously <unk> belichick
i was completely totally unaware of anything
his quarterback appearing equally <unk> wanted everyone to know that he's no <unk>
i would never do anything to break the rules
i believe in fair play
i have no knowledge of anything
no knowledge of any wrongdoing
i don't know what happened
really tom
it's hard to believe almost <unk> really that brady who is in his fifteen th nfl season with six trips to the super bowl and three super bowl wins noticed nothing wrong
this is a guy who's known to <unk> every aspect of the game including the ball
and he's on record saying he prefers a soft football
how could a pro like this notice nothing wrong
the nfl which according to espn reports had been put on notice by the colts going into the afc championship game that the patriots may have used soft balls earlier in the season said it is conducting a full investigation but with the super bowl less than two weeks away we've heard nothing from them nor apparently has brady he said yesterday
so it's easy to understand why fans and even pro athletes are not buying <unk> story
it's obvious that tom brady had something to do with this said hall of fame <unk> <unk> <unk> on his dallas radio program even before the brady belichick press conferences
so for the balls to be deflated that doesn't happen unless the quarterback wants that to happen i can assure you of that
now the question becomes
did bill belichick know about it
the evidence is clear
eleven of the team's balls were illegally deflated and they didn't get there by themselves
all the talk about cold weather being the culprit
forget it
not only was the temperature in the fifty s on game day but if weather was a factor then the colts game balls would have also deflated
that didn't happen
brady always the polished <unk> is playing the innocent victim role perfectly
perhaps this is all just a conspiracy put out there by patriots <unk> brady suggested yesterday
good try but most reasonable people do not believe in conspiracy theories
and hopefully even fewer people believe in invisible <unk>
so there must be another explanation
that leaves the deflategate spectacle in the hands of nfl commissioner roger goodell
the scandal has provided plenty of jokes for late night television and twitter
but cheating in the nfl a nine point five billion dollar a year industry with an overall market value of forty six billion dollar for its thirty two teams is no laughing matter
it's been a rough year for the integrity of the game
goodell has admittedly made botched calls over several cases involving domestic abuse with the ray rice scandal being the most egregious
and this season has been littered with <unk> play calling in crucial game situations
this is no time for stalled investigations
a ruling on deflategate after the super bowl would be a huge <unk> and signal that cheating no matter how blatant is no big deal in the nfl
goodell should act swiftly and announce sanctions against new england before the super bowl takes place in phoenix on <unk> one
fans are not the only ones calling for the commissioner to clean this mess up
earlier this week nevada sen. dean <unk> called on goodell to restore the credibility of the game
i am seeking decisive actions ensuring all teams are playing according to the rules <unk> said in a statement
he recommended the league work with the nfl players association to resolve the issue ahead before the super bowl
let's be clear
the patriots are second time offenders when it comes to cheating
back in two thousand and seven belichick was fined the nfl maximum of five hundred thousand dollar and the patriots were ordered to pay two hundred and fifty thousand dollar for spying on an <unk> defensive signals
in the end the team's assistant video guy took the fall and was the only person fired in the incident
the pats also lost a draft pick in two thousand and eight
this episode represents a calculated and deliberate attempt to avoid long standing rules designed to encourage fair play and promote honest competition on the playing field goodell said at the time in a letter to the patriots
goodell got it right back then
he handed out the biggest fine ever for an nfl coach and he sent a clear message that cheating would not be tolerated or <unk> away
this time around despite the billions of dollars attached to the super bowl goodell needs to go further
at a minimum the commissioner should
<unk> the patriots from the super bowl
fine or suspend belichick who despite his claims to the contrary should have known about the deflated balls and even if he didn't he's ultimately responsible for everything that happens on the field
and if it can reasonably be argued that brady knew or should have known based on his nfl expertise that the football has been <unk> with then he too should face tough sanctions
since there's no precedent for <unk> a super bowl team goodell would have to put a plan in place
it makes sense to me that the next best afc team would go instead of the pats which means the colts would play
and no it doesn't matter that new england beat <unk> forty five seven
the score is not the point when a team cheats
and if winning by any means necessary is really all that matters these days in the nfl then we might as well throw out the rule books and stop <unk> about the <unk> of the game
it's two thousand and fifteen and it seems the patriots still think the rules don't apply to them
they haven't learned their lesson
this time around the commissioner must send an even stronger message so there's no confusion
the patriots should be <unk> for super bowl xlix
the league said the super bowl bound new england patriots used footballs that didn't meet league <unk> in the first half of the afc championship game last sunday
while the evidence thus far supports the conclusion that footballs that were under inflated were used by the patriots in the first half the footballs were properly inflated for the second half and confirmed at the conclusion of the game to have remained properly inflated the nfl's statement said
the statement said the nfl wants to know specifically whether any <unk> was the result of deliberate action
we have not made any judgments on these points and will not do so until we have concluded our investigation and considered all of the relevant evidence
forty interviews have been conducted the nfl said but it didn't say whether investigators had talked to star quarterback tom brady or coach bill belichick
brady the central figure in the controversy said thursday that nobody from the nfl had talked to him
he and the coach said they don't know how the balls became under inflated
patriots chairman and ceo robert kraft said the nfl spent three days talking to patriots employees but he didn't specify whether brady or belichick were interviewed
during the three days they were here we provided access to every full and part time employee the league's representatives requested to speak with and produced every communication device that they requested to search kraft said in a statement his first about the the flap dubbed deflategate
what the heck is deflategate
eleven of the twelve game balls the patriots provided were under inflated by about two pounds per square inch each espn reported
regulation pressure is twelve point five thirteen point five psi
a ball with lower inflation is supposedly easier to grip and may give the <unk> a competitive advantage
nfl executive vice president jeff <unk> and ted wells of the law firm paul weiss are leading the investigation the statement said and renaissance associates an investigatory firm has been hired to assist in reviewing electronic and video information
the investigation started promptly on sunday night the statement said and so far has included forty interviews with patriots personnel game officials and third parties with relevant information and expertise
the inquiry started after indianapolis colts linebacker <unk> jackson intercepted a brady pass in the first half
the patriots beat the colts forty five seven
according to <unk> he took the ball to his team's equipment staff which then informed head coach chuck <unk> who told general manager ryan <unk> who told nfl director of football operations mike <unk> who told the officials on the field
however on thursday at pro bowl practice jackson said he didn't say he thought the ball was flat
i made a great play on a great player and i wanted to keep it as a <unk> jackson said in an interview with cnn affiliate <unk>
so i handed it off
the next thing i know i'm in the middle of deflategate so i don't know how that happened and i was just doing my job and i seem to be in the middle of everything
but i've got a ton of respect for that organization new england
they outright beat us hands down and that's pretty much all i can say about it
the patriots will face the seattle seahawks in super bowl xlix on february one in phoenix arizona
opinion
throw the patriots out of the super bowl
u.s. military leadership has held open the possibility it would recommend moving advisers closer to combat lines
as the key mosul battle looms that remains a potential consideration if and when they believe it's necessary a senior u.s. military official tells cnn
the possible recommendation would need to be approved by president barack obama who has said that u.s. troops will not be sent on a combat mission
but putting advisers with front line iraqi troops puts american troops in close range of what is likely to be an intense battle with the terror group
gen. martin dempsey chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and gen. lloyd austin head of u.s. central command would make that recommendation to obama if they determine iraqis need u.s. help and there is no other option for providing it
the official declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the situation but has direct knowledge of both generals thinking
the generals want to wait as long as possible to decide whether moving american ground troops closer to the front lines is necessary
their hope is that iraq will be able to field more experienced units perhaps as soon as this spring that can begin the mosul assault the official told cnn
right now the most experienced and loyal iraqi units are protecting baghdad
the iraqis may need to be convinced to move them into the mosul operation and <unk> with other units
<unk> mosul from isis is considered one of the most important objectives of iraq forces
this month coalition airstrikes have stepped up around mosul in an effort to cut key isis supply lines into the city as an opening move to a future assault
the u.s. military assessment is the <unk> the assault could begin is spring
the anatomy of isis
how it is run
obama has been adamant that no u.s. troops will be put into direct ground combat in iraq
in a speech to troops in september obama said the american forces that have been deployed to iraq do not and will not have a combat mission
they will support iraqi forces on the ground as they fight for their own country against these terrorists
u.s. officials say six thousand isis fighters killed in battles
what dempsey and austin are holding open is the possibility of a small number of u.s. military troops working as advisers alongside iraqi units involved in the upcoming mosul assault in a front line combat situation
those troops could potentially also work on the ground to help iraq units pick out targets to strike if a recommendation is made and the mission approved
in september dempsey said he believed u.s. advisers on the front lines would not be needed
but if it fails to be true and if there are threats to the united states then i of course would go back to the president and make a recommendation that may include the use of u.s. military ground forces
in recent weeks advisers have gone out in the field
what's happening in the middle east and why it matters
dempsey for now is strongly focusing on the pace of the iraqi government meetings its goals first according to the official
he still wants to see more progress on iraq forming a unity government proceeding with reconstruction goals and countering isis propaganda the official said
if we offer too much before iraqis are ready we are just painting over the rust the official said
recent comments by prime minister haider al abadi that the coalition wasn't doing enough to support iraq only reinforced <unk> view the official said
and even working as advisers is risky for troops
canadian forces in the field recently had to return fire when they came under attack during an advisory mission
as for isis's current strength the u.s. military assessment continues to be their momentum has been somewhat stalled in iraq and territory gains in syria are stagnant the official said
the united states also believes isis is stepping up its terror tactics in both areas including forcing people to fight because they are having trouble recruiting and paying new fighters the official said

after the <unk> of conceding a last minute winner against senegal in its opener <unk> has followed with the black stars stealing all three points at the death in their second group c match against tournament favorite algeria
following ninety one minutes of a game of football that had very little to show for it <unk> <unk> back for ghana after a bout of malaria was on hand to keep his nation's dream of a first africa cup of nations title in thirty three years alive
despite a poor showing but for a handful of minutes at this tournament <unk> <unk> men will take heart from beating the <unk> highest ranked team the last time it defeated algeria in the africa cup of nations it went on to win the whole thing in one thousand nine hundred and eighty two
the result means ghana is now level on points with algeria but <unk> the north african nation into group <unk> second qualifying spot due to its superior head to head record
the day's late game between south africa and senegal ended one one leaving group c very tight south africa sit top one point ahead of ghana and algeria with bottom placed south africa a further two points <unk>
ghana's chances of a victory against algeria did not look quite so bright at halftime however following a <unk> <unk> forty five minutes <unk> of any real quality with the black stars desperate not to lose and the desert <unk> happy with a draw
given that it was pretty much a must not lose affair for ghana in <unk> equatorial guinea <unk> nerves were perhaps to be expected
and they certainly had their <unk> way in the first half with a poor touch from <unk> <unk> in ghana's goal almost handing <unk> <unk> the opener on a plate only for the keeper to recover in time
algeria equally struggled to make an impact lacking the enthusiasm going forward it showed in last summer's world cup though it did come closest to scoring in a <unk> first half through <unk> <unk> who fired wide an <unk> <unk> delivery
ghana appeared a somewhat different team after the break perhaps realizing that three points might be vital towards ensuring a first africa cup of nations group stage exit since two thousand and six is avoided
<unk> first went close heading an <unk> <unk> cross <unk> wide while andre <unk> and jordan <unk> also had chances the older sibling heading over after his younger brother had earlier fired a <unk> effort off target
inspired by its opponent algeria also picked up its performance going forward resulting in a rather more open second forty five minutes
one constant from the first half however remained a lack of quality in the final third
that was until a shattered <unk> latched onto a long ball forward over the top deep into stoppage time and picked out the bottom corner
<unk> is a great player with a fantastic attitude
he was ill but he played the ninety minutes and scored at the end grant told fifa's official website following his first competitive win as ghana coach
he is a great player but also a great personality
but it's not just the victory of one player
it's the victory of a whole team
the second match at <unk> de <unk> saw south africa and senegal play out a far more entertaining affair with the second half coming alive after an <unk> opening forty five minutes
although eventually <unk> to a three one defeat against algeria monday it was south africa that started the brighter and took the lead on that occasion and it was similar for the bafana bafana this time around
the one thousand nine hundred and ninety six champion was the more threatening team in the first half and came out of the blocks firing after the restart as <unk> <unk> converted a cross from the right into the bottom corner of the net with an excellent first time finish
senegal <unk> in attack up to that point was soon <unk> and thought it had found an equalizer through <unk> <unk> shortly after only for the goal to be <unk> due to <unk>
minutes later though and the lions of <unk> had leveled with kara <unk> rising highest to head home <unk> <unk> free kick past the stranded jackson <unk>
with momentum on its side it was senegal who looked the more likely to score another attempting to replicate monday's comeback victory over ghana
this time however there was to be no last minute winner for alain <unk> side yet it still had the <unk> of ending the evening sitting atop group c
president abdu rabu mansour hadi's resignation thursday came after houthi rebels kidnapped his chief of staff seized control of key government buildings in the capital sanaa and failed to abide by provisions of a tentative peace deal hammered out wednesday
the chaos in yemen is cause for concern far beyond the country's borders
for the united states and its allies yemen's government has been a key ally in the fight against al qaeda in the arabian peninsula the yemen based group linked to attacks such as the recent slaughter at french magazine charlie hebdo
for the moment uncertainty rules
beyond it <unk> the prospect of a political vacuum and growing sectarian rift that terror groups such as aqap could exploit
<unk> al rowas a senior analyst at ihs country risk told cnn that unless hadi is <unk> the chances of the country avoiding armed conflict are slim
our forecast is really civil war in yemen because we have a lot of <unk> armed groups who are likely to compete over territory and have a lot of competing agendas she said
who is in charge right now really depends on where in yemen you are she said
the houthis shiite muslims who have long felt marginalized in the majority sunni country have taken control of sanaa and the northern provinces of <unk> and <unk>
but there has already been resistance to their attempted takeover of national government institutions from different groups in yemen particularly in the south where there's a long running <unk> movement and in the oil rich province of marib to the east of sanaa
this really creates a situation where even if the houthis keep control over sanaa they have little chance of taking control of the whole country said al rowas
we expect to see armed resistance
it's possible that hadi himself a <unk> could <unk> his resignation and put a gulf cooperation council initiative for a negotiated transition of power back on track
but that seems unlikely at present
according to the national news agency <unk> yemen's parliament is due to hold an extraordinary session sunday called by parliament speaker <unk> al <unk>
analysts suggest that because there's no vice president the speaker could be next in the line of succession taking on the role of acting president
he's close to former president ali abdullah saleh who <unk> to power until being forced out by international pressure two years ago
despite their takeover of sanaa it's unclear whether the houthis really want to take charge of the country
the group more likely wanted hadi to remain in power as a <unk> behind whom they could pull the strings without having to take on the <unk> business of governance said al rowas
under wednesday's failed peace deal the hadi government had agreed to rewrite parts of the country's constitution to give the houthis more political power in return for them withdrawing their militias from key government institutions and freeing the president's kidnapped aide
the government only finally got parliamentary approval in december said u.s. based yemen analyst <unk> al <unk>
hadi's resignation seems to be a recognition of the fact that he won't be able to lead the country as he wishes because of the houthi takeover she said
the houthis are shiites from northern yemen who make up about thirty percents of the population
they've been at war with the central government for the best part of a decade and are also fighting the sunni aqap
at the beginning of two thousand and fourteen they won a series of battles close to the saudi border
and in september houthi fighters suddenly descended on sanaa where they took over government buildings the main airport and a share of power
in the past week they've taken it to another level
although they have been fighting aqap they are no friend to the united states
one of the main slogans of this historically iranian backed group is death to america
the houthis have more recently forged an alliance with supporters of former president saleh said al rowas
this facilitated the houthis <unk> expansion but the alliance is fragile she said not least because saleh in the past waged military campaigns against the houthis
al qaeda's yemen affiliate aqap is perhaps the best known group internationally
it first emerged in saudi arabia in two thousand and two but thanks to the efforts of saudi authorities was a mostly a spent force by two thousand and five according to analysis from jane's world insurgency and terrorism
it re emerged <unk> in yemen in two thousand and nine after the saudi outfit merged with a yemeni al qaeda counterpart
besides battling the yemeni government and houthis it has been involved in international terror attacks including the failed two thousand and nine attempt to bring down an airliner over detroit
the muslim brotherhood is also a powerful group in yemen in the shape of the al <unk> party and is well represented in the <unk> government
it <unk> the houthis and has its own militias
the fighting in yemen also provides an opening to isis which is keen to <unk> al qaeda and prove itself the true defender of the faith
in november isis leader abu bakr al baghdadi called on yemeni sunnis to resist the houthis
there are also a number of heavily armed rural tribes that will fight for control over their territories
while in power hadi and the government of prime minister khaled bahah have been trying to fight aqap on the ground and also have authorized u.s. drone strikes in the country against terror targets
as part of those efforts the united states has several hundred american diplomats and military personnel in yemen
but the u.s. embassy has been on reduced staffing since september
the houthis have publicly said they oppose u.s. drone strikes and u.s. involvement in yemen
there are currently no talks with the houthis but there are discussions about whether to talk to them according to u.s. officials
multiple policy options are being considered the officials said though there is no consensus yet about how to proceed
the safety and security of u.s. personnel is our top priority in yemen u.s. state department spokeswoman jen psaki said
we are evaluating the security situation on the ground on an ongoing basis
we call on all parties to abide by their public commitments to ensure the security of the diplomatic community including our personnel
al <unk> the yemen analyst said she didn't see an immediate need to pull u.s. personnel out of yemen
i think yemen is safe at the time being she told cnn's wolf blitzer
the houthis have been in charge for a while
they have popular committees all over the capital of sanaa and they've been running the security show
i do however want to say that the americans might need to start talking to the houthis
and if the americans are talking to iran in back channels they need to do the same with the houthis
since hadi's resignation there has been a lot of anger against the houthis in parts of the country said al rowas the ihs country risk analyst
while hadi wasn't able to <unk> the country while in power she said since the houthi takeover of sanaa he has become the popular symbol of anti houthi sentiment across southern and central yemen
many there are calling for his return she said
a chief flashpoint for popular anger may be the central marib province she said
there have already been some low level confrontations and tribes are mobilizing in the area
large scale protests have also been seen in aden the main <unk> in the country's south where the current chaos plays into the hands of the <unk> movement
seven things to know about yemen
but diarra raised by immigrants from mali in the paris suburb of viry chatillon says it's as if her neighborhood is stamped across her forehead
it's hard to dream when everyone says the place you come from only <unk> jihadists terrorists and <unk> the twenty one year old says
you end up feeling completely isolated
viry chatillon is just one of the many banlieues heavily immigrant working class suburbs dotted around the <unk> of the french capital
but its close proximity to grigny has made the neighborhood synonymous with violence and failure
grigny is the hometown of amedy coulibaly who killed a policewoman as well as four hostages at a kosher supermarket in paris two weeks ago
his associates said and cherif kouachi slaughtered twelve more at the office of the satirical magazine charlie hebdo
together they are the worst terror attacks in france in decades
<unk> concerns were exacerbated this week when french prime minister manuel valls declared that there was a geographic social and ethnic apartheid that had developed in france
she believes the use of provocative language only further <unk> the people living in the banlieues
diarra says that the past two weeks have attracted a relentless and unwelcome media spotlight on viry chatillon with journalists descending en <unk> and filming from their cars for fear of being assaulted or having their equipment stolen
the negative press has <unk> up many <unk> and cultural stereotypes that diarra has spent most of her young life fighting to dispel ever since the two thousand and five riots that left thousands of cars burnt in the paris region thousands arrested and millions more traumatized across france
yes we need better education and yes delinquency exists in these towns but the government <unk> us all with the same brush
you stop feeling like an individual and begin to think you're reduced to a crime ridden town diarra says
diarra believes the media <unk> certain <unk> about towns like hers especially the one about how banlieues are full of bad apples
it's a sentiment shared by coulibaly's sister <unk> coulibaly now a successful dancer who reflected on the two thousand and five riots in a two thousand and nine interview with the san francisco chronicle
when you are in the projects they want you to shut your mouth to stay here to grow up complacent
for me the way that people in the projects are portrayed so negatively in the media really hurt me a lot <unk> told the paper
but <unk> rio the mayor of grigny is trying to shatter this image of banlieues as crime wracked ghettos
rio grew up in the concrete maze that is the grande borne the same housing project as coulibaly
rio says it's easy to overlook the success stories of the banlieues in favor of tales of homegrown terrorists but that not everyone from his town is a criminal
grigny was home to a professional football player an actress even a <unk> chef who now works in hong kong he says
these are all very successful people
in the same breath the mayor admits that his town faces grave economic problems
forty percent of grande borne residents aged sixteen twenty five are unemployed
the average net annual income in grigny is nine thousand six hundred euros according to rio the lowest in the paris region
these factors make it very difficult for those who live in the area to feel like they're part of society the mayor says
rio has been waging a campaign to get a fully staffed police station for the town's thirty thousand inhabitants
but the interior ministry has yet to grant his wish
the mayor also believes that better education will help bridge the gap between the banlieues and the state the us and them mentality
eric <unk> a schoolteacher in the eastern parisian suburb of <unk> <unk> <unk> has a class largely made up of second and third generation immigrant children
a man with a calm demeanor he believes opening a dialogue with his students on the theme of identity in france is crucial to helping his students find their place within the state
his main worry is what happens when they leave school and begin job hunting
because they struggle to find a job they feel <unk> <unk> and suddenly these young adults can't find their role in the workplace and therefore they create their own communities he says
de charles <unk> aka was amedy coulibaly's social worker
his small office in grande borne is littered with photos of smiling children that he has helped guide into adulthood
aka believes one of the reasons coulibaly might have formed a relationship with hardened criminals when he was in jail was because he didn't fit into life outside the prison walls despite desperately wanting to be part of a community
coulibaly had a big problem with identity he was lost
and prison offered him some bad examples to follow aka says
coulibaly's cousin <unk> agrees
he <unk> a bunch of idiots and became himself an idiot <unk> told french radio <unk>
he did not hate jews christians it's the state he hated
connecting the disaffected youth to the state through job creation is what <unk> el jarroudi has dedicated the last six years to
the business he founded the agency for diversity in entrepreneurship <unk> to reveal the untapped potential of doing business with <unk> entrepreneurs in marginalized neighborhoods
el jarroudi says the negative publicity surrounding the banlieues means companies shy away from recruiting there and in turn this further <unk> the people of these towns
we feel like we're alone and when we talk about the banlieues we only talk about its problems and never about the opportunity the banlieues represent today el jarroudi says
that is crucial to bringing everyone together
in the meantime <unk> diarra is hoping opportunity will come knocking as she <unk> an <unk> this summer
her dream is a career in journalism but she knows that ambition alone may not be enough
to have a future you need to believe in yourself but you also need others to believe in you she says

like any budding skier daniel <unk> had always dreamed of <unk> at the foot of austria's <unk> mountain but instead six years ago he lay face down on the snow out cold within meters of the finish line
online footage of the crash memorable to everyone except <unk> who can not remember anything from the day before the incident to three weeks hence is not for the faint hearted
at the time he had been the rising star of swiss skiing with four world cup wins to his name and a solitary world title the two thousand and seven super combined
on a training run with the finish line in sight he approached the final jump
a minor error on his part exacerbated by the fact he was traveling at one hundred and forty kph saw his <unk> flap wildly out of control as he battled to regain his balance for forty meters in the air before landing heavily on his back
<unk> suffered a brain injury and a <unk> lung was <unk> to hospital and placed in a coma for three weeks to give both his brain and lung the best chance of recovery
it was a hard time he recalls
you have to learn your name your age all this stuff
his first memory was of a hospital ceiling and it was three weeks after regaining consciousness that he once again remembered his name and the fact he had been a top skier
the last memory i have is from the day before
the feeling was great because the slope was in good shape and i was fast in first training and i was skiing easily
i knew that i was going to be fast in this race
then yeah it was too fast
<unk> is able to laugh as he <unk> the incident in part helped by the fact he has no recall of the savage beating he took on the final meters of the <unk> course even after watching it back on a few occasions
to him it is as though he is watching someone else's dramatic and sudden alpine downfall and without emotion
if i watch myself in <unk> then i feel like it wasn't me because i don't have any memory of him
i know that he was me i see that it was me but for me it was not a person
i was out of my body
in the early weeks of his recovery from his brain trauma he did not have the strength to even feed himself
however slowly but surely he got up to speed although he admits i have something his brain that doesn't work so good like before
so i'm always in recovery
today he gets tired quicker and his <unk> <unk> more readily than prior to the accident
but remarkably it did not end his career rather it was a <unk> left <unk> after crashing in another training run at lake louise canada in november two thousand and twelve that finally called time on his professional career on the slopes
amazingly it was just a week after being released from the neurological unit that cared for him that he was back skiing despite the inherent dangers of the sport
the first time i was on <unk> i thought okay <unk> this is a nice feeling i wan na go back in the world cup he recalls
i got down okay the first time but it was not so easy because then when i see i have to make a turn and then the brain had to tell the knee what to do
everything was in slow motion
slow as the process may have seemed initially within two years he was back on the world cup circuit although not quite the same force he previously was
there were to be no further world cup wins not that he minded enormously
he still recalls the feeling of being in the start gate for that first race back
it was a great feeling
i was a bit nervous
then i told me okay it's the first race just ski easily
then it was so good the feeling was so great and i was also fast
on his return to the sport the doctors had warned him he might suffer headaches at altitude
he never did
he was also warned about the perilous nature of another knock to the head
skiing is dangerous and it's always going to be in a little way dangerous
but if you are a skier if you are a pro if you're the downhill it's not so dangerous because you know what you can do you know how it works and for us <unk> when you ski it's easy
<unk> his family his wife in particular of that fact was the harder part but in the end they knew they could not stand in the way of his desire and the thing that made him tick as a human being
the return was relatively short lived his knee putting pay to his ambitions to once more get to the very top of the sport
having his career cut short was hard
my body told me that no it's over now
you came back you were in the world cup again you did it you have you're whole life in front of you
now he runs his own clothes line albright and also mentors young <unk> giving the thirty year old a new career in the sport
part of him the <unk> within would like to be in that start gate to tackle the slope on which he was lucky to survive
but he's just happy to have had a second chance at life

cuban diplomats announced in a statement thursday that in discussions with american officials they expressed their serious concerns over human rights in the united states citing everything from detentions at guantanamo bay to police abuse in ferguson and new york to racial and gender <unk>
the <unk> comes just before <unk> jacobson the head of the u.s. delegation was set to meet friday morning with the ladies in white the wives and other female relatives of cuban political prisoners and other dissident groups
cuban officials also suggested building up on the positive experience achieved in cuba with regard to the enjoyment of human rights and pointed to cuba's efforts to improve human rights in the world
cuba is known to be among the world's worst human rights offenders frequently jailing political dissidents and restricting freedom of expression according to human rights watch
the cuban government continues to <unk> individuals and groups who criticize the government or call for basic human rights
officials employ a range of tactics to punish dissent and instill fear in the public including beatings public acts of shaming termination of employment and threats of long term imprisonment human rights watch wrote about cuba in its two thousand and fourteen report
the cuban officials said they relayed their concerns to american diplomats about the alarming cases of brutality and police abuse in the united states which show the worsening of racism and racial discrimination according to the cuban statement

at least that's what a new app called am i going down
says
that means if you take that flight every day for the next eleven thousand one hundred and forty six years you'll be unlikely to experience an incident
created by london based company <unk> pixel the app uses real flight statistics to analyze flight safety
developer <unk> johns says it's geared toward those who are uneasy about air travel
the initial inspiration comes from my co founder and wife julie who for many years has suffered from a fear of flying says johns
in developing am i going down
i wanted to present the fact that the vast majority of flights are incredibly low risk
our app is meant as tool to help reassure fearful fliers
johns says more than ten million routes have been assessed using data from sources such as the geneva based bureau of aircraft accidents archives the united states national transportation safety board and the montreal based international civil aviation organization
for my analysis i only include crashes where there was at least one passenger fatality which is the relevant <unk> for those with a fear of flying says johns
i then incorporate the volume of flights <unk> to the most recent ten years to provide the final one in a million statistics
johns admits the timing of the release of the app was awkward given that it came out just days after airasia flight qz eight thousand five hundred and one went down
the developer says it was an unfortunate coincidence
i actually developed the app in february two thousand and fourteen shortly before the malaysia airlines mh three hundred and seventy disappearance says johns
due to that i postponed the release and worked on a few other things then finalized and submitted it to apple in december
the airasia qz eight thousand five hundred and one flight crashed two weeks later
there have been a few raised eyebrows but most people know it was a coincidence

in a much trailed speech in davos at a reception at the world economic forum the resilient royal reiterated and reaffirmed the <unk> denials made by buckingham palace issued on his behalf over accusations that he was repeatedly intimate with an alleged underage sex slave
andrew still fifth in line to the british throne and queen elizabeth <unk> second son carefully and wisely avoided mentioning the name virginia roberts the woman at the center of the <unk> claims
he also did not repeat the specific allegations made against him
for the record those allegations are that miss roberts now thirty one was <unk> to be used as an underage <unk> and was forced to sexually service the prince who she knew as andy by her wealthy boss <unk> and convicted sex <unk> jeffrey epstein
she says she was seventeen years old at the time of her first encounter with prince andrew which is under the legal age of consent in florida
she claims in court papers that <unk> scotland yard protection officers left her alone with him the first time he had sex with her and that she was later involved in an orgy with the prince and approximately eight other girls
five photos were also submitted including one which miss roberts said showed her aged fifteen when she says she began working as a sex slave for epstein
she insists she is telling the truth and wants prince andrew to repeat his denials on oath
in his for the record speech prince andrew stressed my focus is on my work
it has prompted some to ask what exactly is it that the duke of york does and what is the point of him
since his association with convicted sex <unk> <unk> epstein forced the duke to accept a <unk> of his role as a uk trade envoy in two thousand and eleven he has been busy trying to carve out a new role for himself
he has continued to support business in the uk but without a specialized role as before
in recent months many high ranking figures at buckingham palace believed was on the right track and making progress in achieving that new role
i have witnessed personally what a good no nonsense <unk> andrew is at events he has inspired and hosted
he is particularly passionate when dealing with young start up entrepreneurs and bringing them together with successful businesses at networking and showcasing events
andrew is direct and to the point and his methods seem to work
there is no doubt he is passionate about these issues and before this sex scandal blew up in his face he was making a good fist of it
as he said in his davos speech but went widely unreported as his sound bite about the sex allegations took all the attention
i focus on inspiring young people to develop skills to enable them to become economically active and encouraging a culture of enterprise and entrepreneurship
two of the important initiatives he has inspired are the digital enterprise awards referred to as idea which he is working with the <unk> trust to deliver
this is about to engage and to inspire young people to get not only digital skills but enterprise skills and to expand their knowledge in the digital universe
so far in year one about ten thousand young people are engaged in the program
his second big project is pitch palace a bid to support start up businesses
in two thousand and fourteen the duke launched pitch palace and held two competitive pitch events at st <unk> palace worked with seventy six entrepreneurs from across the uk
each event was attended by around four hundred invited investors mentors and supporters
on the day <unk> was trending four th in the uk on twitter
since then more than seven hundred connections made between the entrepreneurs and the audience
some results for the entrepreneurs featured include
financial <unk> startup <unk> which has raised five hundred k hired four new employees and received media coverage on cnn and other major media outlets
andrew argues passionately that entrepreneurs need more than just money
they need business partners they need <unk> they need customers and they need network and of course investors
essentially his new role is all about assisting the economic success of and the creation of skilled jobs in the uk
his efforts focus on three core areas where he believes he can have the greatest impact
education and skills promoting <unk> as a desirable path to a career is one of his big issues
he is patron of the studio schools trust and the baker <unk> educational trust among others
last year he visited nine university technical colleges and studio schools as well as twenty four other educational projects or institutions interacting with in excess of five thousand students and <unk>
entrepreneurship is his second core focus encouraging entrepreneurship in the uk supporting current start ups and efforts to develop a culture of enterprise
thirdly supporting science technology and engineering promoting expertise in these areas which attract investment into uk and promoting the further translation of science into business
he has also been key in showcasing the work of the uk technology industry and innovators
last month he hosted the duke of york award for technical education at st <unk> palace to celebrate the achievements of students in university technical colleges across the united kingdom
there is no doubt this work is all highly <unk>
but it is not his work life that is under scrutiny but his judgment
but if prince andrew hopes his unprecedented move to speak out publicly about his private life will draw a line under the scandal he is mistaken
why
because there are still simply too many unanswered questions about his role in the scandal <unk> him
not least what was the nature of his relationship with epstein a man convicted of <unk> underage woman for prostitution why did he visit him after he was released from prison and what was the nature of his association with virginia roberts who he was photographed with when she says she was a teenager
this combined with the fact the ongoing civil court case in the u.s. against epstein and three women could just keep turning up new embarrassing allegations about the duke
however it is important to remember the prince is not facing legal proceedings over the u.s. claims
he has simply been named in court papers
he has not done anything illegal until someone proves he has
to date he has not been charged with anything either
it may be wiser for the media to show a measure of fairness and restraint when reporting allegations that are no matter how <unk> and good copy after all just that allegations
the only way perhaps andrew can hope to move on is by giving a detailed rebuttal of all the allegations that have been made against him in a sworn affidavit
his namesake line paid tribute to the designer with a post on twitter citing a quote by camuto that read life is an adventure
seize the opportunity and find your passion
in one thousand nine hundred and seventy eight camuto co founded nine west with jerome fisher
in one thousand nine hundred and ninety nine they sold what had become one of the country's largest shoe companies to the jones group inc. for nearly nine hundred million dollar
nine west which has expanded into clothing and accessories celebrated <unk> influence on its facebook page
thank you for making women look and feel more beautiful from our head to our <unk>
you will be missed
camuto went on to create the camuto group in two thousand and one acquiring licenses for brands like <unk> max <unk> lucky brand and <unk> <unk> helping the latter create her now signature <unk> ballet flat
under the camuto group he launched three of his own clothing and <unk> lines <unk> camuto <unk> signature and louise et <unk> in two thousand and five
that year he purchased the license for the jessica simpson collection
simpson mourned the loss of camuto on instagram <unk> him as a mentor and the creator of all my dreams
i will forever walk in your shoes
you made them she continued
camuto is survived by his wife louise and five children
in his continuing effort to connect to a younger audience president barack obama sat down with and took questions from three youtube stars
<unk> green <unk> mota and half of the <unk>
there were some hard hitting questions about drones college education and racial profiling
but he gets those all the time
like when <unk> green asked obama about the administration's policy on cuba saying that fidel castro puts the d in dictatorship
or when green offered obama green <unk> as gifts to the ladies of the house including as she put it one for your first wife
my first wife
obama said
do you know something i don't know
or obama's interesting answer when <unk> mota asked what super power he would choose
he said he'd like to fly
and then offered his self proclaimed nerdy answer
to be able to speak any foreign language
i would love like anybody i met anywhere in the world i'd be able to just talk obama said
and of course there was a group selfie because no social media stunt would be complete without one
since we're attacking there is no sense to have peace talks now <unk> <unk> leader of the self proclaimed people's republic of donetsk said in a meeting with university students according to his media office
we've made this mistake before
it's not decent to repeat it he said
thousands have been killed in months of conflict between the rebels and ukrainian troops and a ceasefire agreed to in september crumbled long ago
<unk> comments came two days after the foreign ministers of ukraine and russia met in berlin to discuss a way out of the violence
but <unk> showed no interest in the talks
there will be no attempts from our side to talk about the ceasefire he said reported russian state news agency ria
we will be on the offensive until we reach the border of donetsk region
he said that he was interested in cooperating with ukraine on prisoner exchanges
we need to get our guys who've been captured he said according to ria
despite the talks in berlin violence in the breakaway donetsk and luhansk regions in eastern ukraine shows no signs of abating
power is out in and around luhansk after militants <unk> a power plant there luhansk regional official <unk> <unk> told ukraine's state run ukrinform news agency
<unk> noted that the local water supply and <unk> are off and <unk> buses aren't operating
thursday's shelling of a transit stop in donetsk city an attack that ukraine's defense ministry blamed on rebels killed eight civilians according to state news reports
but ukrainian troops have come under heavy fire as well
that includes one hundred and fifteen attacks in a recent twenty four hour period that killed three troops and wounded fifty more ukrinform reported friday
the news agency said that russian terrorist troops faced off with ukrainian soldiers thursday along <unk> highway even posting a picture that showed a man with stripes on his clothing suggesting that he was part of the russian military
this is in line with kiev's repeated assertions that russia has not only actively supported rebels with arms but has sent its own troops across the border to battle ukrainian forces
on wednesday for instance ukrainian president petro poroshenko said that more than nine thousand russian troops our russian ukrainian border bring with them hundreds and hundreds of tanks armed personnel carriers and killing ukrainian civilians and attacking ukrainian troops
russian foreign minister sergey lavrov promptly responded to this assertion with a firm denial much like other denials made by russian officials in recent months over similar allegations of armed intervention
as to the flow of troops and <unk> this is not the first time we hear something like that he said
and each time i hear that i say if you're so confident about that please present us with facts but no one has been able to provide us with these facts
pro russian separatists have claimed control of parts of eastern ukraine since the spring of two thousand and fourteen despite a push by ukrainian forces to defeat them
from mid april to january twenty one the conflict had killed at least five thousand and eighty six people and injured at least ten thousand nine hundred and forty eight others said the united nations
we fear that the real figure may be considerably higher the office of the u.n. high commissioner for human rights said about the death toll in a report released friday
at least two hundred and sixty two people were killed in the fighting from january thirteen through wednesday alone the report said
unrest in ukraine began with protests in the country's capital last year after president viktor yanukovych favoring closer ties to russia dropped plans to sign a political and economic agreement with the european union
after months of protests and days of deadly clashes between demonstrators and security personnel in kiev parliament ousted yanukovych in february
weeks later russia annexed the crimean peninsula
then in april violence broke out in two ukrainian regions that border russia donetsk and luhansk as separatist leaders declared independence from the government in kiev

following her second round victory over <unk> <unk> on wednesday a male interviewer had asked the twenty year old bouchard for a <unk>
as it turns out <unk> request for greater equality had already been granted before she <unk> on court
in a video posted on the australian <unk> website dated january nineteen fourteen time grand slam winner rafael nadal known partly for his muscular physique was asked to bare his chest
the question came not from a man or woman but from what looked like a tablet device as part of a series where tennis players are <unk> on various subjects as they are driven around melbourne in a car manufactured by one of the <unk> sponsors
the exact question to nadal was this
females love when you take your top off
can you do it now
i have to do it now
replied nadal who was sitting beside his public relations manager
he then took off his sweatshirt and began to take off his t shirt before leaving it on
i am joking he said with a smile as the t shirt stayed on
nadal's interview hasn't attracted much attention but <unk> jean king the twelve time grand slam winner and longtime advocate for equality took note of the question to bouchard and was less than <unk>
and in a tweet posted thursday king wrote
the australian open interviewer asking the women to <unk> on court is out of line
this is truly sexist
if you ask the women you have to ask the guys to <unk> as well
let's focus on competition and accomplishments of both <unk> and not our looks
amid the controversy bouchard <unk> her trademark cool after <unk> caroline garcia friday
personally i'm not offended bouchard said
no i think it was an in the moment thing and it was funny
but yeah i mean it's just funny how it's taken a life of its own
i'm just going to try to focus on my tennis
that's the message from the bulletin of atomic scientists which moved its iconic doomsday clock up two minutes on thursday
the clock now stands at three minutes to midnight the latest it's been since one thousand nine hundred and eighty four when the cold war between the u.s. and soviet union was a major issue
today unchecked climate change and a nuclear arms race resulting from modernization of huge <unk> pose extraordinary and undeniable threats to the continued existence of humanity
and world leaders have failed to act with the speed or on the scale required to protect citizens from potential catastrophe said <unk> benedict executive director of the bulletin of the atomic scientists in a news release
these failures of leadership endanger every person on earth
the <unk> science and security board looks at global issues on a regular basis and decides whether to move the minute hand of the clock with particular stress on the status of nuclear arms and reaction to climate issues
in recent years the clock has moved the wrong direction for humanity
after standing at seventeen minutes to midnight in one thousand nine hundred and ninety one the furthest it's ever been from the end of the world it's gotten closer each time it's been changed since with the exception of two thousand and ten when it was pushed back by one minute to eleven fifty four p.m
the last time the clock was moved was in two thousand and twelve when it was moved up one minute to eleven fifty five
the scientists expressed disappointment at the latest developments
noting that nuclear trends are moving backwards the science and security board's sharon <unk> pointed out that weapons modernization programs and disarmament have ground to a halt
and action on climate change
efforts at reducing global emissions of heat trapping gases have so far been entirely insufficient to prevent unacceptable climate disruption said the <unk> richard <unk>
we all need to respond now while there is still time
the doomsday clock was first put out in one thousand nine hundred and forty seven
the closest the clock has been to midnight was in one thousand nine hundred and fifty three when it was set at eleven fifty eight p.m
using the resting metropolis as a backdrop sola draws swift shapes in the air with the light wand
thirty seconds later the camera shutter clicks and the light artist grabs his kit disappearing once more into the night
welcome to the elusive magical world of lightbombing
sola is the street artist alter ego of forty year old photographer peter <unk> who has been capturing the urban landscape of birmingham streets since shortly after <unk> there in two thousand
much of the city had become ex industrial space and sola recalls how upon first appearances the city seemed somewhat run down
but a chance late night shoot revealed the transformative nature of <unk> on the city
what were once dead spaces became a <unk> stage for the photographer to illuminate
meeting in the heart of the city's creative quarter sola <unk> me warmly before grabbing a coffee and sitting down
dressed casually in a sweatshirt jeans and sneakers his face lights up with enthusiasm as he begins to explain the art of lightbombing
lightbombing is long exposure photography where the artist draws intricate designs patterns or words using hand held lights in front of a camera in pitch black darkness
while many artists around the world experiment with long exposure photography and light art sola coined the term lightbombing
it's me the <unk> and the <unk> he says grinning
to the average casual observer who just happens to come across me i look like a complete <unk>
i'm in the street waving a torch around
it's so dark you can't see my camera ninety percents of the time
and you're looking at this dude running around thinking what the hell is going on
his technique borrows elements from graffiti including bombing where the artist gets to a location does the work and is gone
sola's physical process lasts mere seconds and leaves a continuous fluctuating stroke on the final photograph as if by magic
it's like drawing on the page and when i move the light in front of a camera it leaves that mark
if you go faster it leaves a thinner mark and if you go slower it leaves a brighter mark explains the artist
then for just a brief moment sola's face becomes solemn
although striking and entertaining to see lightbombing isn't some frivolous hobby
explaining his vocation sola's voice is filled with passion for his work as he <unk> that what you see is what he shoots
he's adamant that the camera should capture the moment and only permits himself to edit the photographs in as much as a <unk> would allow
i never edit my photos
you should shoot it for real he says
when i grew up with film you had to make it in the camera
there was no messing around
you couldn't do much afterwards in post edit
yet some of the most iconic imagery of all time was shot on film and very little touches with a brush afterwards on the print
i think there is something important about that
he adds
i very purposefully don't shoot under direct light
i don't hang around
i don't wear bright clothing
i wish i wore some crazy ninja <unk> suit or something
i'm not going to get arrested
often he will spend weeks <unk> the perfect location for his latest collection
and while he's always eager to find a new space he says he has no desire to be arrested
as long as i don't break anything to get in i'm not forcing entry
if there is a fence down there's a fence down
i'm just wandering around
by and large it is never my intention to <unk>
i'm walking around and if there is a way into a space i might use it
the popularity of sola's light art has offered the photographer some exciting opportunities in the last few years including working with commercial partners such as nike for ad campaigns and traveling to dubai for a three week collaboration with local artists
he has also shot scenes in the british countryside and during the <unk> annual music festival
using the city as his playground he never returns to the same location twice explaining that he thinks it helps keep his work fresh
but just for once tonight he has driven me to an abandoned car park he recently shot at
as he <unk> <unk> his tripod and snaps his camera in to place sola claims anyone can duplicate his method all you need is a light source and a camera
the first few i did were with road safety maintenance lights that you have in your car
you can use anything you could use your phone
you can use anything that has got a light
i use certain items i'm not a painter but they are my brushes and also my <unk> tools as well
different ones do different things
different filters go onto them and to help me realize what i need that light form to do
after a few test shots to check the light and angles of the <unk> rooftop he turns on a meter long light bar with what looks like purple transparency paper taped to one side and begins moving in front of the camera
i'm working out which strokes to make and where to put them in order to achieve what i want to do
so again there's little nuances
the perspectives of what you expect it to be are out he says
by using angles and basically taking maximum advantage of the camera and tools at hand to shift the perspectives i think that's when you start to take it away from being real
it takes into a sort of wonderful mystical element
and how long does it take for sola to create these dazzling light sculptures
rather <unk> he replies
about six minutes
in out shoot
get back in the car
as he comes back to the camera to check each shot sola describes how it is quite meditative to work late into the night and how he often falls into a zen like state while designing his pieces
but while he <unk> <unk> about the <unk> beauty of a deserted city he's also quick to remind me of the ever present danger
you're on your own from a safety perspective and it is an expensive camera bag that i'd quite like to keep hold of
it can lead to some <unk> moments
i'm pretty much fast enough to get gone
i try to shoot wherever possible near to my car
most of the time when anyone even vaguely sketchy gets close enough you show them what you're doing and they are so blown away by it that you diffuse the situation
while he is open to sharing his techniques with the world this <unk> <unk> of light rarely features himself in his work preferring to let the photographs speak for themselves
i just want to inspire people with my work
if someone can look at a piece and be excited inspired moved in any way shape or form then i'm happy job done
because there is not enough of that in life
and there's too much art
this is why i strip away the <unk> stuff
it's there and i could sit and wax about it but no one wants to hear that really
everyone can get something different from it
it keeps it accessible to people
despite the near freezing temperatures out on city streets tonight hours fly by as we move from location to location
finally after one last shot sola makes his way back to the camera <unk> at the screen and concludes he's ready to call it a night
as he flips his tripod and pushes the legs back into the locked position i ask him where he wants to take the moving art form next
a lot of my work is very abstract he says
a lot of my work has that magical element that <unk> thing but sometimes there is not enough <unk> to it
the nike campaign was a starting point
but i'd like to up the game essentially high end fashion
do beautiful work with more people in them
i love the abstract work but for my heart need to shoot with people

another vaccine from merck and newlink will also be tested
shipping the vaccine today is a major achievement and shows that we remain on track with the accelerated development of our candidate ebola vaccine dr. <unk> <unk> chairman of global vaccines at gsk said in a company release
ebola who is patient zero
in december the trial of the vaccine made by merck and newlink were stopped after some of the volunteers in the trial had transient mild joint pain
after investigating that side effect scientists concluded it was not a big enough issue to stop the development of the vaccine
no similar side effects were noted in the gsk trial
there are other ebola vaccines being tested by companies in the united states and in russia
this first shipment will be used along with a placebo in this first large scale trial in the next few weeks in liberia
we are expecting to start by the last week in january but there are some details that need to be ironed out regarding the fda said dr. anthony fauci the director of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases at a press conference
worst ebola outbreak in history
what you should know
the tests should begin in the monrovia area and will involve nearly thirty thousand people
people who have had the virus and survived will be excluded from this trial according to gsk
the first people to get the vaccine will be health care workers who are some of the population that is most at risk for catching ebola
that's because it can be easily transmitted through exposure to bodily fluids
in liberia there have been three hundred and seventy cases of health care workers becoming infected with ebola one hundred and seventy eight of them have died according to the world health organization
the number of newly infected health care workers has declined recently as has the number of cases in general in liberia
in august and september of two thousand and fourteen the who was seeing three hundred new confirmed cases per week versus the eight new confirmed cases according to this latest incident report
another trial in sierra leone should start a few weeks after the trials get started in liberia according to the nih
sierra leone has had the largest number of infections of any country with ten thousand three hundred and forty reported cases and three thousand one hundred and forty five deaths from ebola
the disease has slowed down according to the who but still there were one hundred and seventeen new confirmed cases according to the latest report
the centers for disease control and prevention will work with sierra leone's government to help manage the tests
the nih will also soon be testing the therapeutic drug zmapp as early as next month
zmapp is an experimental drug that has been used to help patients who have already been infected by the virus
the drug maker mapp biopharmaceutical ran out of the drug last year but has been making enough doses for a small human trial
the number of new ebola cases in liberia has been declining but public health leaders say that there are still little mini outbreaks and that until there is a very last case is not over until it is over fauci said
since the outbreak began in december two thousand and thirteen there have been twenty one thousand seven hundred and fifty nine infections and eight thousand six hundred and sixty eight people have died from ebola
a pair of nine year olds in new hampshire who were left alone for days at a time over five months in their family's apartment with just <unk> noodles to eat and no <unk> telephone are now safely in the care of their parents according to a court affidavit
the twins uncle who had been entrusted to care for them has been charged with endangering a child according to michael <unk> <unk> county assistant attorney
the charge is a misdemeanor
<unk> <unk> told police he agreed to watch his brother and sister in law's twin boys while the couple traveled to nigeria in july but instead of moving into the apartment <unk> said he checked on the children three days a week
the children told officials who were called to the home that they would wake for school on their own get ready for school get on the bus and eat breakfast and lunch at school according to the affidavit
<unk> said he told the children to call him if they needed anything such as food or help with their homework but because the phone in the apartment wasn't <unk> he instructed them to use a <unk> phone
officials visited the home after the new hampshire division for children youth and families received a call from the children's school
a police officer said there was no edible food in the refrigerator and only <unk> noodles in the cabinet
the boys parents were supposed to return from nigeria after a month but were held up because of illness and passport issues
they told police they had spoken to <unk> by phone while they were gone and were told everything was ok
according to <unk> the parents arrived shortly after learning the children had been left alone and they do have custody of their children
no charges are expected to be filed against the parents because they left the children in the care of the uncle <unk> said in a release
in his best selling <unk> journalist and trend <unk> james wallman argues that we are reaching the end of <unk> and <unk> <unk> as a new dominant lifestyle
pleasure would come from experiences such as <unk> jumps and holidays rather than cars and jewelry
it feels better to do stuff than to have stuff as he <unk> puts it
with a new edition the author goes beyond lifestyle to examine how this fundamental shift will affect our working lives
we experience material pressure at work too it can be worse than at home says wallman pointing out the number of status symbols from clothes to desk <unk> which can make an office feel like an arms race
<unk> is full of suggestions and examples of how to ease this pressure beginning with ruthless de <unk>
there are signs that this is a rising priority in business visible in the growth of professional <unk> services and even digital <unk>
for wallman de <unk> lays the ground for the next step
it allows for an emphasis on experience which suits a new breed of worker
in times of <unk> we were working just for the money but more of us are becoming lucky enough to work for more than that he says
we want to enjoy ourselves and we want to change how the world <unk> in their twenties now are doing what they want to do rather than worry about the money
notwithstanding that the age of abundance has hardly eliminated <unk> labor yet and that across the world such luxury of choice remains a rarity the author foresees that three new models will come to define a radically different working experience
the first is the hotel california model
a workplace so good you'll never leave
the lights are on twenty four seven because there is so much there that it's as much fun as life outside of work
the google offices in california are a great example it has pool tables bikes to get around the campus and the food is better than at home
wallman recalls the unique environment around watching a super bowl with the google team
they were all friends work and play had become the same
work was something they wanted to do
a sense of mission is key to generating such close bonds and commitment
wallman cites the work of leading business strategist <unk> erickson who emphasizes the need for companies to capture the hearts and minds of employees and appealing to shared values in order to recruit keep and motivate a sophisticated workforce
wallman also points to the rise of b corporations which are dedicated to delivering social benefits in addition to profits as examples of a changing landscape in which management must sell <unk> value rather than just a living to a generation of employees that have come to expect more
in addition to the hotel california wallman has coined the <unk> model defined by extreme flexibility inspired by the classic tv ads which promised anytime anywhere
i know someone who trades from mauritius and another who runs a restaurant in <unk> from bali he says
they can also operate at their convenience rather than having to meet fixed hours
finally there are third spaces for people that enjoy the freedom of the <unk> model but also appreciate regular human contact
wallman points to the rise of relaxed co working spaces for <unk> of all disciplines that combine games rooms with stable facilities such the fueled collective site in new york city
looking even further ahead wallman is excited by the possibilities of automation to give workers even more freedom including permanent disruption of the five day week
as with all social trends the shift to <unk> must work its way through the early adopters but wallman believes it will rapidly become a universal <unk> offering value for businesses and fulfillment for employees
it may seem like fantasy he says
but the standard of living changed incredibly in the twenty th century and the shift from <unk> will <unk> will transform quality of life in the twenty one st century
when we go to work it will be to enjoy ourselves
the <unk> who spoke on condition of anonymity told egypt's state owned ahram online that the <unk> beard broke off by accident when the mask fell as it was being cleaned last year at the egyptian museum in cairo
he said the blue and gold <unk> beard was fixed back in place quickly with <unk> a type of strong <unk>
the <unk> was not a proper material to use to restore the mask although it is a conservation material with a very high strength for attaching metal and stone he is quoted as saying
the <unk> said there was now a gap between the face and the beard where the glue had dried
however the egyptian museum's general director mahmoud el <unk> dismissed the claims in an interview with ahram online saying the beard was in its original position and that nothing had happened to the mask since he took up his position in october
an archaeological committee was assigned to inspect the mask and beard in order to write a detailed report on the <unk> condition he said
minister of antiquities <unk> <unk> also told ahram online that media reports of damage to the mask were unfounded
the boy king's elaborate burial mask discovered in his tomb in one thousand nine hundred and twenty two is one of egypt's most outstanding artifacts
<unk> who ruled from one thousand three hundred and thirty six one thousand three hundred and twenty seven bc is thought to have been about seventeen years old when he died based on analysis of his mummy according to the british museum
his cause of death is not known
if confirmed it won't be the first time a historical treasure was damaged in an institution supposed to keep it safe
in two thousand and six a visitor to the <unk> museum in cambridge england famously <unk> on a staircase and smashed three hugely valuable chinese qing dynasty <unk>
the thousands of <unk> fragments were eventually painstakingly <unk>
his two decades at the helm of one of the west's key strategic allies in the muslim world left an indelible if ambiguous legacy
here are the five most notable characteristics of his reign
hopes were high that abdullah's reputation as a modernizing reformer would translate into gains for women in the <unk> kingdom
but in the face of deep seated cultural opposition to change the progress was less than expected said cnn's senior international correspondent <unk> robertson
he promised a lot of reforms but
he was limited by the conservative nature of saudi society
abdullah was the first saudi monarch to appoint women to government positions
in two thousand and thirteen he appointed thirty women to the one hundred and fifty member shura council the top <unk> body that plays an advisory role within saudi arabia's absolute monarchy
this year women will be able to vote and run as candidates in municipal elections for the first time and women have been elected to boards of chambers of commerce
but many other restrictions on saudi women remain
women can not marry leave the country go to school or open bank accounts without permission from a male guardian usually their father or husband
saudi arabia remains the only country where women are not allowed to drive despite petitions and civil disobedience campaigns by activists in recent years
in november the shura council recommended that the ban be lifted with restrictions but the recommendation has not been acted on and those who defy the ban continue to be prosecuted
robert w. jordan who served as u.s
ambassador to saudi arabia form two thousand and one to two thousand and three said he had frequent conversations with abdullah about human rights including the rights of women in the kingdom
he said don't push us to breaking point jordan told cnn
it's a halting kind of process of reform one that requires this kind of juggling
ali al ahmed a former saudi political prisoner and the director of the institute for gulf affairs said abdullah's reputation as a reformer in some quarters was <unk>
the kingdom has been under international scrutiny in recent weeks for carrying out harsh punishments including executions and floggings
reforms in saudi arabia do not exist
this is an absolute monarchy let's be honest he said
the september eleven two thousand and one attacks on saudi arabia's key ally in which fifteen of the nineteen attackers were saudi were an <unk> point for the kingdom
abdullah lobbied for the removal of u.s. troops who had been stationed in the country since one thousand nine hundred and ninety a prime <unk> for the september eleven attackers then set about bolstering its military with a one hundred and fifty billion dollar spend
attacks on residential compounds housing many westerners in which dozens were killed led to a harsh crackdown on terrorist elements within the kingdom seeking to topple the house of saud
leaders were captured followers driven underground and radical preachers <unk> said robertson
saudi arabia has taken a lead role in the u.s. led international coalition fighting the radical sunni terror group isis which now rivals al qaeda as the world's most prolific jihadist group in syria and iraq
but questions remain about the links between saudi arabia and islamist terror
in an interview with cnn's christiane amanpour in october billionaire saudi businessman prince <unk> bin <unk> acknowledged that unfortunately some extremists in saudi arabia
did fund certain extremist elements in syria but insisted that the support had been stopped
others argue that <unk> the <unk> form of sunni islam that is the kingdom's official religion promoted throughout the muslim world provides the ideological breeding ground for such groups
saudi arabia now faces a threat from isis on its on border
earlier this month isis allegedly attacked a saudi border patrol near <unk>
the kingdom is building a massive fence along its border with iraq in order to keep the militants out said robertson
one of abdullah's greatest <unk> has been his focus on modernizing the saudi education system said mark <unk> author of prophets and princes
saudi arabia from muhammad to the present
following a failed attempt in one thousand nine hundred and seventy nine by extremist insurgents to capture <unk> grand mosque and topple the saudi leadership the kingdom responded by becoming even more conservative said robertson
this renewed <unk> was reflected in the education system for two decades until abdullah began an ambitious program of modernization despite opposition from religious conservatives
the centerpiece is the king abdullah scholarship program which has sent hundreds of thousands of young saudis abroad to study at the government's expense
the aim is to develop a workforce of saudi nationals capable of replacing <unk> workers in higher skilled jobs in the kingdom but also to bring a more modern international outlook to the kingdom
giving these scholarships recognizes that the road of modernizing saudi arabia comes from education said robertson
at home the country's first <unk> campus king abdullah university of science and technology was founded amid some objections in two thousand and nine
in expressing his condolences u.s. president barack obama credited abdullah for his commitment to the education of his country

who is saudi arabia's new king salman
while abdullah's legacy as a social reformer is up for debate his achievements at economic reform are more clear cut say observers
besides his educational reform the late king's other lasting achievement was joining the world trade organization in two thousand and five integrating his country into the global economy said <unk>
abdullah opened his country up for foreign direct investment and committed huge sums of the country's oil wealth on infrastructure and mega projects such as the eighty six billion dollar king abdullah economic city announced in two thousand and five
the reforms reflected abdullah's recognition of the need to <unk> the country's economy ahead of the inevitable day the oil money ran out said robertson
saudi arabia also lifted its international profile under abdullah's rule with the late king taking a strong role in regional and world affairs
obama in expressing his condolences praised the monarch for his bold steps in advancing middle east peace initiatives and for greater outreach to the international community
during his reign saudi arabia became the only arab nation with a seat at the g twenty and the first <unk> of the two holy mosques as the saudi monarchs are known to meet the pope
abdullah espoused a message of religious tolerance despite the <unk> of saudi <unk> said robertson
to the south yemen is in chaos
to the north the militant group isis is <unk> havoc in iraq and syria
more broadly saudi arabia remains locked in a regional cold war with iran
within the kingdom's borders salman has to decide how to pace sensitive reforms while keeping a <unk> on extremism
the stakes are high in one of the leading regional powers in the middle east and a key u.s. ally
saudi arabia has been critical to preserving some degree of regional stability in the face of a growing iranian threat during the rise of islamic extremism that followed the u.s. <unk> of afghanistan and iraq and during the new wave of <unk> that began in the spring of two thousand and eleven anthony h. cordesman a middle east expert at the center for strategic and international studies wrote in a commentary this month
here are some of the main challenges salman now faces
the new king has been plunged straight into the deep end with a fast developing crisis on saudi arabia's southern border
the pro saudi government in yemen has crumbled amid sectarian unrest
the country's president and prime minister resigned thursday night after a move by shiite houthi rebels to gain power in the capital in recent days
sunni majority saudi arabia which provides energy and financial support to yemen and shares a long border with it is looking on with growing anxiety fearful of the prospect of another shiite dominated state in the region
this will <unk> the saudis just as the shia uprising in bahrain did said cnn intelligence and security analyst bob baer
saudi arabia all these years has avoided sending troops into yemen
it's a <unk> for the saudis said baer
they've got a reinforced border and they've put a lot of troops down there
but still they are <unk>
mohammed albasha a spokesman for the yemeni embassy in washington told cnn on wednesday that without saudi support yemen will become a failed state
it's not far from that already
the poorest country in the region yemen is home to al qaeda in the arabian peninsula which u.s. officials consider to be the most dangerous branch of the terrorist network according to cnn terrorism analyst paul cruickshank
the yemen crisis feeds into a broader issue for saudi arabia
the growing influence of iran in the region
yemeni officials have frequently accused iran of providing financial support and weapons to the houthis in an effort to control yemen's red sea coast on one of the world's busiest shipping lanes
that makes saudi arabia very uncomfortable said cnn global affairs analyst bobby <unk>
saudi arabia a sunni majority country regards shia run iran as a mortal enemy
both are facing each other off in a bizarre game of chess they're playing across the arab world
tensions have <unk> between tehran and riyadh at least as far back as iran's islamic revolution in one thousand nine hundred and seventy nine
the conflict in syria has been viewed as a proxy conflict between the two with iran supporting the regime of president bashar al assad and saudi arabia helping rebel groups
but the rise of the isis extremists amid the relentless bloodshed of the syrian war has complicated the equation
there are signs by the saudis and the iranians that it is in their interests to de escalate tensions to confront isis said <unk> al <unk> a fellow at harvard's <unk> institute for advanced study
but it's impossible to move from hostility to alliance quickly
although the two sides realize that isis is a threat to some extent to both of them they don't think it is so big a threat as to move that fast to cooperation he said in november
the bloodthirsty seizure of large <unk> of territory in syria and iraq by isis has created a major headache in the region for the saudis
and the attempts of isis leader abu bakr al baghdadi to style himself as spiritual leader of muslims presents a challenge to the saudi monarchy which is responsible for islam's two holiest cities mecca and medina
the saudis fear it as a potential domestic threat turning salafism into a revolutionary political ideology rather than the pro regime <unk> it has usually been in saudi arabia says f. gregory <unk> iii a senior foreign policy fellow at the brookings institution in doha qatar
saudi arabia is considered to be a key u.s. ally in the fight against isis
one of salman's sons prince khaled was reportedly among the pilots who carried out the first airstrikes on isis positions in syria last year
but salman also has some responsibility for saudi arabia's backing of jihadist fighters in previous conflicts according to david andrew weinberg a senior fellow at the foundation for defense of democracies
salman played a significant role in the one thousand nine hundred and eighty s and one thousand nine hundred and ninety s gathering support in the royal family for <unk> holy warriors in places like afghanistan places like the <unk> weinberg told cnn
a number of these afghan and balkan veterans have in fact come back to saudi arabia and <unk> continued radicalism
the saudi government though has denied ever providing support to isis which is a splinter group of al qaeda
salman's predecessor king abdullah is credited with managing to ride out the <unk> of the arab spring that swept away other arab rulers
but with a fast growing population in an unstable region the royal family has no room for complacency
saudi arabia has faced and will face constant challenges in finding the pace of modernization and reform that pushes forward as fast as possible while retaining saudi popular support meeting saudi arabia's unique religious and cultural needs and ensuring that evolution will not turn into either <unk> or revolution said cordesman
as events in other parts of the region since two thousand and eleven have shown all too clearly it is easy to get things terribly wrong and very hard to keep them going right he wrote
while some observers have applauded abdullah's cautious reforms others say he moved too slowly
if you look at where saudi arabia is today it hasn't actually moved that far from when he assumed the throne in two thousand and five weinberg told cnn
the monarchy needs to allow greater freedoms for women improve the rights of the shiite minority modernize the education system and give greater powers to elected bodies according to cordesman
with the recent sharp drop in oil prices officials will have to chart a careful course for the economy
saudi arabia depends heavily on oil revenues to fund its government
above all the saudi government needs to ensure that its rapidly growing population will have meaningful jobs and futures cordesman said
the appeal came after president joko widodo rejected a plea for clemency from thirty one year old andrew chan the ringleader of a failed bid to smuggle more than eight kilograms of heroin to australia in two thousand and five
widodo had already turned down an appeal for clemency from myuran sukumaran chan's collaborator in the scheme which included seven other people who are serving lengthy prison sentences
together they are known as the bali nine
while australia respects indonesia's sovereignty we are asking that indonesia reconsider its decision to execute two australian citizens australian prime minister tony abbott said in statement
both men are reformed characters and both have helped to <unk> other prisoners
the <unk> of mercy should be extended to them
for the last ten years the pair has fought a lengthy legal battle first to avoid conviction against charges and later to reduce the severity of their sentences
the bali nine were arrested in april two thousand and five after indonesian police received a tip off from australian federal police
they caught four at the <unk> airport with more than eight kilograms of heroin strapped to their bodies
another four including sukumaran were arrested at a hotel in the village of <unk>
chan was detained after a boarding a plane to sydney he wasn't carrying any drugs but was named by others as the mastermind of the plot
during their ten years of imprisonment supporters say chan and sukumaran have changed their ways and are now working within the prison to help other inmates
lawyers had hoped their rehabilitation would count in their favor but their failed clemency bids have reinforced efforts to pursue other legal avenues
chan's lawyers are said to be seeking to reopen the case a controversial move that faces legal resistance from indonesia's supreme court according to indonesia law expert tim lindsey
currently the constitutional court allows an unlimited number of applications to reopen a case the supreme court does not
there's a dispute between the two courts at the moment
<unk> been attempts to bring them together to work out a resolution
it hasn't been successful
so as it stands the constitutional court says this application is acceptable and the supreme court says it's not lindsey told the abc
indonesia has long taken a tough line on drug smugglers and widodo has made it clear he doesn't intend to introduce a policy of <unk>
last week six prisoners were killed by firing squad including five foreigners from brazil the netherlands malawi nigeria and vietnam
brazil's president <unk> <unk> issued a statement saying the execution of one of her countrymen had severely affected relations with indonesia
australia's abbott says in the best interests of chan and sukumaran the government will make no further public comments but its support will continue
<unk> <unk> forty two started her hunger strike in two thousand after ten civilians were killed in a shooting blamed on the army in <unk> state
<unk> also known as the iron lady of <unk> has demanded the repeal of india's armed forces act because it gives sweeping powers to the military to search properties detain suspects without warrants and shoot on sight
since two thousand <unk> has been arrested fourteen times for trying to kill herself prompting authorities to force feed her under a law that makes attempted suicide illegal her counsel <unk> mani told cnn
but mani challenged the attempted suicide charge citing the country's history of hunger strikes
<unk> <unk> used the same mode of protest during the nation's independence struggle he told the sessions court in <unk> east a district of <unk>
i also argued that a hunger strike was no crime he said
the <unk> ruled there was insufficient evidence to prove she was attempting to commit suicide
in doing so he overturned a lower court's attempt to put her on trial for attempted suicide
after the court ordered her release <unk> resumed her hunger strike her lawyer added
last year india's vice president hamid <unk> admitted there had been serious complaints of misuse of the <unk>
this reflects poorly on the state and its agents a statement from his office said
meantime amnesty international called <unk> arrests <unk> saying she should not be taken into custody again
the judgment must end the <unk> cycle of arrest and re arrest that this brave activist has faced for so long
authorities must not detain <unk> <unk> again but engage with the issues she is raising said <unk> <unk> the rights group's program director in india
activists and non profit organizations have repeatedly urged the indian government to scrap the <unk>
in two thousand and five a government appointed committee recommended the law be <unk>
its recommendations remain under the government's consideration india's deputy home minister <unk> <unk> told the national parliament last month
<unk> is an impoverished <unk> state in india's remote northeastern belt
for years many <unk> tribal communities have resisted the authority of delhi claiming that they have suffered neglect from the central government
this <unk> has given rise to occasional outbreaks of violence
their photos and personal details have been splashed across a giant electronic screen outside a major train station in <unk> city in china's southern province hunan
curious onlookers and commuters gathered outside the bustling train station as a series of individual <unk> identity numbers their offenses and amounts of outstanding court fines rolled across a massive electronic billboard one after the other as shown on chinese state television
instead of flashing ads it serves as a public wall of shame for those that failed to pay court ordered fines for violating property disclosure laws <unk> court orders or failing to respond to <unk>
the amount of outstanding fines range from ten thousand yuan up to twenty nine million yuan
wang <unk> a court official told hunan city's largest newspaper <unk> morning post on wednesday that it was part of a campaign in the new year to beef up policy implementation measures
wang added that it was doing a public service by exposing the details
according to chinese supreme court regulations it is legal for local courts to publish private information of people or organizations who have <unk> court orders
the advertising agency that manages the billboard confirmed with cnn that the court has authorized them to publish personal details of the individuals and companies for two weeks until they pay off their debts
as of today we have taken down information of one company and two individuals because they have settled their debts with the courts said chen kai general manager of <unk> <unk> advertising company
he added that they did not charge the courts for any advertising fees in support of the court's decision to force <unk> to pay
for now the public also seems to support the court's <unk> tactics
now those people who are dishonest have nowhere to hide and dare not do it again zhou ya a man standing outside the railway station told hunan tv a local channel
the court has played <unk> by exposing these <unk> well done

he reached the wimbledon final taking the world no
one novak djokovic to five sets and ended the campaign by helping switzerland to a maiden davis cup title
but did all the tennis last year cost federer and his thirty three year old body at the australian open this year
was it a hand injury that he sustained earlier this week
or was his opponent simply too good
no matter what the potential reasons the end result is that federer will have to wait for a record extending eighteen th grand slam title after he lost to andreas seppi six four seven six four six seven six in the third round in melbourne on friday
there were no such troubles for rafael nadal andy murray and maria sharapova
that seppi was the man who knocked out federer was a surprise in their ten previous matches the italian had never won
he had claimed just one set
and against tennis big three of federer djokovic and nadal seppi owned a dismal one twenty five record
but the world no
forty six played one of his best matches crucially not crumbling when the finish line was in sight
instead it was federer who <unk> in the fourth set tiebreak
he led three one only to double fault at three two
then leading five four federer made a costly backhand unforced error
federer <unk> missed opportunities in the second set tiebreak too when seppi was there for the taking
it just broke me to lose that second set federer told reporters
and actually the fourth i should win it too
just a brutal couple of sets to lose there
seppi completed the upset in stunning fashion scrambling before hitting an <unk> <unk> passing shot winner down the line
for sure it was one of the important shots of my life said seppi
federer thus exited despite winning more points in the match overall one hundred and forty five to one hundred and forty four
i felt for some reason yesterday and this morning it was not going to be very simple today federer said
even in practice i still felt the same way
i was just hoping it was one of those feelings you sometimes have and it's totally not true and you just come out and you play a routine match
i was aware of the test and was well prepared
just somehow couldn't play my best tennis today
it was definitely partially because of andreas playing very well
perhaps the warning signs were there from his previous round
federer lost a set in the second round to <unk> fellow italian <unk> <unk>
he and this is rare for federer called for the trainer to address an issue with his hand
federer thought he might have been <unk> by a bee
he didn't mention the hand or any other physical issue in his briefing with reporters
federer also defended his decision to play exhibition matches in india in december during tennis notoriously short off season
i wanted to go to india said federer
i wanted to go back to switzerland for christmas
i practiced as hard as i possibly could
can't do more than that
sure the year ended late but one week later than normal
at the end of the day honestly i'm confident that what i did was the right thing
federer's exit means murray's path to the semifinals has become significantly easier
the two time grand slam champion and federer were on paper due to meet in the quarterfinals
while federer was sent packing murray easily dispatched <unk> <unk> sousa six one six one seven five
murray's performance wasn't the only topic of conversation during his press conference though
a particular tweet was mentioned too
after nadal visibly struggled on court in the second round and was close to vomiting in his five set victory over tim smyczek murray appeared to criticize the spaniard in this tweet
when i cramped and won in the us open last year i was a drama queen <unk> needs to see a shrink <unk> weird
murray wrote
but he insisted friday he wasn't targeting nadal
i didn't watch the whole match the other night but clearly rafa was struggling pretty badly murray said
it was a great effort to come through it which rightly is what everyone was saying
but that certainly wasn't the case at the u.s. open when i was in a similar state
and yeah i just don't understand why that would be the case
nadal looked better physically on court after suffering from cramps against smyczek eliminating israel's <unk> <unk> six one six zero seven five under the lights in rod laver arena
he saved all seven break points he faced and they all came in the third set
he said in an on court interview that he slept a lot in a bid to recover but didn't budge when asked for a percentage of how he felt physically
<unk> i was never very good in mathematics nadal joked
nadal and murray were joined in the fourth round by seventh seed tomas berdych and ten th seed <unk> dimitrov
second seed sharapova <unk> girlfriend swept aside thirty one st seed <unk> <unk> six one six one two days after saving match points against a russian qualifier
other winners in the women's draw included third seed <unk> halep and seventh seed <unk> bouchard

the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author
but are we causing it
oh no no no says half the senate
forty nine senators voted on wednesday against an amendment that said climate change is happening and crucially that it's actually for real caused by human emissions
that's something scientists are pretty <unk> sure about and have been for more than a decade
these votes particularly the not a hoax vote have been heralded by some in environmental circles including sen. barbara boxer d california as a sign of progress like a coming out party of sorts
at least the senators are going on record the argument goes
at least in a ninety eight to one vote they said in public that climate change is not a hoax
i'm not so sure
true there would be value in knowing where every senator stands on climate change
americans sixty one percents of whom say climate change is real and forty percents of whom know it's caused by people according to to a two thousand and fourteen pew survey have a right to know where their elected officials fall on this and many other important policy issues
but and this is an important but that's not what we learned on wednesday
we learned that ninety eight senators say climate change is happening without blaming humans for it
among them is jim <unk> r oklahoma who is perhaps washington's most vocal climate <unk>
he continued that streak this week
climate is changing and climate has always changed and always will there's archaeological evidence of that there's biblical evidence of that <unk> said on the senate floor according to bloomberg news and others
the hoax is that there are some people that are so arrogant to think that they are so powerful that they can change climate
man can't change climate
we also know that forty nine senators voted against the amendment saying climate change is in fact caused by human emissions of greenhouse gases
that could seem like a win for the left at least an effort to pin down senators who don't buy the science saying humans do contribute
but among the no votes was sen. lisa murkowski r alaska who said her reason for voting no simply was the word significantly according to the hill
and it means neither vote offers true clarity
these votes are more witch hunt than substance
the political left seems to want to embarrass the right for denying the facts of climate change
the right as <unk> <unk> of politico <unk> noted played this brilliantly appearing to take a the earth's not flat stance on this while actually ceding next to nothing
meanwhile the people we actually need to be listening to on this issue are not the politicians
they're the climate scientists who have been saying for years that the climate is changing that human emissions of greenhouse gases are the driving cause and that we need to act urgently to cut emissions
i hate doom and gloom climate politics as much as the next guy but that's the reality
and here's the other part of it
there's time to act
congress should debate how to respond to climate change not its very existence
the other voices that need to be heard in this debate are those of ordinary people all over the world who already are seeing their lives and livelihoods disturbed by warming temperatures and changing oceans
i met some of them last year at a three hundred thousand person climate rally in new york
they're people like <unk> smith this <unk> farmer in connecticut
and <unk> <unk> <unk> a young mom from the marshall islands in the pacific whose nation may be sunk by rising sea levels
i am fearful she told me but for the most part i'm optimistic
congress could take note and so should we
we should listen to their stories
listen to the science
debate the solutions
abdullah died early friday several weeks after the state run saudi press agency said he was suffering from pneumonia and had been admitted to a hospital
the royal court didn't release an exact cause of death
he was ninety
to ensure a smooth transition the kingdom quickly appointed his seventy nine year old half brother salman bin abdulaziz to the throne
his half brother prince muqrin a decade younger is the new crown prince
after friday afternoon prayers at <unk> imam turki bin abdullah grand mosque the body of abdullah wrapped in a pale <unk> was carried from the mosque toward a cemetery followed by a solemn procession of saudi men in traditional dress
he was later laid to rest after a simple swift ceremony
those present at the <unk> the royals closest to the late king were then to move on to a royal palace where they were to pay their respects to the new monarch
the ceremony of al <unk> or pledging of allegiance to the new king followed the funeral
condolences and <unk> poured in from all corners of the globe
to god we belong and indeed to him we shall return said the homepage of the english language saudi newspaper arab news
bahrain jordan and the palestinian territories among others declared days of mourning
the u.n. secretary general praised abdullah for his arab peace initiative to end the arab israeli conflict
u.s. vice president joe biden said he would lead a delegation in the coming days to pay respects
king abdullah's life spanned from before the birth of modern saudi arabia through its emergence as a critical force within the global economy and a leader among arab and islamic nations u.s. president barack obama said in a statement
speaking to cnn's richard quest in davos switzerland u.s. secretary of state john kerry said he expects no changes in his government's relations with saudi arabia
i don't anticipate anything based on the conversation we have had no he said
in an address to the nation his first televised appearance since becoming king salman offered his condolences to the saudi people
we will with god's will and power adhere to the straight path this country followed since its establishment by king abdulaziz and his sons after him and will not deviate at all from it since our constitution is the book of allah and the teachings of prophet mohammed he said
he also spoke of the desperate need for unity and solidarity among the followers of islam saying saudi arabia would continue to promote that
he had already issued six royal <unk> friday the saudi press agency reported including appointing prince mohammed bin <unk> bin abdulaziz as the deputy crown prince
salman who has one point three three million followers on twitter but follows no one changed his twitter handle to <unk>
abdullah became king of the oil rich nation a key u.s. ally in the middle east in august two thousand and five
but he had been running saudi arabia since one thousand nine hundred and ninety six after half brother king <unk> stroke
in the context of the kingdom's conservative circles abdullah was seen as a reformer and often came up against more hardline clerics
after <unk> to the throne abdullah took steps toward broader freedoms and invested some of the country's vast oil wealth in large scale education and infrastructure projects
he was really quite extraordinary figure
he was probably the most progressive and liberal minded king of saudi arabia since king faisal which is a long time ago in the early one thousand nine hundred and seventy s cnn's fareed zakaria said about abdullah whom he described as much loved
i had the opportunity to meet with him once and what you got a sense of was somebody who really was determined to move his country forward zakaria said
it's a conservative country and a conservative society and he kept emphasizing that to me but he was very clear in the direction he wanted to go
however resistance from conservative factions hindered some of his efforts leaving many women in particular disappointed by a lack of progress toward greater independence
under abdullah's leadership the country slowly <unk> al qaeda capturing or killing its leaders in the kingdom forcing the remnants underground and <unk> radical preachers
it also took a more prominent role in international affairs
last year it became the lead arab nation in a u.s. led coalition to eradicate the <unk> isis group in iraq and syria
analysts are predicting a smooth political transition despite the many challenges facing saudi arabia including iran the rise of isis the crisis in yemen and the drop in oil prices
saudi arabia has sixteen percents of the world's known oil reserves according to the u.s. energy information administration
the country is widely seen as the leader of opec and has a large influence on energy prices and political stability in the middle east
remember the last time the price of oil fell like this the soviet union collapsed said zakaria
that said the successor is a very competent man
he added
i don't expect any major shift but it marks a big change and we'll have to see what the new king is like
the man taking control of the world's top oil exporter is well established in the gulf kingdom's corridors of power
salman seventy nine is a stalwart of the royal family who is viewed as a pragmatic and cautious reformer much like his predecessor says cnn's <unk> anderson in abu dhabi
he has served as defense minister and deputy prime minister of saudi arabia a vital u.s. ally in the middle east for years
like abdullah he's one of the dozens of sons of saudi arabia's founder king abdulaziz
here are some of the key points about the new ruler
salman was governor of the saudi capital riyadh for nearly five decades during a period of significant change
when he became governor in one thousand nine hundred and sixty three riyadh had two hundred thousand inhabitants today it has more than seven million bruce riedel a senior fellow at the brookings <unk> center for middle east policy said in a commentary
salman presided over this remarkable transformation with a record for good governance and a lack of corruption
he had to be a combination
of a reformer of a judge a jury in some cases and deal with dissent as well as dealing with economic issues robert jordan a former u.s. ambassador to saudi arabia told cnn
so i think he's well prepared for the task at hand
salman's experience running riyadh also involved keeping many of the numerous members of the saudi royal family in line
since most of the royal princes and princesses live in riyadh he was also the family sheriff ensuring any transgressions were dealt with smoothly and quietly with no publicity said riedel who worked for the cia for thirty years
his national roles have since brought him wider responsibility
salman has been <unk> cabinet meetings for several months and handling almost all foreign travel responsibilities for the monarchy since he became the heir in two thousand and twelve riedel said
salman's ascension to the throne is in line with the appointments put in place by abdullah before his death
i think that you'll see a continuation very similar policies very similar dynamics unfolding said james <unk> president of the arab american institute
the kingdom is modernizing
it's changing it's reforming and it will continue to do so over the next several decades
riedel says the royal family values family <unk> and harmony highly
the two previous saudi <unk> in the eighteen th and nineteen th centuries were wracked by internal family <unk> which their foreign enemies exploited he explains
with the arab world facing its worst crisis in decades the royals will want to present an image of stability and strength
salman is one of abdullah's younger brothers
but at seventy nine he's not particularly young
there are unconfirmed reports that he may have various health problems
but with saudi arabian media tightly controlled by the state nobody's really sure what his condition is
riedel says salman has had a stroke simon henderson of the washington institute says the new king's brain is ravaged by dementia and the economist reports he's believed to be suffering from alzheimer's
reports do differ sharply over just how ill prince salman really is and medical reports on the illnesses of the saudi royal family can be grossly inaccurate cautioned anthony h. cordesman a middle east expert at the center for strategic and international studies
salman's schedule of official meetings suggests a degree of health
but henderson isn't convinced it proves he's highly capable
the fact that salman appears in public at all is attributed to his determination to become king or more likely the ambition of his closest relatives that he should do so he wrote last month
salman's first order after assuming the throne was to appoint his youngest brother prince muqrin as the new crown prince
analysts see that appointment as an effort to ensure future stability
abdullah had named muqrin as deputy crown prince in march
at sixty nine years old muqrin is relatively youthful
a former head of intelligence for the kingdom he is also reportedly well liked by world leaders
muqrin has been closely linked to abdullah and his policies of modernization and reform according to cordesman
but the succession plan isn't without its critics
<unk> mother does not have royal blood which is a sticking point for some people in saudi arabia
several of salman's sons also hold prominent positions
they include prince <unk> who in the one thousand nine hundred and eighty s became the first muslim astronaut and is now the president of saudi arabia's tourism authority
prince abdulaziz the deputy oil minister
and prince faisal the governor of the medina region
another son prince khaled was reportedly among the pilots who carried out the first airstrikes on isis positions in syria last year
details about salman's earlier life and upbringing weren't immediately available friday
but an official biography contained one <unk> about his youth
he had apparently memorized the quran by the age of ten it said
on tuesday isis released a video threatening to kill the two men kenji goto and haruna yukawa unless japan paid the group two hundred million dollar within seventy two hours
based on the time frame the japanese government estimated that the ultimatum expired at two fifty p.m. friday tokyo time and scrambled to secure the men's release
hours before the estimated deadline an isis spokesman told japanese broadcaster nhk that the group would release a statement soon about the hostages
that statement didn't come
when asked whether isis has been in negotiations with the japanese government the spokesman told nhk he wouldn't comment
isis claims the ransom amount is the same as the financial aid pledged by japanese prime minister shinzo abe to countries affected by the militant group
japanese officials have repeatedly stressed that their military which is constitutionally forbidden from taking action other than for self defense isn't involved in the international airstrikes against isis positions in syria and iraq
the abe pledge is for humanitarian purposes like helping refugees not military purposes japan says
in his communication with nhk the isis spokesman said the group is aware of what japan says and then he went on to call the japanese infidels for fighting with the group
it says it's doing its best to communicate with isis
it wants to secure the hostages safe release but it won't yield to threats
japanese chief cabinet secretary yoshihide suga said he was aware of reports that isis would soon make a statement
we are receiving many different pieces of information but as a government we can not really comment as to whether that information is authentic he said
caught in the middle are the two men goto and yukawa
as the apparent deadline approached goto's mother begged for her son's life
to all members of isis kenji is not the enemy of isis
please release him said the mother junko ishido
there is so little time left before the deadline
i have been just crying for the last three days filled with sadness
words fail to describe how i feel
kenji always has been a kind person ever since he was little
he was always saying i want to save the lives of children in war zones
leading japanese news organizations have reported citing unidentified government sources that goto's wife got an email in december from someone demanding eight million dollar to sixteen million dollar for her husband's return
the government is trying to confirm if that email came from isis the reports said
if so it could indicate the militant group is willing to accept a smaller ransom than the two hundred million dollar it had publicly demanded
but the question is what if anything japan is willing to give
isis has a ruthless track record
it has released videos touting the killing of five western hostages since august
abe has called isis ultimatum over the two japanese men's lives unacceptable and said the international community shouldn't give in to terrorists
but he and other government officials haven't explicitly ruled out paying a ransom
some details have emerged about what spurred the two japanese citizens to travel thousands of miles to the bloody syrian conflict
while they had different professions the two men knew and talked to each other said yukawa's friend nobuo kimoto
goto an experienced freelance journalist made a video in october near the turkish syrian border before he embarked on a perilous journey into isis controlled territory
it is my responsibility if something happens he explained
goto forty seven said he was determined to cover what was happening in the region
syrian people suffering three years and a half
it's enough he said
so i would like to get the story of what isis wants to do
alaaeddin al zaim who had worked with goto in syria previously says he warned him not to enter the isis stronghold of raqqa
i tell him it's not safe for you al zaim told cnn
but goto chose to go anyway saying i am not american i am not british
i'm japanese
i can go al zaim recalled
the aims and activities in syria of yukawa a forty two year old unemployed widower are murkier
he originally headed to the war ravaged country early last year with the aim of gaining combat and survival experience to bolster his plans to set up a private security company said his friend kimoto
there yukawa met goto who gave him insights on how to survive there kimoto said
he also introduced him to rebel fighters who are distinct from isis even though both are fighting against syrian president bashar al assad's forces
some of the rebels talked about their need for ambulances to shuttle the wounded
that plea spurred yukawa to start raising money for this cause after returning to japan according to kimoto
i felt a chill when he said after returning home he felt in syria he was really living a life kimoto said
he seems to have felt satisfaction being there and living together with the locals
yukawa went back to syria in july a trip that kimoto said he didn't know about at the time
kimoto said he had advised his friend to focus on building up his private security company

though the vote was largely symbolic as she had already lost her post it also carries a five year ban from politics
the news came hours after the attorney general's office announced that yingluck who was removed from office in may last year days before the military swept to power in a coup will face criminal charges over the affair
if found guilty she could face up to ten years in prison
the rice subsidy program introduced in two thousand and eleven pledged to pay farmers well above the market rate for their crop
but critics said it wasted large amounts of public funds trying to please rural voters hurting exports and leaving the government with large <unk> of rice it couldn't sell without losing money
she was eventually put under investigation by thailand's national anti corruption commission
in an address to the <unk> thursday yingluck denied any wrongdoing and questioned whether the impeachment vote was valid
the <unk> legitimacy in sending the impeachment case for the <unk> consideration is questionable since the constitution of two thousand and seven has been revoked
with the coup <unk> on may twenty two two thousand and fourteen she said
i am no longer prime minister since the constitutional court has already removed me thus there is essentially no position to <unk> me from
the legal grounds claimed by the <unk> were also <unk> as the target of <unk> me is to ban me from holding any political positions for five years which is a clear violation of my fundamental rights and liberties
but the bangkok post reported friday that many <unk> members were <unk> and found she was unable to clear up the accusations against her
they also backed the <unk> evidence against her
in a statement translated into english by her office yingluck said she would continue to fight to prove my innocence to the very end no matter what the outcome will be
she said the rice subsidy scheme was beneficial for the farmers and the country and that claims it lost money were wrong and motivated by political bias against her
i am not sad because i am the victim of this entire ordeal but i am sad for the rice farmers and all of the disadvantaged thai citizens whose lives will return to the vicious cycle of being poor debt ridden and being taken advantage of and most important of all being denied of their basic democratic rights under the rule of law she said
two weeks before the military coup last may a thai court ordered <unk> removal finding her guilty of violating the country's constitution in her reassignment of a senior security official in two thousand and eleven
that official was replaced by the then national police chief whose role in turn was given to <unk> <unk>
<unk> is the brother of the ex wife of <unk> <unk> <unk> brother who was overthrown as prime minister in a military coup in two thousand and six
<unk> is living in self imposed exile to avoid a corruption conviction
thailand has had a long relationship with tourism but now it's ready to take the next step
it feels it's time that tourists got to know it a little better
that anyway is the basic idea behind discover <unk> a newly launched marketing campaign that includes the promotion of twelve of the country's lesser visited areas
we're introducing new destinations because sixty seventy percents of thailand's tourists are repeat visitors says thai tourism minister <unk> <unk>
in order for them to return and hopefully stay longer and spend more we believe that we need to offer more activities and destinations
among the twelve being promoted is the ancient city of <unk> located about an <unk> drive from <unk> <unk>
we can see why
thai photographer <unk> <unk> has lived in <unk> for more than fifteen years and in that time has documented life in the city and its surrounding areas the province is also named <unk> which he shares in this gallery
unfortunately even with the hardships of living in a camp these kids are still some of the lucky ones
after all at least half of syrian refugee children aren't even in school
indeed if syrian refugees were a country they would have the lowest rate of educational enrollment in the world
and without access to quality education children here are at risk of not having the skills they need as adults
all this means that syria is facing a lost generation
why is all this happening
because the civil war is destroying syrian society
the united nations announced earlier this month that syrians are now the largest refugee population in the world more than seven point five million syrians are displaced internally while another three point two million are registered refugees in neighboring countries
that's nearly half of syria's total population
and while lebanon turkey jordan iraq and egypt have been remarkably generous hosts the influx is so large that it's changing some countries demographics with refugees comprising at least twenty percents of <unk> population ten percents of jordan's and ten to twenty percents of border areas in turkey according to the state department and u.n
meanwhile more than eighty percents of the refugees reside in urban areas not camps and so rely on urban services placing high demands on schools
all this is leaving education in crisis across the host countries
while each country officially allows syrian children access to the public education system barriers remain including school space shortages having to learn new languages transportation the need for children to work for their family's survival and bullying
in addition many are putting off school in the belief that their return to syria is imminent
this creates very real risks to the quality of education for both host country nationals and syrian children
the presence of refugees has meant crowded classrooms and constrained budgets and it leaves teachers managing students who are at different levels
continuous investment in these countries education systems is therefore important so that the quality of education doesn't fall backwards
sadly there's no end in sight for syria's civil war
and even when peace is re established it will take years before many syrians can return to their homes given the destroyed infrastructure and residual tensions within society
this isn't unique to the current situation
in <unk> refugee crises around the world the average time until refugees can return home is seventeen years according to the united nations
the responsibility for providing formal k twelve education for refugees lies primarily with the host governments some of which are taking loans to cover the deficits
but while much of the international assistance response has so far been humanitarian responding to urgent needs what's needed now is a transition toward development planning in which longer term sustainable solutions for education and other sectors are planned and <unk>
this means investing in building capacities of host country governments to provide education to these additional people in the future
donor funding will dry up over time and the host governments will need systems to manage the additional children they must educate
moving forward host countries and the international aid community should prioritize investment in access to quality education with additional attention to building infrastructure to expand school spaces understanding and addressing other barriers to access developing transportation options improving data systems expanding school monitoring and support and providing teacher training about refugee needs in the classroom
this will also constitute an investment in the longer term education development needs of the host countries meaning they'll benefit too
the suffering that has taken place in syria since the civil war started in two thousand and eleven has been almost unimaginable
but by investing in the country's future in this way the international community can help ensure education isn't another casualty of the war
and perhaps help lay the foundations for a brighter future
fences need to be <unk>
at least that's the views of republicans who understand changing demographics and realize the <unk> of <unk> a population that produces more than two million potential voters every four years and maintains a sizable presence in three battleground states
nevada florida and colorado
and yet in politics the first rule is that elected officials should always remember to take care of their base elements of which for the gop <unk> on attempts by republican politicians to engage in <unk> by reaching out to hispanic voters and <unk> their tone on immigration
it's mostly about <unk> and resentment over seeing elected officials who used to woo them going off to woo somewhere else
nonetheless going forward republicans aren't sure what to do and this <unk> stems from three things
first it is an article of faith among republicans particularly those in the house of representatives that the voters who turned out in november and put the gop back in control of both houses of congress want them to derail what the right wing <unk> describes as obama's executive amnesty
that's what house republicans attempted to do recently when they used amendments to a spending bill for the department of homeland security to cut off funding for the administration's plan to shield millions of illegal immigrants from deportation
the tactic divides republicans and sets up a confrontation with gop senate colleagues who are expected to <unk> the measure
it's also a largely symbolic effort that will in the end not amount to much besides giving house republicans something to point to down the road when they go home to their districts
they're probably counting on the fact that while some of their constituents will be angry that obama's executive action survived others will give conservative lawmakers an a for effort
second the republican establishment and other moderates both in washington and at the state level are determined to win back hispanic support and not further <unk> or alienate those voters unless the gop wants to turn up <unk> in the next several presidential elections
republicans don't have to turn themselves inside out but they need to deal with immigration with more honesty <unk> and common sense
they should stop attacking immigrants because they're frustrated by the government's response to illegal immigration
and they should pick on people their own size by going after employers
finally they need to adopt a zero tolerance policy the next time a republican official says something racist or <unk>
too many republicans are cowards when it comes to acknowledging the role that ethnicity plays in the current anxiety that many americans feel about managing immigration and securing the borders
and third according to polls nearly ninety percents of hispanic voters support obama's executive action and about eighty percents of hispanic voters say the gop should not interfere with it which sets up the possibility that hispanics will punish republicans if they continue to try to dismantle the policy
this doesn't mean that all or even most hispanics want open borders
it's hard to make that argument given that at the moment most border patrol agents are hispanic
but what i hear from hispanics is that while they're fed up with how both parties play politics with the immigration issue they're really furious at republicans for that party's efforts to <unk> this issue in order to scare up votes from white people
hispanics say they want employers punished and not just the immigrants who can't defend themselves
and they tell me despite republicans denying that race and ethnicity are factors in the debate they don't believe for one minute that americans would be this shook up if the majority of illegal immigrants were coming from canada sweden or great britain instead of mexico el salvador and guatemala
so how do republicans <unk> those right wing elements of their base and undo obama's executive action on immigration without further <unk> hispanics
it won't be easy
<unk> can be brutal
and while some political parties never learn hispanics never forget
republicans could <unk> decide that they don't need hispanic support in two thousand and sixteen and beyond and so they don't have to worry about alienating them
or they could roll the dice and count on the assumption that despite what the polls say not all hispanics support obama's executive action because they oppose illegal immigration as much as other americans
for now republicans seem to be going down a third road and simply ignoring the practical impact that their attempted rollback of obama's executive action would have on the millions of illegal immigrants who if the gop were successful would suddenly be once again eligible for deportation
republicans don't want those people to be the focus of this discussion and they'd prefer the attention to be on the validity of executive action itself
that is where they're shifting the conversation
that's a weak attempt to dodge the issue
hispanics are closer to this issue than other americans because more of them have first hand contact with illegal immigrants
they know this debate isn't some abstract discussion of competing priorities
they know it's about people and detached politicians deciding who stays and who goes
that sounds like a fun game
well next year hispanics will get to play
they'll help decide which elected officials stay in office and which ones go home for good
christopher lee cornell twenty has been charged with attempting to kill government employees solicitation to commit a crime and possession of a firearm
the first two charges are punishable by up to twenty years in prison while the third charge can carry a possible sentence of up to five years behind bars
authorities say cornell planned to set off bombs at the u.s. capitol and then open fire on people as they fled
he came to the fbi's attention several months ago after posting about his support for violent jihad on social media according to a criminal complaint
the fbi launched an undercover operation with the help of a person who began cooperating in exchange for favorable treatment on his criminal exposure on an unrelated case
cornell allegedly told that source he had been in contact with persons overseas and that he had aligned himself with isis
he did not think he would receive specific authorization to conduct a terrorist attack in the united states but stated that he wanted to go forward with violent jihad and <unk> that this would be their way of supporting isil the complaint said using another name for isis
according to the complaint cornell wrote
i believe that we should just wage jihad under our own orders and plan attacks and everything
i believe we should meet up and make our own group in alliance with the islamic state here and plan operations ourselves
calls to modernize his kingdom were constant
so too were objections from hard line conservatives who <unk> at change
supporters hailed abdullah who died friday at age ninety as a reformer
and in the united states leaders have long described him as a close ally in the middle east who played a key role in bringing stability to the region
he famously held hands with president george w. bush as the two leaders met in texas in two thousand and five
with the wealth of his oil rich nation behind him abdullah <unk> far reaching influence both inside and outside saudi arabia
as the u.s. led campaign against isis in iraq and syria ramped up his leadership was a game changer <unk> <unk> a professor of political science at emirates university told cnn last year
it was king abdullah who put all the moral the political weight behind the international coalition to stop isis's momentum he said
u.s. secretary of state john kerry described abdullah as a revered leader around the world
he was so proud of the kingdom's journey kerry said in a statement a brave partner in fighting violent extremism who proved just as important as a proponent of peace
under abdullah's leadership the country slowly <unk> al qaeda capturing or killing its leaders in the kingdom forcing the remnants underground and <unk> radical preachers
in two thousand and five abdullah launched a campaign through the country's media and its mosques to educate saudi citizens about the danger of extremism
at the same time the king unlike some of his predecessors began investing the country's oil wealth in creating jobs for the future
a massive building program called king abdullah economic city was one example and an acknowledgment that oil money wouldn't last forever
the king focused on ramping up education too
king abdullah university of science and technology was designed to be the first <unk> university in the country
some of his more conservative ministers his half brothers <unk> at his changes
they weren't the only saudis disappointed with his leadership
many women had hoped for greater independence under his rule
but their dreams were not realized during his lifetime
he initiated forums for women to debate issues but failed in the face of opposition to give them real freedom
under saudi arabia's strict rules women can not marry leave the country go to school or open bank accounts without permission from a male guardian who usually is the father or husband
much of public life is <unk> by gender and women are not allowed to drive
even as he ran up against limits to what he could achieve inside saudi arabia beyond its borders abdullah saw the kingdom's stature grow
it was the only arab nation with a seat at the g twenty and also became the lead arab nation in the u.s. led coalition to eradicate isis in iraq and syria
abdullah bolstered the desert kingdom's defense forces with a massive one hundred and fifty billion dollar infusion and he backed egypt's military rulers who ousted the muslim brotherhood from power
a spokesman for united nations secretary general ban ki moon praised abdullah's efforts to address regional and international challenges at a time of turmoil and rapid change and to promote dialogue among the world's faiths
u.s. president barack obama pointed to abdullah's work advancing the arab peace initiative which attempts to solve the long simmering conflict between israel and palestine
king abdullah left a tangible legacy that can still point the way toward peace in the middle east the u.n. secretary general's spokesman said
in two thousand and ten <unk> called king abdullah one of the world's ten most respected leaders praising his efforts to lift his <unk> country from the dark ages
he's given the go ahead to modernize schools has appointed women to high office and invested in science and technology education and nuclear power initiatives
he's also proven a stalwart ally against islamic extremism delivering a much applauded speech in mecca that called on muslims to embrace the spirit of tolerance moderation and balance the <unk> article said
but not everyone felt like abdullah deserved his <unk> moniker
another headline in foreign policy magazine that year described him this way
those who predicted the saudi monarch would bring real change to the kingdom had it wrong
his real goal has been to tighten his family's grip on power
despite the new levels of openness enjoyed by saudi citizens abdullah is not leading the kingdom on the path to political liberalism
just the opposite
while making small social and economic concessions the king is in fact turning the clock back in arabia using his popularity to confront <unk> and restore the kind of unchecked authority his family enjoyed in the one thousand nine hundred and seventy s <unk> c. jones an associate professor of history at <unk> wrote in an analysis for the magazine
ali al ahmed a former saudi political prisoner told cnn on thursday that it isn't accurate to portray abdullah as a reformer
under abdullah's rule he said political prisoners were <unk> punished and extremism flourished in saudi arabia even as leaders claimed to oppose it
it's the epicenter of extremism of terrorism of funding terrorism
reforms in saudi arabia do not exist
this is an absolute monarchy let's be honest al ahmed said
this is an absolute monarchy where the government policies are controlled by one family
they decide everything
recent events have highlighted that recovering flight data can be costly and difficult when an accident occurs in a remote area outside radar coverage the ntsb wrote in the letter on thursday to the federal aviation administration
malaysian airlines flight three hundred and seventy remains the most notable recent missing plane and its disappearance has driven aviation authorities worldwide to consider changes to how aircraft are tracked
the boeing seven hundred and seventy seven is thought to have crashed in the south indian ocean far from land and far from radar coverage
search crews continue looking for it but so far have found no wreckage or sign of the two hundred and thirty nine people on board
thursday's recommendations address commercial airline commuter and charter flights and stem from a forum held last fall on flight data and locator technology
planes certified to fly long distances over water and which currently have flight data and cockpit voice recorders would now be required to have a way to transmit location <unk> so they can be <unk> within six nautical miles after a crash
currently planes flying over oceans outside of radar coverage may not transmit location information frequently enough to send investigators to a precise crash site
<unk> new proposed requirements call for low frequency locating devices to be attached to the body of planes flying these long distances over oceans
the locator <unk> would emit a signal for at least ninety days three times longer than the current requirement
military and search and rescue ships would be able to hone in on these signals and find the wreckage
new planes that currently have black boxes and are designed to fly for hours over water would now be required to allow data recovery that is accessible without finding the physical boxes
this could include a recorder that breaks away from the wreckage and floats or recorders that stream data when a mishap happens in the air
the streaming black boxes would be required to start transmitting in the event of a so called triggering event such as a malfunction
they would keep sending information in real time while attempting to feed all previously recorded data as well
either of the two systems would provide investigators more timely access to information and offer valuable insight into the circumstances near the end of an accident flight the ntsb writes in its recommendations
the board also proposed the faa identify ways to keep people from <unk> flight recorders and require all new planes to have black boxes that can not be easily disabled
in some planes pilots can easily pull a circuit breaker which cuts power to the recorders and could potentially stop them
additionally the ntsb renewed its call for video cameras in the cockpit with the footage designed to survive a crash
this would allow investigators to review a visual record of everything that was going on in the cockpit rather than just the audio recordings they have now
this call for image recorders echoes a similar recommendation the ntsb first made fifteen years ago but which the faa did not implement
these new recommendations will now go to the faa for consideration
if any or all of the recommendations are accepted after a ninety day period during which the faa can comment it still could be years before they are implemented due to the airline certification safety and engineering considerations
the faa will carefully review all of the <unk> recommendations and will send the board a formal response an faa statement sent to cnn thursday night by spokeswoman laura brown said
the faa continues to work with industry and our international partners on policy and guidance for advanced technologies that may be useful in aircraft accident investigations
it also noted the faa is working on developing voluntary standards for airlines who want to install cockpit image recorders or <unk> black boxes and says underwater locator <unk> will be extended to ninety days by two thousand and twenty
this dramatic scene may sound like one of the more brutal passages of the old testament but the book of exodus this is not
instead it's the strange reality unfolding in the arctic town of kiruna northern sweden
a nearby iron ore mine <unk> main source of income and employment for more than a century has begun to <unk> on the city in recent years
small cracks have also begun to show on the streets in business and residential areas
a detailed analysis by <unk> has predicted that the these <unk> will only get worse as it attempts to access the most difficult to reach minerals
according to erika <unk> of <unk> the remaining iron ore bodies are located directly under the city
this creates a problem as the law and the company's own policy prohibits mining under populated areas
when the mines initially opened it made sense to build housing near the workplaces <unk> said
however no one could have imagined that over one hundred and twenty years later we would be mining ore a <unk> below ground and that this would have a significant impact on the communities in which we operate
the people of kiruna have been aware of these developments since two thousand and four when <unk> sent local residents a letter detailing the severity of the situation
in the period since they have been forced to wrestle with an <unk> dilemma
either the mine which employs around four thousand local people closes down and the city loses its primary source of income or it continues to operate and a large part of kiruna is <unk> off and its inhabitants are forced to move a new location
the problem is <unk> <unk> by goran cars head of development at the kiruna municipality
the city is the mine and the mine is the city cars said
we have lived together for one hundred years and we have a huge dependence on each other
without the mine the town would die
after much debate and an international competition to flesh out what the new kiruna would look like the option to move won the day
over the course of the next twenty years a new town center municipal buildings and three thousand homes will be constructed two miles away
when the project is finished roughly six thousand of <unk> twenty three thousand residents will have been relocated according to data provided by <unk>
people forced to depart over this period will have their property purchased from them by the mining firm
they will then choose between investing in one of the newly built homes or if they prefer <unk> sticks for <unk> new
on top of this around twenty structures of cultural and architectural significance will be taken down brick by brick and rebuilt in a new more stable location
understandably such an ambitious task has drawn attention from around the globe
the idea of having a city and then moving it has never happened before cars said
we are unique
among the buildings being moved is the local church which was voted the most beautiful building in sweden two thousand and one
the bell tower from the existing town hall will also be removed and placed in the new town square
the incremental nature of the move has led to kiruna being dubbed the <unk> town
building work began last march and has been progressing at a gentle pace ever since
as things stand the foundations have been laid for the new city hall while one business has been shuttered in the old town according to <unk>
other buildings slated for construction include a new train station town square hotels offices and schools
i think that we can make a lot of improvements
more modern houses and buildings <unk> said
for architecture firm white <unk> ab however the opportunity to <unk> a one hundred year old town goes way beyond the possibility of <unk> some eye catching new buildings
co lead architect <unk> <unk> envisions a sleek modern development that embodies the most cutting edge concepts of design and urban planning
he describes a town that <unk> the spectacular nature of the surrounding region and a new people friendly town center built entirely from scratch
there will be more social meeting places more cafes and more scope for cultural activities than are currently available in the existing kiruna <unk> adds
for the residents of kiruna such changes are generally perceived positively cars explained
the current city has no town center and very few areas for gathering or for putting on events
it also has a long held demographic problem of retaining female residents many of whom prefer to move elsewhere for work
these are all problems the new design for the new kiruna seeks to solve
yet there remain concerns about the psychological and emotional impacts moving a city will have on its residents
some older people even worry whether they will be able to afford home in the new kiruna although the local authorities are adamant that a solution will be found if anyone finds themselves in such a situation
the unique community feeling is something the architects hope to maintain
according to <unk> this project is as much a question of identity and what will make people feel like they are at home
social <unk> <unk> <unk> has been drafted in by white <unk> ab to help deal with these issues
she describes the importance of not completely <unk> existing landmarks no matter how insignificant they are
people can hold strong <unk> memories over items as seemingly meaningless as a street name or a park bench believes <unk>
a <unk> named kiruna portal has been set up that will allow people to identify items that they would like to see moved to the new town
this could be something as small as a particular brick that holds a special memory or as big as the existing bell tower
the kiruna <unk> meanwhile an event scheduled to begin in the city in years to come will be a nostalgic celebration about what the city was but also what it will become
while far from perfect <unk> believes these projects will help ease people's feelings about the transition
it will also serve to emphasize how unique the residents of kiruna and their city really are
there's this mutual relationship which is quite interesting that i don't see in other projects when you move cities <unk> said
when slums are cleared its obvious who has the power
i mean the decision is made and people are moved
but in kiruna there is this mutual between the town and the mine
so it has to be done in this respectful way

for the first time in a decade chicago's o'hare topped atlanta's hartsfield jackson in total flights by more than thirteen thousand according to new stats from the u.s. federal aviation administration
hey this is important
it's about who's no
one
it's about bragging rights
chicago <unk> its place as the world's busiest airport chicago mayor rahm emanuel said in a statement thursday crediting new airline routes newly relocated businesses and the city's strong economy
but atlanta's hartsfield jackson remains no
one in annual passenger traffic
spokesman reese <unk> said the airport is projected to top ninety six million passengers for two thousand and fourteen compared with o'hare which handled sixty six point seven million in two thousand and thirteen
that put o'hare in fifth place globally for passengers
with our friends in chicago it's always a little bit of friendly rivalry <unk> said
our operations folks are probably getting <unk> by their operations folks for edging us out
but you know we're all one aviation system so when o'hare does well other airports including ours do well
<unk> twenty four
a day in the life of the world's busiest airport
so really which airport is the busiest
which is more challenging for an airport
handling more airplanes or more passengers
each has its own contributing factors
o'hare has eight <unk>
atlanta five
atlanta tends to have more sunshine than chicago which may cut weather delays and cancellations
o'hare hosts many regional airlines but <unk> said atlanta carriers are adding more airliners with higher passenger capacity
so when you have that of course that means you don't have as many <unk> and landings <unk> said
let's stop for a minute and remind ourselves that these two airports are called upon to perform something that's really quite amazing
with incredible attention to safety they serve nearly a million flights a year and tens of millions of passengers
large international airports are among the world's most complicated facilities with constantly moving components that require detailed attention
being the busiest on any level is a true badge of honor
emanuel said the victory comes from chicago being the top metro area for foreign direct investment and its record growth in international tourism
so how do you define the world's busiest airport
what's the definition of busy
<unk> makes it pretty simple
actively doing something
from a traveling consumer perspective traditionally passenger traffic has been the key <unk> when talking about the busiest airports
that's because the faa takeoff and landing stats include military and other <unk> flights
for example an airport that includes a hub for a cargo delivery outfit such as ups airlines in louisville kentucky is going to have more <unk> and landings that don't include passengers
although two thousand and fourteen global stats are pending year to date figures suggest that atlanta will still be the busiest airport in the world based on passenger traffic according to airports council international
in two thousand and thirteen <unk> said beijing ranked no
two in passengers with eighty three point seven million
london's heathrow ranked no
three in two thousand and thirteen but <unk> says dubai is poised to surpass heathrow in international passengers in two thousand and fourteen
the rising passenger traffic at dubai's airport shows how <unk> <unk> has moved <unk> in the past decade resulting in double digit growth rates said dr. rafael <unk> <unk> economics director
airlines he said are scheduling more fights out of dubai that use wide body long haul planes that carry more passengers
as for airport <unk> and landings in two thousand and thirteen it ranks globally like this
meanwhile these new numbers appear to be throwing more fuel on the fire in the rivalry between atlanta hartsfield jackson and chicago o'hare
we'll let them hold the mantle this year said <unk>
we'll come back swinging next year and we'll see what happens

shannon maureen conley nineteen now prefers to go by <unk> she told cnn during a visit to her <unk> the day before her sentencing
the name means female servant of allah she said
conley initially took the name <unk> after converting to islam
she will become one of the first americans sentenced for conspiracy to support isis
conley attracted national attention last year after authorities arrested her at denver international airport
investigators said she told them she was going to turkey to await word from an isis member in syria a man she met on the internet and planned to marry
according to court documents she intended to become a nurse in an isis camp
she is a colorado certified nurse's aide
here are three key questions about her case
conley seemed friendly and nervous thursday sometimes hesitant to say anything that would upset her attorney who wasn't present
she was happy to talk about less sensitive matters such as her new <unk>
a tight <unk> to her dark brown hair arranged in four or five rows
she wasn't wearing a muslim headscarf
oh this is for tomorrow conley said about her new <unk> for the sentencing in federal court
she declined to go into detail however about her pending punishment in which she is facing a maximum of five years in prison and a two hundred and fifty thousand dollar fine
she pleaded guilty last year to conspiring to provide material support to a designated foreign terrorist group
i'm in a vulnerable place right now and it would be stupid of me to talk to you when i'm vulnerable she told cnn during a video conference visit in the jefferson county detention facility in golden which didn't allow any on camera <unk>
she didn't want to talk about her crime
no comment she said
didn't you learn your lesson last time
that was a reference to cnn's prior <unk> visit in which conley said her attorney had advised her against talking to the media about her case
but conley did acknowledge a measure of transformation since her arrest and jailing pending her sentence
that's why she changed her name she said
i'm a different person than when i came in she explained
she was clueless
she's just a teenager young with a big mouth the mother told cnn last year
i think another time another place she would just be another kid with a big mouth
isis is extremely savvy with its internet propaganda and her daughter was a victim of the jihadist group <unk> conley said
the mother worries about other <unk> young americans
i hope that justice rather than fear will prevail the mother said
she and her husband john were aware of their daughter's conversion to islam but didn't know about her interest in extreme islam or jihad
john conley reportedly caught his daughter talking to her <unk> a thirty two year old tunisian man on skype
the couple asked for the father's blessing but he said no
on april one the father called the fbi to report that he had found her ticket for an april eight flight to turkey on his desk
the fbi and joint terrorism task force were tipped off to conley's suspicious activity in november two thousand and thirteen when the pastor and security director of faith bible chapel told local police that conley was wandering around campus and taking notes court papers said
the church's main campus in <unk> was the scene of a <unk> fatal shooting in two thousand and seven
when church staff confronted conley about her notes she allegedly told them
why is the church worried about a terrorist attack
and that terrorists are
not allowed to kill aging adults and little children according to court papers
church officials asked her not to return
in an interview with the fbi the following month she said she joined the u.s. army explorers to receive military training and intended to use the firearm skills to go overseas to wage jihad court papers said
over five months authorities interviewed her seven times
conley told them that jihad must be waged to protect muslim nations court papers said
she preferred to wage jihad overseas to be with jihad fighters
conley told investigators she would be defending muslims on the muslim homeland against people who are trying to kill them according to court documents
conley told her parents that her knowledge of islam was based solely on research she had conducted on the internet
four days before conley's april eight flight federal investigators again questioned her about whether she would engage in actual combat on the isis battlefield
if it was absolutely necessary then yes
i wouldn't like it
but i would do it she told authorities according to court papers

prince salman bin abdulaziz was appointed as the new king state television reported
the announcement of abdullah's death comes several weeks after the state run saudi press agency said he was suffering from pneumonia and had been admitted to the hospital
services will be held friday afternoon at the imam turki bin abdullah grand mosque in riyadh and many world leaders are likely to pay their respects
jordan's king abdullah cut short his visit to davos and is heading to riyadh according to a jordanian government source
king abdullah's life spanned from before the birth of modern saudi arabia through its emergence as a critical force within the global economy and a leader among arab and islamic nations u.s. president barack obama said in a statement
he praised abdullah's role in sponsoring the arab peace initiative which attempts to solve the long simmering conflict between israel and palestine
this is a sad day
the united states has lost a friend and the kingdom of saudi arabia the middle east and the world has lost a revered leader u.s. secretary of state john kerry said in a statement
he was so proud of the kingdom's journey a brave partner in fighting violent extremism who proved just as important as a proponent of peace
king abdullah became king of the oil rich nation a key u.s. ally in the middle east in august two thousand and five
but he had been running saudi arabia since one thousand nine hundred and ninety six after his half brother king <unk> stroke
in the context of the kingdom's conservative circles abdullah was seen as reformer and often came up against the more hard line clerics
since <unk> to the throne abdullah took steps toward broader freedoms and invested some of the country's vast oil wealth in large scale education and infrastructure projects
he was really quite extraordinary figure
he was probably the most progressive and liberal minded king of saudi arabia since king faisal which is a long time ago in the early one thousand nine hundred and seventy s cnn's fareed zakaria said about abdullah who he described as much loved
i had the opportunity to meet with him once and what you got a sense of was somebody who really was determined to move his country forward zakaria said
it's a conservative country and a conservative society and he kept emphasizing that to me but he was very clear in the direction he wanted to go
however resistance from conservative factions hindered some of his efforts leaving many women in particular disappointed by a lack of progress toward greater independence
under abdullah's leadership the country slowly <unk> al qaeda capturing or killing its leaders in the kingdom forcing the remnants underground and <unk> radical preachers
it also took a more prominent role in international affairs
last year it became the lead arab nation in a u.s. led coalition to eradicate the <unk> isis group in iraq and syria
analysts are predicting a smooth political transition despite the many challenges facing saudi arabia including iran the rise of isis the crisis in yemen and the drop in oil prices
saudi arabia has sixteen percents of the world's known oil reserves according to the u.s. energy information administration
the country is widely seen as the leader of opec and has a large influence on energy prices and political stability in the middle east
remember the last time the price of oil fell like this the soviet union collapsed said zakaria
that said the successor is a very competent man
he added
i don't expect any major shift but it marks a big change and we'll have to see what the new king is like
oh don't take offense
up until a few days ago when the deflategate scandal broke we were all dummies when it came to the <unk> of nfl ball rules
hell let's be honest
we were <unk>
now we're learning all sorts of fancy things about the league's regulations and how teams and referees handle footballs before and during a game
for instance did you know the ball must be a <unk> <unk>
and did you know that before today the term <unk> <unk> had appeared on cnn dot com only four times in its history
perhaps that's for the better
anyway you've got questions and as so often is the case we have answers
let's get pumped up
what on earth is going on
the nfl is investigating the new england patriots to determine why eleven of the twelve game balls they provided for sunday's afc championship game were under inflated by about two pounds per square inch each
the pats supplied their own balls
isn't that letting the fox watch the <unk> house
<unk> for lack of a more elaborate answer
yes
according to nfl regulations each team provides a dozen balls to the referee for testing two hours and fifteen minutes before kickoff
the home team also supplies twelve backup balls and for outdoor games the visiting team has the option of bringing another twelve balls
in addition the ball manufacturer in this case wilson ships eight more balls in what the nfl scientifically terms a special box directly to the referee
the box is opened two hours and fifteen minutes before the game and the referee marks each ball with a k to <unk> it for kicking
espn writer kate <unk> pointed out the curiosity of the regulation in an appearance on around the horn on wednesday
when <unk> played college basketball she said the referees brought out ncaa supplied balls an hour before the game
those balls were used for <unk> and the game and they were not to leave the court she said
if the ncaa has such a rule for women's basketball games she posited how can the <unk> profitable nfl not provide its own game balls
a fine question
who's in charge of making sure balls are up to <unk>
the referee shall be the sole judge as to whether all balls offered for play comply with these <unk>
a pump is to be <unk> by the home club and the balls shall remain under the supervision of the referee until they are delivered to the ball attendant just prior to the start of the game nfl rules state
the ball attendant <unk> the footballs to the field and ball boys keep them on the <unk> espn reports
ball boys are usually vetted by teams and paid by the nfl and can be sons or daughters of team employees the network reports
so it was the ball boy
yes with a <unk> in the <unk>
that's a joke
if the nfl had <unk> a culprit cnn wouldn't need to devote writers to <unk> the league's game ball rules
what other rules <unk> to a game ball
as mentioned it has to be a <unk> <unk> which in <unk> terms means shaped like a football and it has to be signed by commissioner roger goodell as opposed to say kate <unk> or weird al <unk>
it should have between twelve point five and thirteen point five pounds of air per square inch and weigh fourteen to fifteen ounces
it should have a long axis of eleven to eleven point two five inches a long circumference of twenty eight to twenty eight point five inches and a short circumference of twenty one to twenty one point two five inches
and perhaps most importantly it needs to be constructed of a <unk> bladder encased in pebble grained leather of natural tan color
so no purple footballs
why would someone <unk> the balls
it supposedly makes them easier to grip for the quarterback and receivers
that would've been especially important in the wet conditions in which the afc championship was played
is it always an advantage
<unk> unclear
green bay packers quarterback aaron rodgers allegedly once told commentator and former quarterback phil <unk> that he could get a better grip on an over inflated ball
how was the issue even raised
in the second half of sunday's game indianapolis colts linebacker <unk> jackson intercepted patriots quarterback tom brady
according to <unk> he took the ball to his team's equipment staff which then informed head coach chuck <unk> who told general manager ryan <unk> who told nfl director of football operations mike <unk> who told the officials on the field
this should remind you of that kindergarten game where you sat in a circle <unk> things in your classmates ears to demonstrate how messages are lost as they're conveyed from one person to the next
thus it's entirely possible jackson told the equipment staff he wanted to go for pizza after the game and by the time it got to the officials we had deflategate
what about the wing official and umpire who spot the ball before each play
wouldn't they have noticed
<unk> you would think so
has this ever happened before
there are lots of tales of ball manipulation <unk> in the wake of deflategate but one particular story stands out
in two thousand and twelve the university of southern california which kind of has this thing for cheating was accused of under inflating balls used in a game against the oregon <unk>
the school was <unk> and fined and a student manager was <unk> when he conceded that he had under inflated the balls after the officials had approved them
the unnamed student said he did it all by his <unk> and no other <unk> coach staff member or administrator had any knowledge of his <unk>
there have been numerous reports that cold weather can diminish ball pressure which would normally be <unk> for the boston area
except that it was fifty one degrees in <unk> massachusetts at kickoff
is it possible patriots coach bill belichick knew
outside of massachusetts the general public puts belichick somewhere on par with <unk> <unk> so you'll find no shortage of people who say oh most definitely especially after <unk>
the coach says however in my entire coaching career i have never talked to any player staff member about football air pressure
asked about it monday on a boston radio show the three time super bowl winner responded i don't even respond to stuff like this
he also responded by calling the accusation ridiculous
on thursday he told reporters he didn't alter the balls and assured them i've always played by the rules
at least one football icon has his doubts that <unk> <unk> lesser half was not <unk>
in one of the most damning non accusations in history hall of fame coach john madden told the sports <unk> he believed belichick was clueless about the ball pressure but i can see and you hate to make examples of what you can see because that sounds like you are accusing someone but i can see that being between the quarterback and the equipment guy
he also said that's something that wouldn't be driven by a coach or just the equipment guy
nobody not even the head coach would do anything to the football unilaterally such as adjust the amount of pressure in a ball without the quarterback not knowing
it would have to be the <unk> idea
what to make of that
no idea but they did name the greatest video game the world has ever known after the dude
has the rest of the team spoken up
several patriots have called the controversy stupid and accused the media of fueling the controversy
do the pats <unk> the win if they're found guilty
ridiculously unlikely but they could be fined and docked a draft pick
after <unk> the league took away a patriots first round draft pick fined the team two hundred and fifty thousand dollar and fined <unk> five hundred thousand dollar but don't expect anything that serious in deflategate
could the ball pressure really have played that large a factor
similarly unlikely
the pats won forty five seven and twenty eight of their points came in the second half after the game officials had pumped the balls back up to their regulation pressure
you make the call
then why is this such a big deal
see earlier remark regarding belichick and <unk>
also there's this game coming up two sundays from now called the super bowl
the case of raif badawi has garnered international headlines and global outrage
badawi started a blog called free saudi liberals in two thousand and eight to encourage discussion about islam particularly the intrusion of the nation's religious police in saudis personal lives
he was officially charged with adopting liberal thought founding a liberal website and insulting islam
a jeddah court convicted him of insulting islam and handed down a ten year prison term and ordered that be whipped one thousand times
badawi received his first fifty lashes in the second week in january and was taken back to prison
he was supposed to be beaten again the third week but saudi officials postponed that due to medical advice the <unk> wife said
on wednesday a medical committee of about eight doctors assessed badawi at king fahd hospital in jeddah and determined he was too injured to withstand the beatings this week according to amnesty
instead of continuing to torment raif badawi by dragging out his ordeal with repeated assessments the authorities should publicly announce an end to his flogging and release him immediately and unconditionally said said boumedouha deputy director of amnesty international's middle east and north africa program
raif badawi is still at risk
there is no way of knowing whether the saudi arabian authorities will disregard the medical advice and allow the flogging to go ahead boumedouha said
<unk>
has saudi arabia bought the world's silence on human rights abuses
since then millions of high school and college <unk> have heard the same <unk> <unk> a not so gentle reminder to live up to their potential kid you <unk> move mountains
mixed with warnings about loneliness and uncertainty
it's a children's book as most dr. seuss books are but its messages have resonated through a quarter century because adults love it too said philip nel director of the program in children's literature at kansas state university
children's books possess an enormous amount of wisdom for the adults mature enough to recognize it he said
here are a few facts about oh the places you'll go
and its legacy
dr. seuss knew it would be the last book he published
geisel was writing and <unk> oh the places you'll go
in the final years of his life as he battled cancer
other seuss books have emerged since his death in one thousand nine hundred and ninety one but this was the last he had a hand in
it was his <unk> song and he knew it was his <unk> song nel said
it's a career <unk> in a lot of ways both visually and <unk> in the messages and the images
though it presents plenty of <unk> optimism and will you succeed
yes
you will indeed
it references dark times and <unk>
i'm afraid that some times you'll play lonely games too
games you can't win cause you'll play against you
geisel wrote from experience
after a successful career in advertising his first book and to think that i saw it on <unk> street was famously rejected multiple times
some projects in print and on screen simply never took off
in his personal life he faced illness and the suicide of his first wife
the darkness of the book is what makes the optimism credible nel said
geisel was known to be shy but would be <unk> to know that his words still have meaning now said susan <unk> president of licensing and marketing at dr. seuss enterprises
he was deliberate about what his last words to the world would be
you can feel him saying wait i have one more thing to say she said
listen to me
this is important
oh the places you'll go
rose to the <unk> list shortly after it was released in one thousand nine hundred and ninety and continues to pop up there most every spring as high school and college <unk> transition to a new phase of life
twenty five years and more than ten million copies later it's the top selling dr. seuss book
the company it keeps at the top
beloved early reading books like green eggs and ham and the cat in the hat perennial holiday read how the <unk> stole christmas
and books with a message and a movie like the <unk> and <unk> hears a who
its success isn't exactly a surprise said <unk> <unk> vice president and publisher of random house children's books
it was published the year she began her career at random house and she remember the buzz around the book even then
people knew it was special <unk> said
but ten million is crazy
the main character is you and you and you and you
passages in the cat in the hat and the <unk> both slip into the second person to make a point to readers but geisel made the main character of oh the places you'll go
a person called you who <unk> happens to be well you
that makes the book about the reader and puts the reader in the position of the character nel said
it's a <unk>
see yourself as the character
take action
dr. seuss had already been a major player in children's literature for decades but this was an early entry into a burgeoning category
children's stories that appeal to adults <unk> said
this is almost a self help book
people forget that it has pages that really acknowledge that things will be tough some times she said
sit down
read this book
it will be ok
as geisel himself put it i never write for children
i write for people
the number of places you'll go is growing
what started as a beloved graduation gift has spread into sort of an all purpose greeting card shared with a personal <unk> during any period of transition from baby showers to big moves
this month random house will publish a twenty five th anniversary edition of oh
the places you'll go
this year it will release a baby <unk> version oh baby the places you'll go
and a full color journal filled with quotes from the book
on march two <unk> birthday dr. seuss enterprises will launch <unk> dot com which calls for children age five to eighteen to share stories of how they're moving mountains in science technology engineering arts and math
they'll award scholarships and trips to some top students
there's never been a film version but kansas state university's nel said geisel hoped there would be an adaptation maybe something famous as famous can be with the whole wide world watching you win on tv
for his part nel said it's a remarkable book but he hasn't given it as a graduation gift
it's not that it's not good nel said
it's that everybody i would give it to someone has has already given it to them
it involves an investigation into the deadliest terror attack in argentina's history modern geopolitics alleged <unk> a puzzling death and a dose of paranoia
if you are unfamiliar with the story
last week a special prosecutor investigating the one thousand nine hundred and ninety four bombing of a jewish community center in buenos aires filed a report alleging that the president foreign minister and other officials conspired to cover up iran's involvement in the attack which killed eighty five
the prosecutor alberto nisman was invited to testify about his allegations before congress on monday
but on the eve of his testimony nisman was found dead inside his apartment
he died of a gunshot wound to the temple
a gun and a shell casing were found near his body
the apartment was locked from the inside
at first glance a suicide
but the untimely death raised suspicions immediately
a poll by the firm <unk> of more than four hundred <unk> found that seventy percents of them believed that nisman was murdered
some eighteen percents believed he took his own life and twelve percents didn't have an opinion
in a statement she called it the suicide was not a suicide
it is an about face from her position just days before
her first statement on nisman's death was a rejection of the prosecutor's allegations and a reflection on what was it that led a person to make the terrible decision to take his own life
two things happened after that
the prosecutor looking into nisman's death said that no gunpowder residue was found on his hands as would be likely if he pulled the trigger
second the locksmith who helped nisman's mother gain access into the apartment cast doubt on reports that the door could have been opened only from inside
to the contrary someone could have gained entry with something as simple as a wire the locksmith said
anybody could have opened it he told a swarm of reporters after giving a statement to investigators
while fernandez now considers that nisman did not commit suicide she still believes that his allegations against her government are false
nisman was not a hack with an agenda against the president but a naive investigator who was used by others who fed him false information fernandez said
the criminal complaint by prosecutor nisman was never in itself the true plot against the government fernandez wrote
his report <unk> like a house of cards she wrote and nisman probably never knew he was being fed false information
the real plot against the government was his death which came after he accused her government of a cover up to protect iranian suspects in the bombing fernandez wrote
they used him while he was alive and then they needed him dead she wrote
it's that sad and terrible
nisman's report promised to provide evidence of the existence of a sophisticated criminal plot deliberately <unk> to cover up and provide impunity to the iranians accused in the investigation of the attack of the jewish community center in one thousand nine hundred and ninety four
less than forty eight hours after nisman's body was found the court that had received the criminal complaint published the entire document on the internet
traffic was so heavy that the website hosting the document crashed for a while
the two hundred and eighty nine page report makes its case based on tapped telephone conversations between representatives of argentina and iran and concludes that the south american nation agreed to stop pursuing the named iranian suspects in the bombing in exchange for an oil for grain and meat deal with iran
a little background
in two thousand and seven argentina requested the arrest of several iranians in connection with the one thousand nine hundred and ninety four bombing including former defense minister ahmad vahidi
interpol approved so called red notices for these suspects alerting countries around the world of buenos aires desire to have them arrested
according to nisman's report representatives on fernandez's behalf held both secret and public meetings where it was agreed that the trade deal could be reached if the red notices were withdrawn
it was a geopolitical move to <unk> argentina's economic position at the cost of forgoing justice in the bombing of the argentine israelite mutual association building according to nisman
intercepted phone calls between representatives of both countries show that there was a conspiracy to create a new hypothesis for the bombing and to redirect the investigation based on fake evidence that would remove the spotlight from the iranians nisman's report states
the public face of this plan was an agreement reached between both countries in two thousand and thirteen to jointly investigate the bombing by creating a <unk> truth commission nisman wrote
the plan never took off however because of an unexpected roadblock according to nisman's report
interpol refused to withdraw the red notices against the iranians
without that iran moved the deal to the back <unk> nisman wrote
the release of nisman's report was not a bombshell
its contents were widely reported but fernandez's government and its supporters outright rejected the allegations
fernandez focused her attack on nisman's sources including two <unk> that the prosecutor identified as working for the country's intelligence services
these alleged spies ramon <unk> hector <unk> and hector <unk> never worked for argentine intelligence fernandez said
everything nisman argues is false fernandez says the spies were spies argentina didn't ask interpol to withdraw the red notices trade between argentina and iran has actually decreased and so on
we think all the allegations are <unk> foreign minister hector timerman told cnn on thursday
fernandez's government has done more than any previous administration to get to the bottom of the bombing timerman said
i am jewish he said
and to think that a person of my religion the jewish religion can make a deal not to prosecute the death of eighty five people most of them jewish in argentina
i have to tell you it's not easy to live with
the argentine government was not involved in nisman's death in any way he said
nobody i mean wanted more for mr. nisman to live and to answer questions than the president of argentina and myself timerman said
if the accusations and counter accusations laid out by all sides aren't confusing enough additional theories continue to arise
in a news conference argentina's chief of the cabinet ministers <unk> fernandez offered new questions
nisman was on vacation in europe with his teenage daughter when he suddenly cut short his trip and returned to argentina according to the cabinet chief
things just get stranger he said asking who called him back in a hurry
why did he return
why did he leave his daughter there alone at an international airport
the cabinet chief said
it was previously reported in the local media that nisman told a reporter at least twice that this investigation might cost him his life
he also allegedly got the handgun from a friend because he feared for his security according to reports
the cabinet chief proposed another wrinkle
the closer we read the more we are convinced that nisman didn't even write that complaint
what is the reason behind filing this
what is the objective
this is what we must find out
the whole story is a tangled web that is hard to describe but reflects an observation argentine <unk> jorge luis <unk> once made
reality is not always probable or likely
the incident showed that smugglers aren't just going underground anymore using tunnels beneath the u.s. mexico border to transport drugs and migrants
now the smugglers are trying to do business using unmanned aerial vehicles
u.s. authorities acknowledge a new smuggling strategy may be emerging on the border
to date u.s. customs and border protection has not intercepted any drones smuggling narcotics across the borders into the united states said alberto <unk> <unk> border patrol agent in san diego
in collaboration with our federal state local and international law enforcement partners <unk> remains vigilant against emerging trends and ever changing tactics employed by <unk> criminal organizations behind illegal attempts to smuggle narcotics into the u.s
the drone was loaded with more than six pounds of the synthetic drug crystal meth <unk> police said
the drone crashed tuesday night in a supermarket parking lot in <unk>
apparently the smugglers became too <unk> mexican authorities said
the silver and black six <unk> spreading wings s nine hundred model was not able to withstand the weight of the load police said
in san diego the street value at last account for a six pound load would be about forty eight thousand dollar dea special agent matt <unk> said
once you get it across the border that <unk> like gold
this wasn't the first time a drone was used in a smuggling attempt from mexico according to drug war analysts u.s. officials and local mexican police
but the incident amplified concerns about border security and officers safety
i would hate to <unk> six pounds of meth <unk> said
that's like saying six pounds of heroin isn't bad
but i think the big thing to look at is the fact that the cartels or drug traffickers from mexico are using drones in their playbook
my greater fear being an agent is what a drone means to officer safety
that to me personally being a tactical officer that's my concern he said
drones are emerging as the latest technological gadget used by cartels and smugglers in trying to <unk> border authorities
the crashed drone was a prototype that used a global positioning system or gps to send it to a particular destination <unk> police said on the department's facebook page
the cartels have been using drones for surveillance
transporting drugs is a bit more complicated said sylvia <unk> a leading drug war analyst
this is further evidence that the cartels have unlimited funds and creativity
as to why smugglers would attempt to transfer what in the grand scheme is not that much both <unk> and <unk> were in agreement
my guess
it might be a personal load <unk> said
when you look at cartels their goal is to flood the u.s. with as much drugs as they possibly can <unk> said
it also could have been a test run for something bigger
wow
sunday evening it's nine thirty p.m. and i am beat
might fall asleep
guess i will find out how the patriots did in the afc playoff tomorrow
i arrived here in liberia friday evening january sixteen after a twenty six hour trip with my seven pieces of luggage filled mostly with donated drugs and supplies for elwa hospital the ministry sim runs just outside monrovia
i've spent some time catching up with our sim liberia country director will who just got back here from the uk about five days ago and dr. john my colleague who has been anchoring the hospital medical staff throughout the ebola crisis
because i wasn't due to report for work until monday we decided to clean the apartment where i had stayed in august as it had been <unk> since i left
dr. john and i suited up in gloves and gowns this afternoon to clean out the apartment <unk> items that were valuable <unk> of the rest washing the dishes in bleach and soap and <unk> all the surfaces with bleach
after a few more days of airing out it will be ready to use
it took over four hours in ninety degree heat
we were <unk> with sweat no wonder i am exhausted
later when i tested my camera to see if it still worked after sitting in the humid salty air for four months i looked at the pictures i had taken back in august
the final picture was one taken after i developed a fever
it was of a lovely pineapple upside down cake baked by a good friend from church who didn't even realize i was sick
her son had brought it to me after sunday worship service and i told him he had to just leave it on the step
returning to the apartment and seeing the picture of the cake brought me right back to my last weekend there
it <unk> my recollection of my feelings waiting <unk> to see if my fever would break praying <unk> and <unk> and focusing my thoughts on god's love and care for me whatever was to come
seeing all my friends and colleagues both missionaries and liberians has been great
it does feel like something is missing from our reunion since we are not hugging or shaking hands in liberia at this time
but still there have been wonderful smiles as people recognize me and express their thanks to god that my life was spared
liberians really know how to smile
most people are visibly relieved by the improvement in conditions
the number of cases of ebola has come down markedly the elwa two unit associated with our hospital is now empty
there are still scattered cases in isolated pockets around the city and in the rural areas in western liberia
people seem optimistic but still very vigilant
they remember that there was a significant drop in cases back in may early in the epidemic which turned out to be just a <unk> followed by a huge second wave
it also sounds like more people are getting themselves to a treatment unit on time for care so the survival rate is higher than it was at first
a dear friend told me the sad story of her neighbor who died of ebola in november
he was in denial the entire time and would not admit that his symptoms might be due to ebola
he died and unfortunately eight others in his family also got sick and died
many are recognizing this pattern
those who are quicker to suspect ebola and get tested do much better themselves and help protect their family and community
on the other hand those who remain in denial end up harming the ones they love
on the whole liberia has come to grips with the reality of ebola and i feel proud of their resilience and determination to beat this virus with god's help
it has become a cultural symbol of a deeply divided nation
along its winding path and elsewhere polish photojournalist <unk> mielnikiewicz met people whose lives have been profoundly changed since fighting erupted last year between ukrainian government forces and pro russia rebels
despite a shaky ceasefire which was reached last september sporadic fighting continues
i'm trying to show the amazing unbroken spirit of people which are united and determined to fight for what they believe mielnikiewicz told cnn on the phone this week
her camera captured fascinating people linked to the conflict
a masked fighter brandishing a piece of wood shaped like a rifle children wearing paramilitary uniforms standing at attention a young couple dramatically embracing in the midst of an intense protest
mielnikiewicz also photographed landscapes reflecting the mood of the region
a cable car suspended over the mighty <unk> giant concrete wave <unk> blocking a road and a protest billboard depicting russian president vladimir putin wearing a hitler style <unk>
the <unk> basically slices ukraine into two parts east and west as it flows roughly north to south connecting the capital kiev to the black sea
the farther east of the river you go residents tend to lean toward pro russia rebels
the farther west of the river people are more likely to support the government
i'm trying to keep a wider perspective mielnikiewicz said mindful that although the fighting has been limited to relatively small regions it has very much affected people nationwide
before the ceasefire an august report from the united nations said at least two thousand two hundred and twenty people had been killed since mid april two thousand and fourteen
at least five thousand nine hundred and fifty six had been wounded the report said not including the two hundred and ninety eight victims of malaysian airlines flight seventeen which was shot down over the region in july
russia annexed ukraine's semi autonomous region of crimea in march supported by <unk> ethnic russian majority
putin said russia was protecting crimea
but international opponents called it a land grab and slapped russia with economic sanctions
photographing people in war torn countries wasn't what mielnikiewicz had in mind when she first envisioned her career
she said she started as a very socially engaged person in general who aspired to become a painter
in a sense photography can combine those two things she said
you can be a socially engaged artist being a photographer
what interests me in photography is it can be a tool to be able to talk to people to discover their stories to tell their stories
she trained to become a film critic she said
but eventually mielnikiewicz knew she wanted to watch dramatic events unfold in real life instead of on the silver screen
her ukraine photos won mielnikiewicz a grant from the u.s. based aftermath project which encourages photographers to tell stories about the aftermath of conflict
she hopes she'll be able to return to ukraine this year to reunite with the people she met and see how their lives have changed
the ceasefire mielnikiewicz said doesn't seem to be working well
and the fighting
it doesn't look like there's an end to it
nonetheless she said she's discovered firsthand something that <unk> seem to share
the strength of ukraine is really amazing the determination she said
not just talking about the war i think they're a very strong people
the asteroid is called two thousand and four bl eighty six
it'll come about seven hundred and forty five thousand miles from earth or about three times as far away as the moon at eleven nineteen a.m
et according to nasa
you're wondering doesn't this happen all the time
yes and no
there are lots of asteroids that pose a threat to earth about five hundred and fifty as of january twenty two
none are predicted to hit anytime soon
but asteroid two thousand and four bl eighty six is big about a third of a mile in size
it will be the closest known asteroid this large to pass near earth until two thousand and twenty seven that's when an asteroid called one thousand nine hundred and ninety nine an ten flies by us
while it poses no threat to earth for the foreseeable future it's a relatively close approach by a relatively large asteroid so it provides us a unique opportunity to observe and learn more don yeomans the recently retired manager of nasa's near earth object program office at the jet propulsion laboratory in pasadena california said in a nasa press release
this asteroid is also interesting because you might be able to see it with strong binoculars or backyard telescopes
that's a rare opportunity for most of us
i may grab my favorite binoculars and give it a shot myself said yeomans
asteroids are something special
not only did asteroids provide earth with the building blocks of life and much of its water but in the future they will become valuable resources for mineral <unk> and other vital natural resources
they will also become the fueling stops for humanity as we continue to explore our solar system
there is something about asteroids that makes me want to look up
nasa scientists will snap radar generated images using the deep space network antenna at <unk> california and the <unk> observatory in puerto rico
yeomans retired january nine after sixteen years of tracking asteroids
paul chodas has been designated as the new manager
we should be getting some great radar images of this asteroid chodas told cnn
radar would be the key to study the asteroid's surface give an idea of its shape whether it has rocks and that kind of stuff on it
it'll be really exciting
if you don't have binoculars or a scope you can watch from the comfort of your computer on the virtual telescope project two point zero
the asteroid was discovered on january thirty two thousand and four by a telescope of the lincoln near earth asteroid research survey in white sands new mexico
want to know more about asteroids

firstly i think i must want for the record to refer to the events that have taken place in the last three weeks
and i just wish to reiterate and to reaffirm the statements which have already been made on my behalf by buckingham palace he said thursday at the world economic forum
earlier this month buckingham palace issued a statement which said it is emphatically denied that the duke of york andrew had any form of sexual contact or relationship with the woman
any claim to the contrary is false and without foundation
andrew is a son of queen elizabeth ii and a brother of prince charles the next in line for the british throne
the prince is accused of having sex with the woman when she was seventeen details of which are is a sworn affidavit in florida court dated january nineteen
the woman said that she and the prince had sex three times including one orgy
the court documents showed that her lawyers had sent a letter to buckingham palace asking to interview the prince under oath
in her sworn affidavit the woman described buckingham <unk> denial that sexual contact ever took place between the pair as false and hurtful to me
the woman identified by buckingham palace as virginia roberts first named the prince in a civil motion filed december thirty in the u.s. district court in southern florida in which she claims she was forced to have sex with several men
she is referred to as jane doe no
three in the legal filings
in the letter the woman's lawyers sent to buckingham palace attorneys paul <unk> and bradley edwards asked to interview prince andrew under oath regarding interactions that you had with jane doe no
three beginning in approximately early two thousand and one
jane doe no
three was then seventeen years old
the letter includes a picture of the woman and andrew which was taken around that time they say
the lawyers also want to discuss subsequent interactions with their client in new york city later that year the letter says
the interview could be conducted at a time and place of your choosing and with your cooperation i believe the interview could be completed in two hours or less it says
new court <unk> involving the relationship between jane doe no
three and the prince are being prepared the letter adds but their filing will be delayed if andrew <unk> the interview request by january nineteen
the attorney for her legal team confirmed to cnn that buckingham palace had refused to accept the letter to prince andrew and that it was returned to them
buckingham palace didn't respond thursday when asked by cnn about the letter
but the woman's allegations have previously been firmly rejected by buckingham palace
it is emphatically denied that the duke of york had any form of sexual contact or relationship with virginia roberts
any claim to the contrary is false and without foundation the palace said early this month
prince andrew is named in the court filing in florida as one of a number of prominent people who allegedly had sexual contact with teenage girls through self made billionaire jeffrey epstein who pleaded guilty some years ago in florida to a state charge of prostitution solicitation
cnn was unable to reach martin weinberg epstein's attorney on thursday
in her first sworn statement to the court jane doe no
three gave more details of the alleged encounters
epstein made me have sex with prince andrew several times she said according to the court document
i had sex with him three times including one orgy
i knew he was a member of the british royal family but i just called him andy
one day when she was in london she said epstein told her she would be meeting a major prince
she continued
epstein told me to exceed everything i had been taught
he emphasized that whatever prince andrew wanted i was to make sure he got
when the prince arrived she was introduced she said and we kissed formally cheek to cheek
the group went for dinner and to a nightclub where she was served alcohol before returning to the <unk>
the picture referred to in the letter of the prince with roberts was taken there she said
after the pair were left alone she said we went to the bathroom and bedroom which were just steps away from where the picture was taken
we engaged in sexual activities there
afterwards andy left quickly with his security
she said she had reported back to epstein on the encounter next day telling him it went great
i told epstein about andy's sexual interests in feet
epstein thought it was very funny
epstein appeared to be collecting private information about andy she added
roberts also gave details of two more alleged occasions when the pair had sex
one was in epstein's new york mansion in spring two thousand and one she said when she was seventeen
the third and last occasion was at an orgy involving nine girls on epstein's private island in the u.s. virgin islands her statement said
i was around eighteen at the time
epstein andy approximately eight other young girls and i had sex together
the other girls who appeared to be under eighteen were european looking and sounding and didn't really speak english she said
she said she felt disgusted after the orgy
roberts rejected the <unk> denial of the allegations and said she hoped andrew would agree to be interviewed under oath
i did have sexual contact with him as i have described here under oath she said
given what he knows and has seen i was hoping that he would simply voluntarily tell the truth about everything
roberts and another woman are seeking to join two other women who are arguing in federal court for the u.s. government to <unk> its case involving epstein
the investment banker agreed to a state plea deal in two thousand and seven and began serving an eighteen month sentence in two thousand and eight according to court documents
he pleaded guilty to solicitation of prostitution and procurement of a minor for prostitution

a sixteen year old norwegian soccer sensation martin odegaard is set for <unk> after being <unk> by spanish giants real madrid
much is expected of odegaard with pretty much every european elite football club rumored to have expressed an interest in securing his signature
but will <unk> tale have a happy ending
spanish giants real madrid are hoping so after <unk> in for the kill
it's an honor and a dream come true odegaard told the real website as he was unveiled by the spanish club alongside one of the real greats <unk> <unk> who labeled the norwegian as an extraordinary talent
the reason i chose real madrid is because this team has the best conditions both in sporting terms to develop as a player and off the field to develop as a person added odegaard
while his <unk> age means he will initially enter real madrid's b team <unk> by french great <unk> <unk> it might not be too long before he's <unk> the crowd at the spanish club's <unk> stadium
<unk> success in norway has <unk> quickly with the <unk> nation gripped by his meteoric rise
norway is hit by a serious serious odegaard fever norwegian news agency's <unk> <unk> told cnn
i would say that in general for the moment it is a kind of pride that little norway and little <unk> has produced a football talent like this
the fresh faced forward who has spent his entire career to date with <unk> debuted for norway last year becoming the youngest player to appear in a european championship qualifier aged just fifteen years and three hundred days old
my goal is to become the best player possible said odegaard
it isn't important if i play in the first or second team
it's a major advantage having a second team of a really high level and with a coach who was one of the best players in the world and it was also important in my decision added the norwegian teenager referring to <unk>
only time will tell and odegaard has a lot of it on his side
the number of fighters killed has not been publicly discussed before but was disclosed by the u.s. ambassador to iraq stuart jones who told al <unk> television earlier in the day that an estimated six thousand fighters have been killed
jones said the military effort was having a devastating impact on isis
the estimate was calculated by u.s. central command and finds isis fighters have been killed in iraq and syria by coalition airstrikes according to a u.s. military official
centcom has kept a running estimate of fighters killed but has not made it public
u.s. intelligence estimates that isis has a total force of somewhere between nine thousand to eighteen thousand fighters
however it is also believed the group can draw on thousands of other fighters whose loyalty shifts and could muster a force upwards of thirty one thousand total
defense secretary chuck hagel would not confirm the six thousand deaths estimate instead saying thousands have been killed
on whether the body count is a sign of progress hagel said it's a measure but i don't think it's the measure
i was in a war where we did body counts and we lost that one hagel said referring to his service in vietnam
until now the pentagon has stayed away discussing the matter other than to estimate that thousands of fighters may have been killed
speaking to reporters thursday rear admiral john kirby was adamant that the us is not keeping a body count and said it would be wrong to state that there is such a count
he called it a tally and said the notion of a body count suggests vietnam war era statistics
in that war the pentagon offered body counts as a measure of its success against the <unk> <unk>
kirby said the tally was not aimed at showing any metric of success against isis
all of this comes after iraq has criticized the u.s. for not doing enough to help their fight against isis
the u.s. has long said airstrikes are aimed at degrading isis as a threat but would not by themselves get rid of the organization
secretary of state kerry speaking to reporters in london echoed the u.s. ambassador in saying the strikes have halted isis momentum and reclaimed more than seven hundred square kilometers from isis in iraq
in iraq airstrikes around mosul have been stepped up significantly in support of peshmerga fighters on the advance in the region
the effort now is to cut a key isis supply line into mosul a us military official said
the official stressed the us can not confirm the exact number but has based its calculation based on pilot reports and other intelligence gathered about a target before and after a strike
the safety of the civilian crew members and the environment are our top priorities
so we're taking this situation very seriously and will continue to investigate the situation until it's resolved said cmdr

the ship is stable right now marks said
any water found in the ship is just from the normal tide going in and out
<unk> were at the location assessing the best way to free the vessel in conjunction with the japanese
the u.s. navy is working closely with japanese authorities to assess the situation and determine the best course of action to <unk> the vessel the navy said
no leaks from the hull have been found and no damage to the surrounding area has been reported
the ship carries one hundred and thirty one crew members thirty eight civilians and sixty seven army and twenty six marine corps personnel the navy said

but on wednesday officials told cnn that federal investigators didn't find enough evidence and that justice department prosecutors won't recommend civil rights charges against wilson
attorney general eric holder who has the final say in the matter has said he will announce his decision before he leaves office which is expected to be by the spring
the news that emerged wednesday is likely to upset those who saw the federal investigation as a way to pursue justice for brown and his family
i think you have a lot of people who will be disappointed if this does turn out to be the case said antonio french a st. louis city <unk> who lives near ferguson
the community and the family wanted a day in court an opportunity to see all the evidence laid out cross examined
and it looks like that's not going to happen
some legal experts however said the prosecutors decision wasn't surprising in light of the laws involved
but this doesn't mean that all legal avenues are closed off for the brown family
first let's explore why analysts aren't surprised by the news
these cases are very hard to bring said cnn senior legal analyst jeffrey toobin
if someone is not prosecuted on state charges the odds that they will be prosecuted on federal charges are substantially lower toobin told cnn's anderson cooper
holder had already acknowledged at the situation in november saying that federal civil rights law imposes a high legal bar in these types of cases
but he also may have raised some people hopes according to <unk> martin an attorney
holder traveled to ferguson he talked to that community and he talked about how aggressive the department of justice was going to be in its own independent investigation martin told cnn
the brown family doesn't appear to have been holding out much hope from the federal investigation
family attorney benjamin crump had expressed pessimism in november about the probable outcome
that is a very high standard and it's not very likely crump said
the family understands if there is no indictment it is likely the killer of their child won't be held accountable and that's heartbreaking to them
martin said the federal hate crimes statute wasn't designed for cases like this one
i think there's a lot of confusion about the federal hate crimes statute and how it should be used she told cnn
the key factor in the investigation was likely to be whether wilson exhibited racial hostility toobin said in august
the most important thing would be did he say anything that indicates racial hostility either before or after or during
toobin said
wilson is white and brown was african american
but race didn't have to be a factor in the shooting for investigators to allege there was a federal civil rights violation said cnn legal analyst danny <unk>
federal statute says it's a crime for government officials to willfully deprive a person of a right or privilege protected by the constitution
federal prosecutors could have argued that brown's right to life was violated <unk> a criminal defense attorney said
but it's a tough case to make
they have to show that the officer intended to deprive somebody of that constitutional right he said
they would have to show intent to <unk> is not a particularly easy showing to make
so what avenues are still open for the brown family
legal experts still expect brown's family to file a civil lawsuit against wilson and the ferguson police department
crump said in november that the family is considering the option of civil <unk> to obtain some sense of justice
the family could file a <unk> death lawsuit against wilson and the ferguson police department cnn legal analyst paul <unk> said at the time
he said brown's family could file a lawsuit under section one thousand nine hundred and eighty three of title forty two of the u.s. code a federal statute that permits damages against state officials for violations of legal or constitutional rights
another cnn legal analyst mark <unk> noted in november that law enforcement officers are afforded certain legal protections
wilson's attorney neil <unk> told cnn that he was expecting a civil suit from brown's family
but he said he thought they would have a difficult case to make
even though it's a different standard in a civil case you still have elements you have to prove and they're going to flow very closely to what you have to prove in a criminal case <unk> said
if you don't have enough for a grand jury even to issue an indictment it's going to pretty hard i think in a civil suit he said
the justice department is also carrying out a civil rights investigation into the ferguson police department's overall track record with minorities
that inquiry is examining accusations that the police department as a whole practiced racial profiling and heavy handed tactics
but that type of investigation typically looks at possible reforms for a law enforcement agency rather than punishing past alleged misconduct analysts say
people consistently expressed concerns stemming from specific alleged incidents from general policing practices and from the lack of diversity on the ferguson police force
these anecdotal accounts underscore the history of mistrust of law enforcement in ferguson that has received a good deal of attention holder said in september
our investigation will assess the police department's use of force including deadly force
it will analyze stops searches and arrests
and it will examine the treatment of individuals detained at ferguson's city jail holder said
wilson resigned from his position as a ferguson police officer in november
the fbi joined local officials in interviewing more than two hundred people and looked at much the same evidence as a st. louis county grand jury that decided in november not to indict wilson who is white on any charges in brown's death
that federal law enforcement agency has now completed its investigation into the august shooting and sent its findings to the justice department a law enforcement official and a separate u.s. official said wednesday
based on that probe justice department prosecutors won't recommend civil rights charges against wilson because there is not sufficient evidence to support them a u.s. official told cnn
the new york times first reported the development wednesday
the justice department report has not been completed and attorney general eric holder ultimately will make the final decision whether to press federal civil rights charges against wilson
still it wouldn't be a surprise if holder doesn't call for charges
while he's been outspoken on ferguson met with brown's family and said he understood african americans mistrust for police after the incident the attorney general acknowledged in november that federal civil rights law imposes a high legal bar in these types of cases
the shooting of the eighteen year old brown stirred months of emotionally charged widespread and at times violent demonstrations in ferguson a few miles northwest of st. louis
hands up don't shoot became a mantra for protesters nationwide decrying what they called undue unfair police violence against african americans <unk> even after grand jury testimony disputed whether brown ever actually raised his arms in surrender
those protests <unk> up in the days immediately after the shooting with anger growing due to what some saw as law <unk> heavy handed response
and they swelled again after the grand jury's decision this fall not to indict wilson on state charges
if holder decides based on prosecutors recommendation not to press federal civil rights charges against wilson that could <unk> things up yet again
antonio french a st. louis city <unk> who has been involved in the ferguson protests thinks some people will be disappointed at the least
the community and the family wanted a day in court an opportunity to see all the evidence laid out cross examined french said
and it looks like that's not going to happen
i hope we don't have any violence as a result of this
for now though brown's family is laying low
what are the brown family's options
benjamin crump a lawyer for the family has said he felt federal civil rights charges against wilson were not very likely given the very high standard that has to be met
cnn senior legal analyst jeffrey toobin has noted that authorities would need proof that wilson exhibited racial hostility presumably by what he said before during or after the shooting
the brown camp deferred comment on wednesday's news reports suggesting there would be no charges
the family of michael brown jr. will wait for official word from the justice department regarding whether or not any charges will be filed against the police officer who shot and killed him crump said in a written statement
the family won't address speculation from anonymous sources
even without charges this story isn't over
it's possible that brown's family will file a civil lawsuit against wilson who resigned in late november citing security concerns
and the u.s. justice department still has another open investigation this one looking at the ferguson police department as a whole
anecdotal accounts underscore the history of mistrust of law enforcement in ferguson that has received a good deal of attention holder said in september
our investigation will assess the police department's use of force including deadly force
it will analyze stops searches and arrests
and it will examine the treatment of individuals detained at ferguson's city jail
that investigation could lead to significant changes in ferguson much as similar federal probes have produced in new orleans los angeles pittsburgh cincinnati and elsewhere
but it wouldn't mean charges for wilson personally or that anyone would go on trial
it's also possible there could be legislation policy changes or personnel <unk> not forced by the federal government
in his state of the state speech on wednesday missouri gov
jay nixon said addressing the broader systemic issues raised by the unrest that followed the killing of brown would demand sustained effort
the legacy of ferguson will be determined by what we do next
to foster healing and hope
and the changes we make to strengthen all of our communities he said
at the least french said he expects more protests to keep up pressure on authorities
that's a good thing he said
but we want to keep them peaceful nonviolent because violence makes the situation worse
it divides the community in a time we need to come together and make everyone feel like they can get equal protection
ultimately he said some of the protesters goals can be achieved outside the courts
the next steps i think are legislative change french said trying to make sure that in cases like this we get a special prosecutor by law and to create a new level of civilian oversight over police departments
i didn't alter the ball in any way brady said at a press conference
i have no knowledge of wrongdoing
i have no explanation belichick said of the controversy dubbed deflategate
the nfl is investigating why game balls the patriots provided for sunday's afc championship game were underinflated
espn citing nfl sources familiar with the probe reported that eleven of twelve game balls that the patriots used on offense were found to be underinflated by about two pounds per square inch each
a ball with lower inflation is said by some to be easier to grip and may give the <unk> a competitive advantage
what the heck is deflategate anyway
brady said he picked the footballs he wanted to use five hours before the game feeling the <unk> and the leather but not paying attention to the inflation level
the nfl <unk> balls should be twelve point five thirteen point five psi
it's not like i squeeze the football he said
i grip the football
brady said he didn't touch the balls again until the game began
the referees inspect footballs about two hours before kickoff and deliver them to ball attendants who take them to the sidelines according to nfl rules
the patriots opponent the indianapolis colts provided their own footballs
brady also said he couldn't tell any difference between the balls in the first and second <unk>
radio station <unk> in boston reported that the underinflated balls were discovered in the first half and replaced with properly inflated balls in the second half when the patriots expanded their lead over the indianapolis colts
the final score was forty five seven
ball inflation may not be a problem at the february one super bowl game between the patriots and the seattle seahawks
michael <unk> the nfl's vice president of football communications said chicago bears equipment manager tony <unk> will oversee the game balls
dressed casually in a sweater and a wool hat brady seemed <unk> by the controversy at times during the thirty minute press conference
brady thirty seven is the handsome face of the patriots one of the united states most successful sports franchises
the team has won three super bowls all with belichick and brady and won its division the afc east twelve times in fourteen years
his stardom reaches far beyond football fans since he's married to model <unk> <unk> and has worked as a model himself
his net worth is one hundred and twenty million dollar according to <unk> dot com
though brady himself has a clean image suspicions of the patriots remain because of a two thousand and seven cheating incident called <unk> in which the team stole defensive signals from the new york jets
belichick was fined five hundred thousand dollar and the nfl took away a first round draft pick
some people are suspicious of brady
speaking thursday morning on cnn affiliate <unk> sports radio former dallas cowboys quarterback <unk> <unk> said its obvious tom brady had something to do with this
for the balls to have been deflated that doesn't happen until the quarterback wants that to happen i can assure you of that
hall of fame coach john madden told the sports <unk> he believed belichick was clueless about the ball pressure but i can see and you hate to make examples of what you can see because that sounds like you are accusing someone but i can see that being between the quarterback and the equipment guy
though the nfl announced its investigation on monday brady said nobody from the league has questioned him
brady said he didn't know anything about deflategate until a monday interview with <unk> in which he said the idea of <unk> with footballs is ridiculous
on thursday he said i was surprised as anybody when i heard monday morning what was happening
when a reporter directly asked brady whether he was a <unk> the quarterback replied
i don't believe so
i've always played within the rules
he added that he doesn't have all the answers but doesn't know of anybody in the patriots organization who might have done something wrong with the ball
i don't know what happened over the course of the process with the footballs
i was preparing for my own job doing what i needed to do he said
earlier on thursday belichick said he was shocked to hear allegations that his team's footballs were underinflated
he said that he's learned more about the football inflation process in three days than he has known or talked about in his forty years in the league
in my entire coaching career i have never talked to any player staff member about football air pressure the patriots coach said at a press conference
that is not a subject that i have ever brought up
to me the footballs are approved by the league
<unk> and we play with what's out there
belichick one of the most successful head coaches in nfl history with three super bowl rings and two hundred and eleven regular season wins insisted he had no explanation for how the footballs his team used sunday might have gotten deflated
but in the future belichick said new england's game balls will be inflated at high enough levels so closer to thirteen point five psi than twelve point five psi when they may naturally drop to below acceptable levels to account for any possible change during the game
his comments come days after indianapolis reporter bob kravitz broke the news after sunday's game that the nfl was looking into whether the patriots used underinflated footballs during the afc championship contest
the <unk> came to light on the field after indianapolis colts linebacker <unk> jackson intercepted a pass thrown by brady
for all the talk by unnamed sources the nfl's official statement on the controversy is <unk>
we are continuing our review and will provide information as soon as possible
deflategate is not the nfl's only scandal this year
the league established a six game unpaid ban for personnel who violate the league's policy on domestic violence after several players were arrested
at issue is an allegation of an inappropriate relationship a u.s. military official told cnn
capt
john r. <unk> has been temporarily reassigned to a post in <unk> florida the navy said in a statement released wednesday
the navy did not say why <unk> further details due to an ongoing <unk> investigation
but a u.s. military official said that in the course of investigating the death of a civilian the navy received information alleging that <unk> was engaged in an inappropriate relationship with the <unk> wife
according to the miami herald christopher <unk> was found dead in the waters off guantanamo bay on january eleven
he had been a worker at the base <unk>
having an affair violates military law the uniform code of military justice and could in itself constitute grounds for <unk> reassignment
there are initial indications that <unk> death was a suicide but no cause of death has yet been determined according to one official with knowledge of the situation
defense secretary chuck hagel was asked about the story by reporters at the pentagon on thursday
he confirmed that <unk> was no longer in command but had no further comment
well the base commander has been relieved said hagel
it is now in the <unk> of appropriate authorities
so i won't have anything to say specifically about that which would be inappropriate
but the commander has been relieved and that is right
the naval commander at guantanamo bay does not oversee the detention facility that president barack obama has vowed to close
<unk> has been in charge since june two thousand and twelve
the decision to relieve him of his duties was made by rear adm. mary m. jackson commander of navy region southeast the military said in a statement
in the post titled to the youth in europe and north america ayatollah ali khamenei calls on young people to seek out their own understanding of islam and he <unk> the media's portrayal of muslims following the massacre of sixteen people at the french satirical magazine and at a kosher supermarket in paris this month
the recent events in france and similar ones in some other western countries have convinced me to directly talk to you about them khamenei's letter reads
i am addressing you the youth not because i overlook your parents rather it is because the future of your nations and countries will be in your hands

the paris attacks which have provoked a wave of anti islam protests in the west were retribution for charlie hebdo's lampooning of islam over the years
the magazine's first issue after the attack which features a caricature of the prophet mohammed on its cover has sparked demonstrations across the muslim world
but the leader of iran where chants of death to america have been a familiar refrain at friday prayers and parliamentary sessions since the islamic <unk> founding in one thousand nine hundred and seventy nine strikes a more conciliatory tone in his message to young people in the west
i don't insist that you accept my reading or any other reading of islam his letter reads
what i want to say is
don't allow this dynamic and effective reality in today's world to be introduced to you through <unk> and <unk>
don't allow them to <unk> introduce their own recruited terrorists as representatives of islam
khamenei also <unk> on western history explaining that the united states and europe have a long tradition of <unk> people of color and non christians
he describes his admiration for <unk> western historians who are in his words deeply ashamed of the <unk> wrought in the name of religion between the catholics and <unk> or in the name of nationality and ethnicity during the first and second world wars
khamenei calls on readers to ignore media <unk> of islam
receive knowledge of islam from its primary and original sources
gain information about islam through the <unk> and the life of its great prophet he writes
why does the power structure in the world want islamic thought to be marginalized and remain latent
khamenei asks readers to ask themselves then
i would like you not to allow the derogatory and offensive image buildings to create an emotional gulf between you and the reality
the supreme leader finishes with a hopeful message that future generations would write the history of this current interaction between islam and the west with a clearer conscience and lesser resentment
khamenei's letter comes at a time of thawing relations between iran and the u.s. as the two longtime adversaries try to hammer out a deal on the future of iran's nuclear program
barack obama even sent a letter to khamenei in october pointing out that they share a common enemy in isis the sunni islamist terror group that has seized huge chunks of syria and iraq
but diplomatic progress has not stopped the ayatollah from <unk> the west on social media in recent months
he called the u.s. the enemy on twitter two weeks ago in a tweet about nuclear talks and in august he blasted the treatment of african americans in a tweet about the protests after the police killing of an unarmed black teen in ferguson missouri
and in november khamenei tweeted a nine point explanation of why israel should be <unk> a comment that infuriated israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu who urged western powers to pull out of nuclear negotiations with iran

surrounded by stunning coral reefs mauritius spans less than eight hundred square miles and is home to over one point three million people mainly an <unk> and religiously diverse mix of people of indian african french and chinese heritage
the country dotted with green sugar cane fields sparkling <unk> and jagged volcanic mountains is well known for its perfect palm <unk> beaches and <unk> blue seas attracting nearly a million tourists annually
despite the global slowdown in recent years the <unk> economy has consistently achieved annual growth rates of more than three percents with <unk> showing a rise to three point five percents in two thousand and fourteen and four point one percents in two thousand and fifteen
the country enjoys the best business environment in africa according to the world bank which ranks it first in the continent for ease of doing business

in fact sugarcane is the country's major export crop in two thousand and thirteen mauritius produced an estimated four hundred and seven thousand tonnes
yet despite sugar being a major export for decades mauritius has managed to successfully <unk> its economy mainly by investing in the manufacturing sector
initially the focus was placed on the production of <unk> and clothing but lately the country has begun setting its sights on exporting jewelry and watch components
jewelry watch and diamond production currently make up ten percents of the <unk> foreign exports adding more than one hundred and fifty million dollar to the country's gdp
overall the manufacturing sector expanded by three point zero percents in two thousand and thirteen up from two point two percents the year before

books with titles like the wisdom of failure top <unk> lists and there is even a popular annual conference <unk> that gathers people together to study past fails
but in spite of all the noise about how it's ok <unk> productive to fail it can still be a painful and challenging experience
so what is the best way to bounce back
imf chief christine lagarde in recent interview with cnn gave a robust suggestion
oh get over it

in fact many women at the top of their fields say that setbacks can be a great source of strength
cnn's leading women team were curious to find out how other women recover when things don't go their way so we asked members of the linkedin connect
professional women's network powered by <unk> for their thoughts
below is their collected <unk> and wisdom on the matter
learning was a huge theme with many variations on the idea that a failure can be a great teacher
<unk> <unk> writes that when things go wrong she tries to look for the lesson so that she doesn't make the same mistake again
she doesn't want history repeating itself
<unk> <unk> a business communications expert leadership adviser and author cautions that failure is only a good teacher if you choose to be a good student
your failures reveal more than your successes but only if you face them with the desire to better understand yourself she adds
<unk> bacon a freelance artist and art <unk> writes that sometimes the fear of failure can cause you to do just that
i failed at my first attempt at self employment because i was afraid of risk
bacon has learned from the experience and wrote that now she takes part in the things that mean the most to her and which might lead in the most interesting directions

her advice is to be resilient make good decisions and never give up

she listed the lessons she had learned including one that she says she is still learning
forgive yourself
the mistakes are in the past
the money is gone
use your precious energy to rebuild not tear down she adds
marilyn foreman a business coach says that she tends to beat herself up about her failures
but <unk> remember that the only place we learned to link failure with our own sense of value was in school when we were measured <unk> and judged on whether we did something right or not
she finds comfort in the fact that there is no link between our value and whether we make a mistake or not
because if you approach it with the right attitude failing could be the best thing that ever happened to you
what you think of as a failure one year may well be responsible for a series of actions afterward that leads to an enormous win later writes barbara berger a creative director
nothing is static
as long as you keep moving and remain motivated there will always be a light at the end of a sometimes very long tunnel she adds
i have definitely found that adversity is one of the most significant growth and development opportunities assuming the individual takes time to reflect on what was learned
as hard as it is to through these difficult times <unk> and committing to moving forward will make you stronger and is a common characteristic of high potential leaders she writes
doctor patricia <unk> mcguire says
i have now lived long enough to realize that failure is just part of the <unk> in fact of the process of success
that the experience of failure is simply to know what will not work what should not work or what could not have worked at the time
she sums it up as

successful methods such as chemotherapy work by killing the cancer cells but they also destroy healthy tissue
health practitioners have been searching for a magic bullet that goes straight to the source of the cancer and everything from monoclonal antibodies which carry cancer drugs direct to cancer cells to straight surgery to cut out tumors have been used with varying degrees of success
in belgium engineer and nuclear physicist yves jongen is pioneering a new therapy that targets cancers with proton radiation
a therapy that offers precision and minimal side effects
i started to designing equipment proton therapy of cancer that was a radically new idea jongen told cnn
encased in a two <unk> thick concrete bunker that serves as a radiation shield one of jongen's cyclotron machines produces proton beams to treat cancer patients
in this space we accelerate the protons and we give them a higher and higher velocity until they reach two thirds of the speed of light that's two hundred thousand km per second and this acceleration takes place in the shape of a spiral he said
that's needed if you want to be able to penetrate one foot into the body of a patient
once the proton beam has been generated it's <unk> into a treatment room where patients receive a powerful dose of targeted radiation that kills only those cancerous cells
it does a lot less collateral damage to the patient jongen said
that's the great thing about proton therapy
while proton therapy is a giant step forward it's not yet the magic bullet that clinicians are looking for
so far it is not effective against all types of cancer
there are a number of cancers which are not localized he said
if you look at leukemia which is cancer of the blood cells there is nowhere to shoot it's all through the body
the other drawback is that the cyclotron is not cheap
each system and the bunker needed to house it doesn't leave much change from one hundred and twenty five million dollar
currently there are just forty three operational particle therapy facilities worldwide with a total of one hundred and twenty one treatment rooms
as the fame of the process has started to spread some people have been taking desperate measures to get treatment
one british couple last year even sparked an international manhunt after they removed their son from hospital without doctors permission to get to a proton center in prague in the czech republic
proton treatment is limited on britain's national health service
just one center in the north of the country offers proton therapy for certain types of eye tumors
other centers however are currently in development
while the proton therapy market is expected to more than double by two thousand and eighteen with an estimated three hundred proton therapy rooms jongen's brussels based company <unk> is working on a smaller and cheaper model they hope will make proton therapy more accessible
it would be much less expensive making it more possible for a hospital to afford it a smaller system can already treat a relatively large number of patients per year
at the moment fewer than one percents of cancer patients are treated with proton therapy but jongen is hopeful that smaller and cheaper machines will be the game changer
i have a number of letters from parents of young kids saying if it had not been for this treatment we would have lost our kid he said
that's something i really cherish
when i feel a bit depressed for whatever reason i go back to those letters and they are very exciting

the <unk> of yemeni president abdu rabu mansour hadi and other officials are the latest fallout from the houthis move in recent days to gain power in the capital which included kidnapping hadi's chief of staff on saturday and taking over the presidential palace on tuesday
the chaos in yemen is cause for concern far beyond the country's borders
for the united states and its allies yemen's government has been a key ally in the fight against al qaeda in the arabian peninsula the yemen based group linked to attacks such as the recent slaughter at french magazine charlie hebdo
the united states responded by reducing embassy personnel in the capital because of security concerns a senior state department official said thursday night
while the embassy remains open and is continuing to operate we may continue to re align resources based on the situation on the ground the official said
the cabinet and prime minister khaled bahah resigned before hadi did on thursday night with bahah telling hadi in a letter that they essentially wanted to wash their hands of destructive political chaos an apparent reference to the deal that was to give houthis more power
we resigned so that we are not made party to what is going on and what will happen bahah wrote in the letter which yemeni information minister nadia sakkaf posted on twitter
hadi's resignation came soon afterward
it wasn't immediately clear who would succeed hadi
the houthis latest push to power picked up steam on saturday
the houthi rebels shiite muslims who have long felt marginalized in the majority sunni country kidnapped presidential chief of staff ahmed bin mubarak in the capital sanaa on saturday
the rebels then took over the presidential palace tuesday prompting talk of a coup
the tentative deal reached wednesday called for bin mubarak's release as well as measures to give the houthis more political power according to a yemeni official with access to a draft text of the agreement
but by thursday before the top officials quit sakkaf questioned whether the rebels would live up to their side of the pact
ahmed mubarak is still houthis hostage despite deal
they got what they want why should they fulfill their promise
she said on twitter
she added i have been following up the promises to release dr. ahmed bin mubarak since the beginning
conclusion
buying time
mistrust was <unk> the implementation of the peace deal both sides said thursday
one yemeni presidential adviser told cnn the government was waiting for the houthis to release bin mubarak but acknowledged that the rebels have withdrawn some forces
ahmed al <unk> a houthi official said they were unsure of how serious hadi was about the deal and that they were keeping twenty percents of their militia numbers in the presidential palace and other key buildings as a guarantee
questions about who was in charge over the past few days have sparked concerns that a power vacuum could help terrorist groups get a stronger foothold
besides the charlie hebdo attack aqap also tried to blow up a plane landing in detroit in two thousand and nine
isis is also recruiting in yemen to expand its ranks
under the peace deal the houthi rebels agreed to withdraw their militias from key government institutions if officials take a significant step
rewriting parts of the country's constitution according to the yemeni official
under its terms the government would accept changes in the draft of the new constitution that would grant the houthis more political power
word of the deal still leaves many questions unanswered
what could the reshaped constitution look like
how much power will the rebels get
u.s. officials said they're unclear about the intentions of the houthis
do they want to run the government
or be a powerful opposition
there are currently no talks with the houthis but there are discussions about whether to talk to them according to u.s. officials
multiple policy options are being considered the officials said though there is no consensus yet about how to proceed
several of the constitutional changes sought by the houthis would emphasize the characteristics of yemen as a federal state and push for more inclusion of diverse groups
seven things to know about yemen
the houthis call for marginalized political groups to have the right to partnerships in state institutions and fair representation according to the text of the tentative agreement
in return for these government concessions the rebels basically agree to withdraw their fighters from the capital where they control or blockade several government installations
the presidential palace the presidential residence the prime minister's residence and a military installation where missiles are housed
a houthi official said the rebels would abide by the deal if the president follows a timeline specified in the negotiations for the political process
this isn't the first time the rebels and the government have hammered out an agreement
houthis swept into the capital last year sparking battles that left more than three hundred people dead in a month
in september they signed a ceasefire deal with the government and houthis have since installed themselves in key positions in the government and financial institutions
as violence flares seven things to know about yemen
chairi a twenty seven year old belgian comedian who performs with a humorous <unk> group that calls itself the muslim <unk> was speaking several days after a deadly gun battle erupted last week between suspected jihadists and police in the eastern belgian town of verviers
news of the suspected belgian terror cell immediately sent ripples of fear through this small european country's muslim community
i was freaking out
really scared said chairi who fears young belgian born muslims could become victims of a backlash after the raid
my mom said no one can go out tonight because of what happened said <unk> <unk>
the nineteen year old waitress said her frightened mother made her skip work the night of the anti terror raid
both chairi and <unk> were speaking in the lounge of a muslim youth center espace <unk>
espace <unk> opened little more than a year ago with the goal of promoting a peaceful and productive blend of european and islamic values
but the center's director said the recent reports of a suspected homegrown belgian terror cell emerging so soon after french jihadis massacred cartoonists in the paris office of the satirical magazine charlie hebdo had threatened this vision of moderation and integration
we condemn what's happened
this is not our vision our understanding of our religion said director <unk> el hajjaji
in french <unk> english he explained how belgium's muslim community was finding itself increasingly trapped between two ideological extremes
we face islamist radicalization
but we also face the increase of islamophobia in belgium el hajjaji said
we know that <unk> islamophobia discrimination help this radicalization of young muslim people here in belgium
the january fifteen raid in verviers resulted in the shooting deaths of two belgian citizens
police said they were found in possession of assault rifles handguns explosives and police uniforms
the suspects have been accused of being part of a plot to target belgian police inspired by the ultra violent ideology of isis
the gun battle triggered an international manhunt
since january fifteen belgian authorities have arrested and charged at least seven belgians with participation in a terrorist organization
the federal prosecutor's office announced three of the suspects were intercepted at the airport in brussels while trying to fly to greece with plans to then travel on to syria
a senior belgian counter terrorist official tells cnn the suspected leader of the verviers cell is a young belgian of moroccan descent named abdelhamid abaaoud
abaaoud who is still at large appeared in an isis propaganda video laughing and joking to the camera while driving a pick up truck that was dragging at least half a dozen corpses through a field
he also brought his teenage brother to syria who has since appeared in photos posing alongside isis fighters
he is not the only molenbeek native to embrace the isis jihad
there are several people who left here to fight in syria
and some who came back
that's the danger said molenbeek mayor <unk> <unk>
she spoke to cnn in the <unk> central square which is ringed with <unk> <unk> shops and grocery stores advertising their goods in french and arabic
a <unk> procession of residents many of them women wearing islamic headscarves <unk>
in the side streets one could over hear conversations in french arabic and turkish
molenbeek has a large predominantly muslim population of first second and third generation immigrants from north africa
the mayor said the neighborhood also suffered from soaring youth unemployment estimated at more than forty percents
as part of their effort to stop the suspected isis linked cell in verviers belgian police have carried out multiple raids in molenbeek over the course of the last week
the defense attorney for a molenbeek native arrested by police last week said his client was innocent of terrorism charges
didier de quevy argued that his client an unemployed former twenty five year old security guard named marouane el bali did not fit the terrorist profile because he had no previous criminal record
he lives in molenbeek which is one of the neighborhoods most <unk> by terrorism and thus it's a miracle not to have problems with the authorities when you live there de quevy said
while unemployment is rampant online propaganda for isis bloody interpretation of jihad is often only a button click away
chairi the comedian who also hosts a radio show that touches upon belgian muslim affairs <unk> that his radicalized peers don't learn their islam in mosques or in institutions
they learn it on the internet
he recalled meeting a young muslim convert
just a few months after embracing islam in belgium chairi said he read in a newspaper that the young man was killed fighting on the <unk> of syria
it goes so fast
even the religious leaders they don't understand it chairi said
people radicalize themselves said el hajjaji director of point espace
el hajjaji says he has taken to social media to denounce online propaganda urging volunteers to join isis
but he <unk> the jihadi message can be tempting to vulnerable youths
the speech to get you to go to syria is very simple
you have your enemy you want to have the power to build your future and you don't need to find a solution to the complexity of your life that we have here in belgium el hajjaji said
it is this toxic mix of unemployment <unk> and the <unk> call of jihad that have helped make brussels the capital of europe a recruiting ground for terrorism
in two thousand and ten <unk> fonseka was sentenced by a military court to thirty months in jail and denied his political rights for irregular <unk> during his time in charge of the army
a previous court martial had stripped him of his title of general and deprived him of his pension for <unk> in politics
fonseka who led government forces to a decisive victory over <unk> tiger rebels in two thousand and nine following a bloody civil war had fallen out of favor with previous president <unk> <unk> and his powerful brother defense secretary <unk> <unk>
that split came after fonseka unsuccessfully challenged <unk> in early two thousand and ten presidential elections
he was eventually pardoned by president <unk> and freed in two thousand and twelve but he remained <unk>
fonseka returned to the public eye in the past few months campaigning for <unk> <unk> who swept to the presidency earlier this month
<unk> has pledged to <unk> the country's most prominent military figure
a statement on the presidential <unk> official website read
former army commander <unk> fonseka has been fully pardoned by president <unk> <unk>
the former army general who led the decisive war against the <unk> to end the terrorism in sri lanka was stripped off of his ranks and rights by the previous government
fonseka has been acquitted of all charges filed against him under the previous government and has been granted complete amnesty by president <unk> <unk>
president <unk> pardoned the former general by the powers vested in him under article thirty four of the constitution
accordingly <unk> rank will be restored and will be entitled to all military and social privileges without any legal barrier
he will be awarded back his medals and honors
this week's two hundred million dollar demand in return for the lives of two japanese citizens perhaps represents a change of tactics from isis the group that now rules over large parts of syria and iraq as they realize that with the notable exceptions of the u.s. and the uk the willingness of western nations to resist making some form of payment in the face of youtube videos of their citizens begging for their lives is weak
is an unwavering resistance towards ransom payments a constructive position to take
is offering no hope of some form of negotiated settlement in the best interest of a nation's citizens
or would it in fact make more sense to take a flexible approach that operates on a case by case basis engages in negotiation and considers all possible options including ransom
the arguments against payment are well rehearsed and oft repeated by those that attempt to hold the international line
since nine eleven the attempt to <unk> terrorist organizations of financing has been a cornerstone of the global effort to counter these groups
payment of ransoms to terrorist organizations for the safe return of citizens is thus entirely contrary to the blizzard of national and international laws and norms that have emerged
at a two thousand and thirteen summit in northern ireland world leaders noted that the international community has made significant progress in combating the flow of funds to terrorist organizations but also drew attention to the substantial financial benefit being earned through ransom payments and the incentive this provided for further kidnappings
following the g eight summit and notwithstanding the fact that in two thousand and nine the u.n. reminded member states of their obligation to prevent the payment of ransoms to terrorists under security council resolution one thousand nine hundred and four the security council passed a further resolution in january two thousand and fourteen calling upon member states to prevent terrorists from benefiting directly or indirectly from ransom payments
without doubt paying ransoms encourages more kidnappings it is a self <unk> self reinforcing cycle
the u.s. administration argues that hostage takers looking for ransoms distinguish between those governments that pay ransoms and those that do not
and make a point of not taking hostages from those countries that refuse to make concessions
be that as it may the murder in two thousand and nine of british citizen edwin <unk> by al qaeda in the islamic maghreb whilst his fellow swiss and german captives were freed following the reported payment of a substantial ransom shows that refusing to pay is risky
furthermore the procession of gruesome beheadings visited on american and british hostages by isis in two thousand and fourteen suggests that in the knowledge that the u.s. and uk will not pay ransoms captured citizens from these two countries are far more likely to be murdered in the pursuit of propaganda
while paying ransoms increases the risk of further kidnappings it also clearly increases the likelihood of a safe and successful outcome
offering to consider ransom demands introduces a critical <unk> for success namely a willingness to negotiate
the secretive world of kidnap for ransom insurance provides a source of <unk> insight
this industry <unk> following the kidnap ransom and death of the twenty month old baby son of u.s. <unk> charles <unk>
at the heart of the growth and success of this niche industry is its ability to respond to and engage with kidnappers normally via <unk>
success is judged not only by the safe return of a captured individual but also by the ability to negotiate a price that is far removed from the opening ask
knowing that ransom payments to designated terrorist groups are illegal <unk> specialists will quickly pass insured situations involving terrorist groups to government authorities and the outcomes are rarely as favorable as those that can be achieved via expert negotiation
periodically the facts presented to policymakers change and policymakers must adapt
such a moment for adaptation has arrived
kidnap for ransom is an increasingly widely used tool by terrorist groups
nasser al wuhayshi leader of yemen based al qaeda in the arabian peninsula which is estimated to have earned twenty million dollar from ransom between two thousand and eleven and two thousand and thirteen asserts that kidnapping hostages is an easy spoil and a profitable trade and a precious treasure
in several recorded messages al qaeda leader <unk> al zawahiri has called for supporters worldwide to kidnap westerners
stomach churning as it may be to finance designated terrorists in recent months citizens of france germany denmark and italy have returned safely home
citizens of the uk and the u.s. have not
the point blank refusal to pay ransoms is wrong headed
a more nuanced approach that leaves all options including payment open for negotiation is much more likely to result in success
they call themselves the eyes and ears of <unk> a reference to the mountains from which they fled
young mainly in their twenty s sometimes younger these student refugees share a similar narrative
their villages tucked away in the remote regions of south <unk> in the sudan became uninhabitable
they were <unk> down on with rockets
they could no longer grow food keep cattle go to school
they joined fifteen thousand other refugees in <unk> <unk> camp in south sudan
now they want their stories to be heard
they are citizen journalists in the making
last november <unk> <unk> a communication officer for the united nations high commissioner for refugees and a self described repository of stories launched an initiative that trained twenty one students from the community in digital storytelling through smartphones
i travel around and meet these amazing refugees who have been through some of the most horrifying situations and my responsibility is to help them get their story out to amplify their voice she says
but as <unk> we forget that these are their stories to tell
at first she recalls the students didn't know how to turn the phones on
growing up in the west we take for granted our visual literacy
we're literally bombarded with images from the moment we wake up to the moment we go to sleep
these students don't come from that culture so even with issues like framing and point of view we were really starting from scratch she recalls
by the end of the course <unk> says they knew how to use the phones better than i did
the phones have since gone to the local school which has adopted a kind of lending library for other students who want to learn <unk> skills and sign the equipment out
the students paired the photos they took with a narrative
some opted for straight quotes from their subjects a la humans of new york

it's a rare frilled shark that has been caught by a fisherman in australia where no one remembers ever seeing one caught before
with a mouth packed full of needle like teeth and a body like an <unk> the six foot long frilled shark is sometimes described as a fish fossil that dates back eighty million years
david guillot says that it's like nothing he or his fellow fisherman have ever seen in the deep waters in australia's southwest
it was really prehistoric looking <unk> really guillot said
he caught the fish while <unk> for fish at one thousand one hundred meters a week ago and thought he might have discovered some new type of shark
i've been fishing thirty years and never saw anything like it
so i brought it in he said by phone from his boat thursday
honestly we thought we had caught a brand new species maybe discovered something wild
the shark is known to live at extreme depths in both the atlantic and pacific oceans but is very <unk> caught because its habitat is mostly off limits to fishing said simon <unk> of australia's south east <unk> fishing industry association
guillot said that the frilled shark was still alive when he got it to the surface
but it did not live after being pulled up from the frigid depths
so he offered it to a local museum

williams faced <unk> <unk> whose slide in the tennis world the previous two years could largely be attributed to injury and illness
the <unk> <unk> is a former world no
two and took on williams on a much <unk> stage the wimbledon final in two thousand and ten
<unk> was still a heavy underdog thursday and playing without pressure built up three set points on the williams serve at five three in the first set
trouble for the world no
one
but just as maria sharapova and rafael nadal stepped up when their backs were against the wall wednesday so did williams
she erased all three of the set points to hold
it was the start of a ten game run that propelled the eighteen time grand slam winner to a seven five six zero win on the first day of <unk> conditions temperatures reached almost thirty six degrees celsius in melbourne at the year's opening major
things really clicked williams told reporters
i had no other option but for things to click
i just had to start playing better
williams dropped just eight points in the second set an ominous sign for her third round foe <unk> <unk>
williams older sister venus also progressed to the third round by crushing fellow american lauren davis six two six three
serena said she continues to draw inspiration from venus who was diagnosed with the autoimmune disease <unk> syndrome in two thousand and eleven
she's like yeah if i win it'll be great
if not i'm not going to worry about it serena said
i think that's a great attitude because it takes a lot of pressure off of you
she's done so much in her career
she doesn't have to win another match
the same thing for me
as long as we can kind of look at it that way then we both will do really well
another <unk> second round clash saw two time australian open champion victoria azarenka <unk> with u.s. open finalist caroline wozniacki

last year's wimbledon champion petra kvitova beat germany's <unk> <unk> six two six four
kvitova is one of the contenders at melbourne park this year having <unk> in sydney last week
the two thousand and thirteen australian open finalist <unk> <unk> is flying under the radar thus far which she probably doesn't mind
and after getting past the tricky kirsten <unk> in the first round <unk> crushed unpredictable bulgarian <unk> <unk> six two six zero
sharapova saved match points in defeating qualifier alexandra panova but it's an uncommon feat
saving match points two matches in a row is almost unheard yet veteran <unk> lopez has done it
the spaniard <unk> off three match points against american denis <unk> prior to saving one more thursday in the third set versus frenchman adrian <unk>
lopez the twelve th seed eventually advanced when <unk> retired with heat exhaustion while leading six four six four six seven zero four
i feel very lucky lopez told the australian <unk> website
i think those two matches i won i shouldn't won at least not the one today
i was very lucky
there was no such drama for top seed novak djokovic
djokovic needed less than an hour and a half to see off young russian <unk> <unk> who upset grand slam finalist david ferrer at wimbledon last year six zero six one six four but defending champion stan wawrinka had to work somewhat harder against romanian qualifier <unk> <unk>
wawrinka <unk> seven six seven six six three
despite the loss <unk> can take heart from the fact he hit the fastest serve of the tournament at two hundred and forty two kilometers per hour
in a week filled with mostly positive results for the australians favorite <unk> hewitt in his record nineteen th straight tournament appearance blew a two set lead to fellow thirty three year old benjamin becker of germany
becker previously zero six in fifth sets came through two six one six six three six four six two
u.s. open finalist kei nishikori admitted to feeling slightly dizzy due to the conditions but still eliminated another big server ivan <unk> of croatia
<unk> failed to serve out the fourth set and nishikori ran out a four six seven five six two seven six winner
hot out there said nishikori
a lot of sun
it wasn't easy
especially third and fourth set i was a little bit dizzy and tired
but you know it's going to be like this in australia so i think i was ready for it
hopefully i won't play this condition again
for nishikori the weather forecast looks promising
the forecast high for the next two days is twenty seven degrees celsius prior to the highs falling to the low twenty s
that teenager called kim disappeared in a southern turkish border city earlier this month leading authorities to suspect that he may have slipped away to syria to join isis
while police have not concluded that he joined the terror group authorities found he had a keen interest in the islamic militants
using a twitter profile picture of an isis flag he frequently tweeted i want join and asked to meet brothers
he followed pro isis accounts and often retweeted the group's propaganda
on his social media posts he claimed he was from chechnya and lamented that male are being <unk> against
i hate feminist he said according to a post on his twitter account on october five
so i like the isis
he retweeted arabic posts and tweeted in english but never in korean
his last tweet was sent on october ten which was the same month he began asking his mother if he could go to turkey according to seoul metro police agency
kim's mother told police that she had not been aware of his interest in isis
cnn was unable to reach kim's parents
south korea may not be a probable place for aspiring isis members with less than zero point three percents of the population identifying as muslim
but isis has expanded its reach globally
the islamic militant group has attracted disaffected youth from around the world including the united states france europe and australia
there have also been reports about recruits joining isis from asia triggering concerns in the region
why is isis so successful at luring westerners
earlier last year there was a report of a chinese fighter caught in iraq in september
it's unclear how many chinese nationals may be fighting with isis but one former chinese special envoy to the middle east said there could be about one hundred
it remains unclear if some of them are <unk> a muslim minority group in xinjiang
approximately three hundred and fifty southeast asians were estimated to be in iraq and syria said a singapore official during a security council meeting in november
currently two japanese hostages are held by isis with a demand for two hundred million dollar ransom
no word from isis on hostages

<unk> <unk> a religious scholar and adjunct senior fellow at the council on foreign relations described a profile of young people who seek to join isis as feeling <unk> or marginalized
they feel somewhat they're having a crisis of identity
the assumption is that the religiously <unk> are the ones joining isis but that's not proven out by the data we have so far
kim began <unk> with an individual whom he met on twitter over an encrypted messaging service police said
on january eight he arrived in turkey with a korean guardian
two days later he disappeared from a hotel in <unk> a city near the syrian border
his guardian reported him missing to the south korean embassy in turkey on january twelve
the dead were mainly killed by arson attacks on buses and cars police said
the two most recent victims who died of their injuries in hospital thursday were victims of bomb blasts
the opposition bangladesh nationalist party along with nineteen allied parties called for general strikes and a nationwide blockade on road rail and river transport on january five the first anniversary of disputed elections
the bnp and its allies <unk> those elections with bnp leader and former prime minister <unk> zia arguing they would have been rigged by the government and refusing to participate unless they were conducted under a neutral caretaker administration
her arch rival prime minister sheikh hasina of the <unk> league refused to concede to the demands and <unk> to victory
more than half of the <unk> three hundred seats went <unk>
voting was conducted under neutral caretaker governments in bangladesh from one thousand nine hundred and ninety one until two thousand and ten when the system was scrapped by the governing <unk> league
communications minister <unk> <unk> said wednesday that at least seven drivers and their assistants on public transport were among those killed in the renewed violence which has seen two hundred buses torched in recent weeks
the government has also blocked <unk> whatsapp and other messaging apps which it says are being used to coordinate the protests

bnp secretary general <unk> <unk> islam <unk> is among those arrested
the bnp claims the true number under arrest is higher
the government is offering a reward of one hundred thousand <unk> for information leading to the arrest of any of those behind the attacks <unk> said
bangladesh politics has been dominated by zia and hasina for decades with both enjoying multiple stints in power
hasina the daughter of <unk> first president sheikh <unk> rahman was first elected prime minister in one thousand nine hundred and ninety six while zia widow of assassinated president <unk> rahman first became pm in one thousand nine hundred and ninety one
hasina has blamed zia for the violence and accused the opposition of trying to foment chaos while zia has denied her party is responsible saying the violence is the work of the government
both zia and hasina have frequently called for mass protests while in opposition
both their parties had planned rallies on the january five anniversary of the two thousand and fourteen election
after police banned the rallies the opposition proceeded
zia was confined to her office by police at the beginning of the protests which the government said was for her own security
she has since been released
the fatalities are among at least ten civilians killed total in addition to twenty injured in the shelling of four city districts in the past twenty four hours the donetsk city council said on its website
ukraine's state run ukrinform news citing the donetsk government reported eight dead and seven hospitalized in the bus stop attack alone
donetsk has been a stronghold for separatists who have been battling government forces for control of the donetsk and luhansk regions since the spring
as of now the situation remains difficult the city council said
and as has been the case with many incidents in the conflict there was no universally accepted explanation of what happened or who was responsible
russia's foreign ministry demanded an investigation and criticized ukraine for its shelling of ukrainian cities like donetsk which are controlled or at least full of pro russian separatists
yet ukraine's defense ministry blamed the rebels for the attack saying it was launched from areas they control
the organization for security and cooperation in europe which has a monitoring mission in ukraine is among those trying to get to the bottom of it all
its deputy chief monitor alexander hug told reporters that an <unk> patrol saw seven bodies near a vehicle that had been hit
and it's not the only instance of violence in the area
terrorists using multiple launch missile systems precisely destroy houses in the donetsk region cities of debaltseve and <unk> ukrinform reported citing donetsk regional police chief vyacheslav abroskin
rebels captured sixteen wounded ukrainian soldiers after fighting at <unk> airport kiev's military said according to ukrinform
negotiations are underway to secure their release
and the osce in an update posted wednesday cited numerous instances of shelling in recent days with two hospitals in separatist held territory among the buildings affected
as u.s. gen. philip <unk> nato's supreme allied commander europe pointed out thursday
violence has intensified and changed character in ukraine
as has been true so often in recent months the violence is happening around the same time as negotiations aimed at stopping it
the latest talks happened wednesday in berlin and included the foreign ministers of ukraine and russia as well as germany and france
their official aim was to resolve the crisis by hammering out how to implement a peace deal that was agreed upon last year
after wednesday's talks the four foreign ministers condemned the continuing violence and called for the peace deal that was reached in minsk belarus last september to be respected
fighting in the donetsk and luhansk regions has severely escalated causing the loss of many human lives including civilians
this must stop immediately and the regime of quiet must be restored the ministers said
they said tangible progress must be made on full implementation of the minsk pact ahead of a planned peace summit
the attack on the donetsk <unk> bus station obviously doesn't help the situation
russia's foreign ministry called it a a crime against humanity a great provocation aimed to undermine the efforts for the peaceful settlement of the crisis
the unrest began in late two thousand and thirteen leading up to <unk> ouster last february of pro moscow president viktor yanukovych
russia annexed the crimean peninsula a few weeks later with fighting breaking out in april in two ukrainian regions bordering russia donetsk and luhansk
separatist leaders there declared independence from ukraine and sided with russia
but how much was and is moscow involved in their campaign
it depends who you ask
officials in moscow have expressed sympathy for the separatists but denied any outright military support
however ukraine and its allies have accused russia of <unk> the rebellion by actively backing it
it is clear that russia has to stop supporting the separatists and respect international law said danish gen. <unk> <unk> chairman of the military committee for nato which doesn't include ukraine but is working to further its military to military cooperation with kiev
on wednesday ukrainian president petro poroshenko <unk> a claim that russia sent troops across the border to support the rebels
we have more than nine thousand russian troops who so called lost the way crossing our russian ukrainian border bring with them hundreds and hundreds of tanks armed personnel carriers and killing ukrainian civilians and attacking ukrainian troops poroshenko told cnn
russian foreign minister sergey lavrov speaking in moscow before the berlin talks responded to ukraine's assertion with a firm denial much like other denials made by russian officials in recent months over similar allegations of armed intervention
as to the flow of troops and <unk> this is not the first time we hear something like that he said
and each time i hear that i say if you're so confident about that please present us with facts but no one has been able to provide us with these facts
<unk> <unk> the leader of the far right anti muslim nine hundred and sixty nine movement made the remarks about <unk> lee the u.n.'s special <unk> on myanmar at a public rally on friday
don't assume you are a respectable person just because of your position he said in the speech footage of which was widely circulated on social media
to us you are just a <unk>
the comments drew a sharp response from the u.n. high commissioner for human rights <unk> <unk> al hussein who described wirathu's remarks as sexist insulting and utterly unacceptable
i call on religious and political leaders in myanmar to unequivocally condemn all forms of incitement to hatred including this abhorrent public personal attack he said in a statement released from geneva wednesday
it's <unk> for u.n. special <unk> to be treated in this way
lee was on a ten day visit reporting on the human rights situation in the predominantly buddhist southeast asian country which is emerging from a half century of military rule
she had spoken out about the crisis facing the country's one point three million strong rohingya muslim minority most of whom live under apartheid like conditions in <unk> state with limited access to adequate healthcare and education
since an outbreak of <unk> violence between <unk> and muslims in two thousand and twelve more than one hundred and thirty thousand live in <unk> displacement camps they are forbidden to leave
lee also criticized proposed law changes backed by the monks including a bill restricting <unk> marriage and religious <unk>
she made reference to wirathu's comments in a statement this week
during my visit i was personally subjected to the kind of sexist intimidation that female human rights defenders experience when advocating on controversial issues she said
<unk> was jailed in two thousand and three for <unk> anti muslim violence but released in an amnesty nine years later
<unk> minister of information and presidential spokesperson <unk> <unk> posted comments on his facebook page indicating he would ask the ministry of religious affairs to look into wirathu's speech

the last few weeks have seen <unk> of some european cities as <unk> full of muslims areas where a woman without a veil might feel too scared to explore areas that police largely avoid and where sharia law rules the day
this storyline has struck a nerve in place like the british city of birmingham and the <unk> neighborhood of paris coming on the heels of terror attacks in france that killed seventeen and stirred worries around europe
it's left some angry dismissive or <unk> unsure of what to make of it all
who are these people they ask making sweeping damning assessments of their <unk> from thousands of miles away
when i heard this frankly i choked on my <unk> and i thought it was april fools day british prime minister david cameron told network <unk> referring specifically to fox news commentator steve emerson's remarks
this guy is clearly a complete idiot
the central english city of birmingham has a long and proud history from stone age era <unk> to roman <unk> to medieval markets and more
today the city is home to more than one million people who partly due to its universities are younger than england's overall population with forty five point seven percents under age thirty
birmingham is also relatively diverse with about forty two percents of its citizens being not white and twenty two percents born outside the country
in terms of religion just over forty six percents of residents are christian just under twenty two percents are muslim and about nineteen percents have no religion
it is not as emerson described it earlier this month
there are actually cities like birmingham that are totally muslim where non muslims simply don't go in
this assertion is wrong as emerson and fox later admitted
but that doesn't mean it didn't sting
britain's press association talked to several people in birmingham some of whom called such claims ridiculous others who dismissed them as misconceptions and one called it simply ignorant
we are not in <unk> land <unk> mohammed <unk> co owner of the <unk> brothers market founded by pakistani immigrants told the guardian
there are lots of muslims here but this is a multicultural society and there are beautiful links between the different religions
how can they say this
birmingham is one of the stable communities
some poked fun at the remarks on twitter with one claiming the british army
sent snow to make birmingham white again and another showing a picture of a <unk> hall called mecca
joked one man
was a bit surprised that i had to convert to the muslim faith before they'd let me off the train at birmingham the other day
birmingham wasn't the only british city caught up in the controversy
so too was the capital london
emerson for one talked about no go zones around england
and during a speech in london jindal said that in the west non assimilationist muslims establish enclaves and carry out as much of sharia law as they can without regard for the laws of the democratic countries which provided them a new home
it is startling to think that any country would allow even <unk> for a so called no go zone he said
the idea that a free country would allow for specific areas of its country to operate in an autonomous way that is not free and is in direct opposition to its laws is hard to fathom
jindal later doubled down on the comments telling cnn's max foster that there are people here in london that will tell you there are neighborhoods where women don't feel safe
without veils and where police are less likely to go
a cnn crew went out to <unk> the london <unk> with the largest muslim population and found people who thought the republican governor's remarks were not based in reality
they said they felt safe and comfortable in a community that looked like many other parts of the city
this is not something we recognize at all marsh said
we don't have areas in london that are no go
we don't have areas in london that are sharia law only
and we police all areas of london
this debate unfolded hundreds of miles from the place that got the world talking about it in the first place
paris
that's where two islamist extremists stormed the offices of charlie hebdo magazine january seven leaving twelve dead
a policewoman in the paris suburb of montrouge was killed a day later
the next day the national nightmare <unk> in a pair of raids that killed three terrorists on top of the four civilians dead after a hostage siege at a kosher market in eastern paris
these events and their ties to an extreme twisted and violent form of islam made what's happening in france a talking point for commentators worldwide
some of that media buzz drew the ire of french nationals in particular fox news for emerson's comments and segments suggesting there are parts of paris and other european cities where islamic law is practiced and where police are fearful to work
paris mayor anne <unk> went so far as to lay out plans to sue fox news for having insulted her city
the image of paris has been prejudiced she told cnn's christiane amanpour
and the honor of paris has been prejudiced
not everyone in france is rallying around charlie hebdo especially after it published a cartoon depicting the prophet mohammed after the attacks
teacher eric <unk> told cnn that many of his muslim students felt the magazine's staff had some responsibility for what happened saying they continued doing what they were doing in full knowledge of the risks
yet even if the entire country isn't on the same page when it comes to the satirical magazine that doesn't mean some places are isolated at least when it comes to police patrolling the streets or whether anyone including women without veils feel welcome on them
cnn's laura <unk> grew up in the paris neighborhood of <unk> which has a large number of muslims and immigrants
she describes it as a lively place where rent is a little cheaper items at the market cost a little less and people feel welcome wherever they come from
people who are there now echo that view saying they feel safe comfortable and happy to live somewhere that people of all ethnicities and religions call home
it's no wonder then that some proud french nationals felt disgusted by the idea of outsiders casting <unk> on such neighborhoods as dangerous places
others fought back with humor as evidenced in a fake french news show le <unk> journal in which two men pretending to be fox news reporters are seen on the streets of paris
a graphic on the screen reads paris dangerous city
at one point one of the actors talks about getting in a taxi with a driver who had a muslim beard
oh my god he's a very dangerous islamist
he wants to kill us
a little later on one <unk> as his fellow correspondent goes in and out of a turkish restaurant
john it's too dangerous
come back come back
run away run away the actor screams in <unk> desperation

to all members of isis kenji goto is not the enemy of isis
please release him junko ishido goto's mother said in a statement thursday
there is so little time left before the deadline
isis has threatened in a video released tuesday to kill two japanese citizens goto and haruna yukawa if it doesn't receive two hundred million dollar in ransom from the japanese government
time is of the essence
the japanese government says it estimates isis ultimatum will expire at two fifty p.m. friday tokyo time
i sincerely apologize to the japanese government and all concerned foreign countries for all the trouble that my son has caused ishido said
i have been just crying for last three days filled with sadness
words fail to describe how i feel
kenji always has been a kind person ever since he was little
he was always saying i want to save the lives of children in war zones
japanese officials have said they are doing their best to communicate with isis but japanese chief cabinet secretary yoshihide suga said thursday that tokyo had so far heard nothing and doesn't know what situation the two hostages are in
in a thursday news conference japanese chief cabinet secretary yoshihide suga said japan wants to secure the hostages safe release but will not yield to the threat of the terrorists
he said japan was trying to reach the isis captors through third parties such as governments in the region or local tribal leaders but has not been able to determine whether goto and yukawa are safe
we are aiming to save them as soon as possible suga said thursday
the government of jordan has told japan it will do as much as possible to try to secure the release of goto and yukawa according to suga
jordan one of the arab nations taking part in the u.s. led bombing campaign against isis already has its own challenge to deal with
the militant group last month captured a jordanian pilot whose plane crashed in syria
japanese officials have repeatedly stressed that their military which is constitutionally forbidden from taking action other than for self defense isn't involved in the international airstrikes against isis positions in syria and iraq
the masked militant speaking in the isis video linked the group's ransom demand to japanese prime minister shinzo abe's recent pledge of two hundred million dollar in financial aid to countries affected by the militant group
suga reiterated thursday that the funds japan has offered are for humanitarian purposes like helping refugees not military purposes
leading japanese news organizations have reported citing unidentified government sources that goto's wife got an e mail in december from someone demanding eight million dollar to sixteen million dollar for her husband's return
the government is trying to confirm if that e mail came from isis the reports said
if so it could indicate the militant group is willing to accept a smaller ransom than the two hundred million dollar it had publicly demanded
but the question is what if anything is japan willing to give
isis has a ruthless track record
it has released videos touting the killing of five western hostages since august
abe has called isis ultimatum over the two japanese men's lives unacceptable and said the international community shouldn't give in to terrorists
but he and other government officials haven't explicitly ruled out paying a ransom
some details have emerged about what spurred the two japanese citizens to travel thousands of miles to the bloody syrian conflict
while they had different professions the two men knew and talked to each other said yukawa's friend nobuo kimoto
goto an experienced freelance journalist made a video in october near the turkish syrian border before he embarked on a perilous journey into isis controlled territory
it is my responsibility if something happens he explained
goto forty seven said he was determined to cover what was happening in the region
syrian people suffering three years and a half
it's enough he said
so i would like to get the story of what isis wants to do
alaaeddin al zaim who had worked with goto in syria previously says he warned him not to enter the isis stronghold of raqqa
i tell him it's not safe for you al zaim told cnn
but goto chose to go anyway saying i am not american i am not british
i'm japanese
i can go al zaim recalled
before he left goto gave al zaim a slip of paper with contact information for friends and his wife the mother of his young children
after hearing no word from goto for a week al zaim says called the wife
when i called her she's a very strong woman he said
the aims and activities in syria of yukawa a forty two year old unemployed widower are murkier
he originally headed to the war ravaged country early last year with the aim of gaining combat and survival experience to bolster his plans to set up a private security company said his friend kimoto
there yukawa met goto who gave him insights on how to survive there kimoto said
he also introduced him to rebel fighters who are distinct from isis even though both are fighting against syrian president bashar al assad's forces
some of the rebels talked about their need for ambulances to shuttle the wounded
that plea spurred yukawa to start raising money for this cause after returning to japan according to kimoto
i felt a chill when he said after returning home he felt in syria he was really living a life kimoto said
he seems to have felt satisfaction being there and living together with the locals
yukawa went back to syria in july a trip that kimoto said he didn't know about at the time
kimoto said he had advised his friend to focus on building up his private security company

that's according to a leading football simulator which is predicting that jose <unk> team will <unk> defending champions manchester city to the premier league title
football manager is a computer game which allows players to take control of their favorite team
using the game's <unk> database which contains data on nearly a quarter of a million players from around the world its makers have simulated the remaining matches of the two thousand and fourteen fifteen campaign
this included <unk> in the various injuries and <unk> <unk> teams have picked up since the game's initial release in november last year
and it's chelsea who emerged victorious finishing three points clear of defending champions city in second place
manchester united under the guidance of louis van <unk> came in third ahead of liverpool in fourth
this would spell disaster for arsenal who finished fifth in the fantasy table
if replicated in real life it would arsene <unk> team missing out on champions league football for the first time in eighteen years unless of course the london side win europe's premier competition

we're traveling from sanandaj the capital of iran's kurdistan province to marivan a small city just a few kilometers from the border with iraq
it's the final day of <unk> the iranian new year and my companions a doctor called ghaffar and a taxi driver named <unk> both from sanandaj are still on holiday
in a typical display of iranian hospitality they've offered to accompany me on the journey
to the left of the narrow road is a vertical sand colored mountain wall
to the right a fifty foot drop and a view across the spectacular <unk> valley a <unk> populated and beautiful part of the region
on the eastern edge of iran kurdistan province makes up part of a broader kurdish region which also spans adjacent sections of iraq syria and turkey
over the border in iraq the territory has been targeted by the islamic militant group known as isis but iranian kurdistan remains unaffected a peaceful world away from the violence
it also seems a world away from iran
although we're still within iran's borders the kurdistan region is quite different and more traditionally persian compared to the country's <unk>
culturally and <unk> the residents here have more in common with their fellow kurds across the border than with iranians from tehran <unk> or <unk>
dress is traditional
men sport <unk> <unk> trousers plain shirts and heavy felt <unk> while the women wear colorful dresses and headscarves rather than the black <unk> or hijab seen throughout much of the rest of iran
on the way we stop in a tiny village called <unk>
the mosque in the village is home to large handwritten quran said to be about one thousand three hundred years old
the <unk> facade carries an <unk> naming abu bakr the first caliph and according to sunni muslims the rightful successor of the prophet mohammed
although most iranians are shia muslims the kurds are predominantly sunni and this has often put them at odds with the iranian government
a few days earlier a kurdish man in sanandaj had told me that police had forcibly removed a satellite dish from his roof to prevent him receiving kurdish television channels
another had pointed at a photo of a shia cleric in my <unk> and shaken his head saying not good not good
after <unk> the road winds through snow capped mountains and then drops down into the village of <unk> at <unk>
here the houses are built into the steep hillside with the roof of one doubling as a <unk> area for the building behind it
large blue or green <unk> windows face out over the valley
children chase each other around the streets
wandering down the hillside we stop near a stream to drink tea bought from a small shop
as in other parts of iran people don't <unk> their tea directly preferring to place a sugar cube between their front teeth and then sucking the tea through the sugar
the <unk> owner asks me where i come from
russ stan french stan
he guesses
i tell him england stan and he smiles
welcome
as we drink the tea an elderly man walks to the edge of the stream removes his shoes and socks rolls up his trousers and wades out to a large flat rock in the stream
he <unk> his hands feet and head and then begins his afternoon prayers in turn standing kneeling and then pressing his forehead to the rock
once he's finished he carefully <unk> the way back and <unk> his feet with a cloth
as we continue the journey the doctor takes over the driving and progress is slower but the <unk> <unk> are no longer quite so terrifying
we arrive at marivan in the late afternoon
a large lake catches the afternoon sun and we stop at a restaurant at its edge
some friends of dr. ghaffar join us for a meal of <unk> fish rice and <unk> vegetables
we sit cross legged on the floor and drink more black tea
afterward music is played and people lock arms and dance in a line men at one end and women at another jumping in unison and kicking their feet in time to the music
one of the women's veils slips back off her hair but no one pays much attention
the dancing goes on until the sun sets over the lake
we leave marivan and head back toward sanandaj
the doctor's phone rings and he talks in rapid <unk> before suggesting we stop at a friend's house on the way
my friend is very wealthy he tells me and he can trace his family back one thousand three hundred years
we stop on the outskirts of sanandaj
the friend's house is certainly that of a rich man
<unk> gold picture frames <unk> black <unk> covered in intricate persian script <unk> woven carpets are laid out across the floor and a huge flat screen tv sits in the corner blaring out kurdish pop music
before stepping further inside i remind myself that it's not polite to shake hands with women in iran
as i'm mentally <unk> myself on my cultural sensitivity the sister of the owner of the house steps forward confidently shakes my hand and invites me to sit on the sofa
huge bowls of sweets and <unk> nuts are laid out
i sit next to the man's eldest daughter who takes out her iphone and shows me photos on her instagram feed
most of the images are of western fashion models
i ask her why and she says
model is the best job
she plans to go to university in tehran and wants to study german but her long term ambition is to leave iran and she has many questions about life in the west
it's late and after more dancing this time in the marble floored living room to the music coming from the tv it's time to go
<unk> drives back toward the center of sanandaj
he <unk> in kurdish again but this time there's a more melancholy tone to the song
how to get there
british canadian and u.s. citizens wishing to travel to iran must do so as part of an official tour due to restrictions on independent travel
most other foreign nationals need to obtain a visa before traveling and the application process can sometimes seem slightly opaque
it's worth checking the most up to date visa requirements ahead of traveling as these can change with little notice
a variety of airlines fly to iran with tehran's imam <unk> international airport the main international hub
once in iran getting around is made straightforward by the country's comfortable extensive and relatively cheap bus or train networks while for longer distances internal flights are an option
for shorter journeys and day trips taxis are relatively affordable due to low fuel costs
in tehran the metro is a good way to dodge the city's heavy traffic
that's all it took for the exchange to turn deadly
the police department in <unk> new jersey released video this week showing the death of <unk> reid thirty six who was shot on the night of december thirty
he was a passenger in a car that got pulled over for allegedly failing to stop at a stop sign
the <unk> video shows what happened next
officer <unk> days approaches the passenger side door
he asks how the two men inside the car are doing and identifies himself
the conversation is friendly
suddenly he steps back from the vehicle and pulls his weapon
days shouts over and over
show me your hands
don't you f move
he <unk> at his partner roger <unk>
get em out the car <unk>
we got a gun in this glove compartment
days reaches into the car and removes what appears to be a silver handgun
the shouting continues
i'll telling you i'm going to shoot you
you're going to be f dead
screams the officer
you reach for something you're going to be f dead
despite the officer's <unk> reid appears to push his way out of the passenger side door
he gets out of the car with his hands in front of him
both days and <unk> open fire
reid drops to the ground
the vehicle's other <unk> did not appear to be injured
he got out of the car lay on the ground and was handcuffed
a december statement from the local prosecutor's office did not identify the driver
it said a handgun was revealed and recovered during the stop
both officers have been placed on administrative leave and an investigation into the use of deadly force is ongoing the statement said
<unk> police capt
michael <unk> described days and <unk> as very good officers responsible for a lot of key arrests
another statement released this week said
the <unk> county prosecutor's office is committed to conducting a thorough fair and impartial investigation into the police involved shooting death of <unk> reid
requests for the release of additional information while the confidential investigation is ongoing stand in the way of completing a neutral objective and independent evaluation of the facts
this observation is not unique to this matter
<unk> said days was one of four officers who arrested reid last august on charges that included resisting arrest drug possession intent to distribute and failure to appear
the disposition of the case was not immediately known
in addition reid had been arrested six times by <unk> police since two thousand and nine on charges of making <unk> threats harassment <unk> obstruction marijuana possession and stalking according to police records
the disposition of each case is unknown
police and court records list reid's first name as jerome but the prosecutor's office listed it as <unk>
in new jersey some local leaders are demanding that the state take over the investigation
jerome put his hand ups said walter hudson chairman and founder of the national awareness alliance
you can see <unk> hands are clearly up
the police department reportedly released the video after a public records request was made by the south jersey times
does video of police tell the whole truth
the <unk> county sheriff's office ordered a new rug which turned up last week with a <unk>
the large green rug with the black and yellow <unk> county sheriff's office logo included the phrase in dog we trust within one of its <unk>
it was supposed to read in god we trust
the sheriff's office said rug manufacturer american floor mats would replace it
that could have been the end of the story except sheriff bob <unk> had an idea
he decided to auction off the unique item the <unk> rug as he called it and donate the proceeds to a local rescue
the <unk> county sheriff's office will not sweep anything under the rug the department said when it put up the item
jane <unk> is the founder of <unk> estates inc. she figured her shelter would net a few hundred bucks from the sale
i knew that the sheriff's office paid five hundred dollar for it she told cnn affiliate bay news nine
so i thought well that's great
we'll get five hundred dollar
but we had no idea it would escalate into what it has
eighty three bids later the rug was sold for a whopping nine thousand six hundred and fifty dollar
the money will go mainly toward vet bills <unk> said
last year the shelter adopted out one hundred and eighty six dogs
a lot of these dogs just come in in absolute terrible shape she told the affiliate
we started our foundation in two thousand with the idea that by backing innovative work in health and education we could help billions of people improve their lives
the progress we've seen so far is so exciting that we are doubling down on the bet we made fifteen years ago
here's our bet
the lives of people in poor countries will improve faster in the next fifteen years than at any other time in history
we're putting our credibility time and money behind this bet because we think there has never been a better time to accelerate progress and have a big impact around the world
here are four big breakthroughs we see coming by two thousand and thirty
first child deaths will go down by half
in one thousand nine hundred and ninety one in ten children in the world died before age five
today it's one in twenty
by two thousand and thirty it will be one in forty
almost all countries will include vaccines for diarrhea and pneumonia two of the biggest killers of children in their immunization programs
better sanitation will cut the spread of disease dramatically
and we're learning how to help more mothers adopt practices such as proper breastfeeding and skin to skin contact with their babies that prevent newborns from dying in the first month after they're born
second africa will be able to feed itself
today the continent has to rely on imports and food aid to feed its people even though seven out of ten people in sub saharan africa are farmers
part of the problem is that african farmers get just a fraction of the yields that american farmers get
in the next fifteen years however innovations in farming will erase these brutal <unk>
with better fertilizer and <unk> crops african farmers will be able to grow a greater variety of food and sell their <unk> to supplement their family's diet with vegetables eggs milk and meat
even as climate change makes farmers job more difficult we can get them enough innovation and information to increase productivity by fifty percents for the continent overall
countries like ghana are also building better roads and adopting policies that make it easier to move food to the places where it's most needed
in fifteen years africa will still import food when it makes sense to do so but it will also export much more eventually achieving a net positive trade balance
third mobile banking will help the poor radically transform their lives
today some two point five billion people don't have access to cheap and easy financial services a problem that makes it much more difficult to be poor
if your savings is in the form of jewelry or livestock for example you can't very well chip off tiny pieces to cover routine daily expenses
but in the next fifteen years digital banking will give the poor more control over their assets
the key will be mobile phones
already in developing countries with the right regulatory framework such as bangladesh people are using their phones to store money digitally and make purchases
by two thousand and thirty eight percents of the adults without bank accounts today will be doing the same
and by then mobile money providers will be offering the full range of financial services from interest bearing savings accounts to credit to insurance
fourth as high speed cell networks grow and smartphones become as cheap as today's voice only phones online education will flourish
before a child even starts primary school she will be able to use her mom's smartphone to learn her numbers and letters
software will be able to see when she's having trouble with the material and adjust for her pace
of course software will never replace teachers
but by allowing teachers to do things like upload videos of themselves and get feedback from their peers it can connect them in new ways
what will it take to make sure life really does improve faster for the poor
we need advances in technology and we need to deliver them to the people who need them most
we also need to close the gender gap
countries where girls don't go to school or women can't open a business will be left behind
another crucial factor will be people who care about helping those in the world's poorest places improve their lives
we're aiming to recruit millions of new advocates we're calling them global citizens to urge world leaders to be ambitious when they meet in september to adopt a new set of goals that will guide the world's efforts to tackle disease poverty and climate change for the next fifteen years
beyond two thousand and fifteen we hope these global citizens will hold governments and other decision makers accountable for meeting those goals
you can show your support by signing up at <unk> dot org where you can learn how to get engaged and connect with other organizations working to make two thousand and fifteen a historic year
we believe that informed passionate people can work together to make the world a more <unk> place
in fact we're betting on it

for the ten th year running european champion real madrid is the world's richest club in the annual football money league published by <unk> <unk> with a revenue of six hundred and thirty nine million dollar
money clearly talks in european football with the combined revenues of the top twenty clubs in the rich list rising by a staggering fourteen percents over the last year to seven billion dollar
all of the top five clubs for the two thousand and thirteen fourteen financial year saw their revenue surpass the five hundred million dollar mark for the first time on a list dominated by the english premier league home to five of this year's top ten and eight of the twenty strong list
as a result of the latest premier league broadcast rights deal all of its teams have made it into the world's top forty highest earning clubs
this year is the eighteen th running of <unk> money league which has been dominated by real for a decade although manchester united catapulted past both barcelona and bayern munich to move into second place with revenues of six hundred and two point three million dollar a hike in revenue of some one hundred and ten million dollar
united has been below par on the pitch in recent times under former manager david <unk> and his successor louis van <unk> but figures show an eighty three percents growth in commercial revenue over the last three years
that said united is expected to slide in next year's money league having missed out on champions league revenues in this current season
of the clubs on the list only <unk> noisy neighbors manchester city as alex ferguson once described them enjoyed a greater spike in year on year revenue with a one hundred and fourteen million dollar rise from two thousand and twelve thirteen to cement their place in sixth on the list
the growth experienced within the top twenty has been remarkable said dan jones partner in the sports business group at <unk>
commercial and broadcast revenues are now more important than ever to clubs to enable them to compete financially and put the best talent on the pitch
this has led to further dominance from the big five european leagues england germany spain italy and france this year with just turkey's <unk> making it in from outside of those countries

the club's continued success on the field is <unk> by its financial strength and their accomplishment emphasizes their position as the most successful european club side of all time
however their commercial <unk> is being challenged by manchester united among others

and the united states could be next warned jindal a republican who is considering a two thousand and sixteen presidential run
they may be second third fourth generation they don't consider themselves part of that country

jindal claims some european cities have no go zones
jindal <unk> up his controversial take on muslim immigration during an appearance wednesday on fox news the same network that originally reported the existence of no go zones in the u.k. and france before pulling its reporting and issuing four separate apologies on air
the network had originally reported that the british city of birmingham was a muslim only city and that neighborhoods in european cities like paris were no go zones controlled by radical islamists
fox news host neil <unk> told jindal we reported the same and we were wrong
we botched it and we apologized for it
but jindal stood by his comments <unk> claiming that fox only apologized for reporting that entire cities were no go zones
there are absolutely neighborhoods where the police are less likely to go in jindal said claiming that there are neighborhoods in the uk where muslim immigrants are imposing sharia law
asked whether he was still calling those areas no go zones jindal said you can call it whatever term you want but there are neighborhoods we have communities of people who don't want to integrate don't want to assimilate
the potential two thousand and sixteen contender has racked up significant media coverage since he first said he first talked about no go zones in european cities on monday
he has also continually emphasized that his comments are indeed controversial
jindal also criticized president barack obama accusing him of not labeling the attackers in paris as terrorists though obama had swiftly condemned the attacks as a terrorist act

europeans use lawsuits laughter to knock down no go claims
obama has however taken heat from jindal and other republicans for staying away from labeling the terrorist threat as radical islam
we're at war with radical islam whether he wants to call it or not jindal said on wednesday
drawing on his indian heritage jindal insisted that the race or religion of immigrants is not what's important but that immigrants to the u.s. must learn english and integrate and assimilate to american culture
it used to be ok to call america the melting pot now the politically correct one wants to say look we can't impose our culture on others we can't impose our values on others that's nonsense jindal said
two senior house gop aides tell cnn that after discussions with members on wednesday night they are no longer voting on the late term abortion bill and are now voting instead on a bill banning taxpayer money for abortions
some concerns were raised by men and women members that still need to be worked out one of the aides told cnn
tomorrow we will vote to advance the pro life cause and remain committed to continue working through the process on pain capable to make sure it too is successful
a similar measure that calls for banning taxpayer money for abortions passed the gop controlled house last year
rep. pete sessions chairman of the rules committee which met on wednesday night to address the matter said the decision to change plans came after discussions with members throughout the day
it's my hope that this resolution will address the concerns of our members and will allow us to move forward to where we are able to consider this important legislation to discuss it on the floor and to move it forward he said
democratic rep. jim mcgovern said the bill led to a meltdown in the republican conference and criticized the decision to take up the alternate measure that had previously passed
maybe we can <unk> your testimony from last year mcgovern said <unk> adding we've done this before
the rebellion was initially headed up by a group of female house republicans that pointed out the vote could threaten the party's efforts to reach out to women and young people
the pain capable unborn child protection act is a bill banning so called late term abortions those involving procedures for women who are beyond twenty weeks into their pregnancy
several house gop women protested language in the bill that requires those women who seek an exception to the ban because they were raped have to back up their claim with a police report
a similar measure has passed the house in two thousand and thirteen but this time some female members including some who voted for it last time are pushing for that requirement to be stripped out
discussion about the issue at a closed door meeting on wednesday morning got so tense that congressional aides were kicked out of the meeting when the debate turned emotional according to several gop sources
the internal feud placed leaders in an awkward spot because they targeted the vote for thursday the same day as the march for life in washington and the forty two nd anniversary of the landmark supreme court decision roe v. wade which <unk> state laws that prevented a woman from having an abortion based on the constitutional right to privacy
on tuesday two female republicans rep. renee ellmers of north carolina and rep. jackie <unk> of indiana removed themselves as <unk> of the legislation
<unk> later posted on her facebook page that she would vote for the bill but she declined to comment on the issue further
out of the two hundred and forty six republicans in the house twenty two are women
cnn reached out to several female house gop members who were seen <unk> on the house floor during votes on wednesday but most declined to talk about their talks with leaders
missouri rep. <unk> <unk> supports the bill
when asked about the discussions about the rape provisions she told cnn we're just figuring out the best way to get it passed in the long run
we will figure that out
arizona gop rep. trent franks the primary author of the bill had predicted the bill could pass if the language regarding rape stays in the bill
he maintained that public opinion polls demonstrate americans of all ages back his legislation
everything that i know about <unk> voters the younger voters is that they are more pro life than us old guys franks said

before that stop was over the officers had seized one hundred thousand dollar which the men said was money to play poker
the <unk> also called ahead to california authorities who raided the men's homes and ultimately indicted one of them john <unk> on a charge of illegal possession of drug paraphernalia
if this sounds unusual and way out of the ordinary it isn't
the seizure is just one of thousands of highway stops that state and local authorities call <unk>
roadside stops aimed at catching drug dealers or even terrorists but which can also result in cash seizures alone with no criminal charges attached
it's called civil asset <unk> and it was started in the early one thousand nine hundred and eighty s by the justice department
it has since <unk> to thousands of state and local <unk> nationwide
the program when it originated was meant to target and take money authorities believed was connected to crimes
a legal advocacy group based in washington called the institute for justice has been battling civil asset <unk> for years
it violates due process for americans said larry <unk> an attorney for the group
it's wrong
it's a simple premise that the government should not be taking money from people who have done nothing wrong
it shouldn't be taking money from people who have not been charged let alone convicted of any crime
in the case of the two poker players in iowa months after their money was taken they reached a settlement in which most of the money ninety thousand dollar was returned
they told cnn they believed it was the best deal they could have made at the time
now however they are suing to get the rest of the money back and have asked for unspecified damages
the state of iowa isn't giving it back and is not backing down
it has had widespread and deep impacts on my life said william bart davis one of the two poker players
it's my primary focus right now
it's made me aware of the things i was unaware of
and made me angry
in a small nevada county two hours driving time east of <unk> a single deputy sheriff has been responsible for more than a dozen cash seizures in two thousand and fourteen alone according to a lawsuit filed on behalf of motorists whose money was taken
that deputy lee dove asks one <unk> in a dash cam video how much money he has on hand
when the driver answers dove said quote it's not counted is it
well i'm seizing it
dove was so proud of his cash seizures that he <unk> photos of himself with a bundle of money at his feet accompanied by his k nine dog
cnn wanted to ask him about the seizures but he didn't answer when our team approached his security gate just after <unk>
as we were driving away a few minutes later two <unk> county sheriff's deputies pulled us over even though we hadn't done anything wrong
one of them said their colleague dove had been going through a tough time and had called them to complain about our presence
the newly elected sheriff in <unk> county mike allen said dove is still with the department but has been placed on administrative leave pending the outcome of a state investigation
allen said the entire program is suspended pending that investigation and that any future stops must have a clear connection to criminal activity
i want to know what crime they're investigating and what evidence do they have to <unk> that crime before any property is seized allen said
the justice department recently said it was backing away from the civil asset <unk> actions it had been taking for nearly three decades
its records show it seized more than six million dollar in the most recent fiscal year
now the department says it won't benefit from most seizures any longer
with this new policy effective immediately the justice department is taking an important step to prohibit federal agency <unk> of state and local seizures except for public safety reasons said attorney general eric holder
critics like the institute for justice however say that doesn't mean the elimination of the practice
the <unk> president scott <unk> predicted it will continue in most states around the country
the fbi has completed its investigation into the august shooting in ferguson missouri and sent the findings to the justice department a law enforcement official and a separate u.s. official said wednesday
justice department prosecutors will not recommend civil rights charges against wilson who killed brown because there is not sufficient evidence to support charges a u.s. official told cnn
the new york times first reported the development wednesday
a grand jury decided not to indict wilson on state charges in november
however the final justice department report has not been completed
the fbi joined local officials in interviewing over two hundred people and looked at much the same evidence as the grand jury
what are the brown family's options
ultimately the decision will be made by attorney general eric holder who has said he will announce a decision before he leaves office which is expected to be by spring
another justice department civil rights investigation into the ferguson police department's overall track record with minorities is ongoing
benjamin crump an attorney for brown's family declined to comment on the news wednesday
the family of michael brown jr. will wait for official word from the justice department regarding whether or not any charges will be filed against the police officer who shot and killed him crump said in a written statement released wednesday
the family won't address speculation from anonymous sources
months of protests over alleged police brutality and racial profiling surged in ferguson and across the country after wilson a white officer killed brown an unarmed african american teen
legal experts have long noted that a federal civil rights case against wilson would be more difficult to prove
the bar is extraordinarily high said joey jackson a criminal defense attorney and legal analyst for cnn's sister network hln
you have to show an intentional deprivation of a civil right
given how difficult it is to prove intent and also how many conflicting accounts emerged from the grand jury investigation it would be very difficult to move forward federally with a civil rights charge jackson said
if no federal charges are brought against wilson who resigned from his position as a ferguson police officer in november some people in the area will be disappointed said antonio french a st. louis city <unk> who lives near ferguson
i think you have a lot of people who will be disappointed if this does turn out to be the case
the community and the family wanted a day in court an opportunity to see all the evidence laid out cross examined french said
and it looks like that's not going to happen
i hope we don't have any violence as a result of this
violent protests erupted in ferguson after the grand jury's decision not to indict wilson in november
police are still searching for suspects accused of looting
protests aren't likely to stop any time soon french said
people have a right to protest
we will probably continue to see that
that's a good thing
but we want to keep them peaceful nonviolent he said
because violence makes the situation worse
it divides the community in a time we need to come together and make everyone feel like they can get equal protection
ultimately he said some of the protesters goals can be achieved outside the courts
the next steps i think are legislative change french said trying to make sure that in cases like this we get a special prosecutor by law and to create a new level of civilian oversight over police departments
in his state of the state speech on wednesday missouri gov
jay nixon said addressing the broader systemic issues raised by the unrest that followed the killing of brown would demand sustained effort
the legacy of ferguson will be determined by what we do next
to foster healing and hope
and the changes we make to strengthen all of our communities he said
due to a recent measles outbreak several disneyland workers are being tested for the virus
five employees were diagnosed with measles and three of them have fully recovered disneyland says
the measles outbreak exposure period of december seventeen twenty at the disneyland resort is over and all cases from this exposure should have occurred by january ten two thousand and fifteen the california department of public health says
no new cases have been identified in guests who visited after that time period
disneyland said it was informed of measles cases among employees on january fifteen
measles is a respiratory disease caused by a virus and spread through the air according to the centers for disease control and prevention
as for symptoms measles starts with a fever runny nose cough red eyes and sore throat the cdc says
the outbreak apparently surfaced with five disney employees who were diagnosed with measles three who have fully recovered disneyland says
disneyland said it was informed of measles cases among employees on january fifteen
previously public health officials in california and utah confirmed nine cases among visitors to either disneyland or disney california adventure park
after orange county health officials notified disneyland of that on january seven we immediately began to communicate to our cast to raise awareness the theme park's chief medical officer dr. pamela <unk> said in a statement
disneyland refers to its employees as cast members
in an abundance of caution we also offered vaccinations and immunity tests
to date a few cast members have tested positive and some have been medically cleared and returned to work
cast members who may have come in contact with those who were positive are being tested for the virus
while awaiting results they have been put on paid leave until medically cleared
it's not clear how many of the theme park employees were vaccinated
so far five children and thirteen adults have been diagnosed with measles in orange county according to the county health agency
one school in huntington beach has barred children who could not prove that they were vaccinated for measles from going to school until january twenty nine according to the county health agency
those showing measles symptoms shouldn't be <unk> about seeing their doctor because a full body rash is likely to break out next
if you have symptoms and believe you may have been exposed please contact your health care provider said dr. ron chapman director of the state health department
two doses of measles containing vaccine are more than ninety nine percent effective in preventing measles the press release said
measles vaccines have been available in the united states since one thousand nine hundred and sixty three and two doses have been recommended since one thousand nine hundred and eighty nine
measles was considered eliminated in the united states in two thousand though two thousand and fourteen saw a record breaking number of confirmed cases
six hundred and forty four from twenty seven states according to the cdc
that's the highest number of cases since measles elimination was documented in the u.s. in two thousand the cdc says on its website
travelers to areas where measles is endemic can bring measles back to the u.s. resulting in limited domestic transmission of measles read a statement from the california department of public health
disney and other theme parks in california are international attractions and visitors come from many parts of the world including those where measles is endemic
five things to know about measles
iran backed rebels of the shiite houthi sect sparked alarm in washington after seizing a presidential palace in the volatile sunni majority nation in what officials called a coup
there are now signs that the rebels which have been resistant to american anti terror efforts despite a common <unk> to al qaeda and the u.s. backed government of president abdu rabu mansour hadi have agreed a deal to end the crisis
but the situation remains volatile and a reminder of how the intricate shifting and <unk> tribal and sectarian divides of the middle east often <unk> u.s. efforts to frame <unk> anti terror policy
obama has spent much of his administration sponsoring a political transition designed to restore stability in yemen and to cap the <unk> that sustains al qaeda in the arabian peninsula
washington has offered counter terrorism training to the government in the yemeni capital sanaa and has also mounted a campaign of drone strikes against key aqap leaders
the group is regarded by u.s. officials as the most potent offspring of osama bin laden's jihadist movement and has claimed responsibility for the attack on the french satirical magazine charlie hebdo this month
aqap also almost succeeded in bringing down a united states commercial jet over detroit on christmas day two thousand and nine and has tried to attack the u.s. mainland on at least two other occasions
the group's potential was underlined in a video released on wednesday in which a senior leader of aqap in yemen nasser bin ali al ansi said it was better for jihadists to wage war in their home nations rather than fighting on the front lines in syria
the message will alarm western governments fearful that muslim extremists radicalized at home or who have fought in syria iraq or yemen are plotting new attacks in the wake of the paris carnage
cnn's brian todd reported that meanwhile isis al qaeda's jihadist rival was now also beginning to establish a presence in the country
yemen which borders the red sea and the strategically important gulf of aden a major oil transit route sits next to key u.s. allies saudi arabia and oman
but it is also important <unk> for the obama administration
in a speech in september on combating isis obama held up u.s. operations in yemen as an example for a new anti terror doctrine which does not rely on sending troops into dangerous foreign <unk>
this strategy of taking out terrorists who threaten us while supporting partners on the front lines is one that we have successfully pursued in yemen and somalia for years obama said
obama vowed to use force against anyone who threatens america's core interests but to mobilize partners wherever possible to address broader challenges to international order
the obvious problem with that strategy is that it needs secure powerful local partners to have a hope of working
in failed states like syria and yemen those partners often do not exist or are like hadi are deeply vulnerable
stephen <unk> a former career foreign service officer who served as u.s
ambassador to yemen between two thousand and seven and two thousand and ten said the current situation was bad news for the white house
the hadi government has been a good partner of ours in the counter terrorism arena he said
if you move president hadi from the equation then i think all bets are off in many respects
after fighting raged in the streets of sanaa and a u.s. diplomatic vehicle was caught in the <unk> the pentagon moved two ships within range of the country in case the state department gives the order for an evacuation of the embassy
with memories of the raid by extremists on u.s. compounds in benghazi on sept. eleven two thousand and twelve which killed four americans still haunting the administration and fears of a hostage drama no one wants to take chances

isis gaining ground in yemen
but the white house faces a tough decision as it seeks to preserve limited influence that it still has on the ground in yemen
if we were forced to close down in sanaa the embassy this would be a major foreign policy defeat cnn intelligence analyst robert baer told wolf blitzer
we need a government in that country to crack down on al qaeda
you can not do this from the air or the national security agency can not just intercept intelligence
we need a strong central government whether it is a houthi one or an independent one
white house spokesman josh earnest said wednesday that the safety of embassy personnel in sanaa was a top priority
he also made clear that preserving anti terror cooperation in yemen was also vital
but the long term u.s. diplomatic posture in yemen is unclear
the fact that al qaeda is a common enemy of washington and the houthis raises the intriguing suggestion of possible cooperation
but any tie up would likely be <unk> and covert and washington would have trouble publicly recognizing any houthi regime
mohammed albasha a spokesman for the yemeni embassy in washington said americans should care about the houthis
we need to find out a way for the houthis and the government to co exist
they are now a fact of life he told cnn
charles <unk> an expert on yemen and professor at <unk> university said the fallout from the apparent coup against hadi was a mixed bag for the united states
the houthi are <unk> anti al qaeda
they have gone after al qaeda like no one has before
there is a certain coincidence of interest with the u.s. with the houthis against al qaeda he said
the houthi have done nothing to even slightly <unk> the americans
they have been very careful not to do anything like that
the americans are very much leaving the door open
<unk> <unk> an adviser on middle eastern and south asian affairs for <unk> a global intelligence and advisory firm said that the houthi movement could not be ignored
it is not clear to me to what extent washington has relations with the houthi movement
but now effectively the houthis are <unk>
while they do not dominate yemen they control the largest piece of real estate and they are the single largest group <unk> said
the level of iran's support for the houthi movement beyond rhetorical backing is in question
tehran's intelligence resources are already stretched by the syrian crisis and its finances have been hampered by western nuclear sanctions and the fall in the price of oil
iran however has spent years spreading its influence throughout the region in its wider proxy battle with its rival saudi arabia an important u.s. ally and now sponsors or heavily influences governments or key political forces in damascus beirut and baghdad as well as sanaa
the complex web of tribal and sectarian forces scrambling alliances and traditional alliances in yemen represent the region in <unk> and reflects massive challenges facing u.s. officials in search of a working policy
we don't have a lot of leverage in there at the moment <unk> said
there are so many forces and counter forces at play none of which we or anyone controls effectively he said
there are currents and issues and long standing hostility they are going to have to work themselves to some extent
as violence flares seven things to know about yemen
in the seventy minute long address the president gave only lip service to immigration reform
he made no remarks on protecting social security and medicare just as republicans have hinted at a coming battle over welfare reform and only passing reference to the <unk> achievement of his first term obamacare just as it's beginning to bear fruit for many americans
and he didn't mention the controversial keystone xl oil pipeline by name which republicans favor as a job creation opportunity but the white house has said obama would veto
the speech was overall a rallying cry to progressives a promise that he'll put up a fight for their priorities now that he's freed from the bounds of another reelection fight
it drew widespread praise from congressional democrats and near uniform dismissal from republicans
but the <unk> were a reminder that though the president's popularity is on an <unk> his legacy remains unclear and his final two years in office will still be full of challenges
the immigration reform snub was perhaps his most glaring hole
obama only warned against <unk> past battles on immigration when we've got a system to fix and called for empathy towards immigrants
yes passions still fly on immigration but surely we can all see something of ourselves in the striving young student and agree that no one benefits when a hardworking mom is taken from her child and that it's possible to shape a law that <unk> our tradition as a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants he said during tuesday night's speech
that's in contrast to his two thousand and thirteen state of the union speech when he called for congress to pass a comprehensive reform bill and declared
let's get this done
even last year he demanded let's get immigration reform done this year
on this issue however obama may be feeling less urgency because he's already done some of the work on his own with his executive action delaying deportations for millions of immigrant families last year
but the omission underscores what a prickly subject it remains politically one that's already the center of another spending fight on capitol hill that will come to a head next month
last year obama used a sizable chunk of his sotu to highlight the benefits americans would receive from the affordable care act even as the botched rollout of healthcare.gov drew months of negative headlines and created headaches for vulnerable democrats on the campaign trail
this year obama's only hint at reform was his declaration that in the past year alone about ten million uninsured americans finally gained the security of health coverage
that silence comes despite the fact at least six point four million americans signed up for coverage under the law during this year's enrollment period a significant spike from last year
but obamacare still remains unpopular with the real clear politics average of polls showing a majority of americans still oppose it
with gop attention focused elsewhere the best course for the president on that issue may be to let sleeping dogs lie especially as many americans may face penalties when they file their taxes this year because of the law
obama also left off a pair of progressive pet priorities that have gotten bigger play before gun control and campaign finance reform
with the senate in democratic hands last year obama pledged to keep trying to reduce gun violence
this year he avoided the topic altogether
and though the speech came on the eve of the fifth anniversary of the supreme court's citizens united decision which opened the floodgates for big money donors to influence elections obama didn't talk about super pacs or public financing for campaigns
still with historic references to transgender and lesbian individuals and a call for tax hikes on the wealthy most progressives had little to complain about on tuesday night
the disturbing information comes from a yemeni official who told cnn on wednesday that isis has a presence in at least three provinces in southern and central yemen and there is now a real competition between isis and the yemen based terror group al qaeda in the arabian peninsula or aqap
that competition <unk> itself in a gun battle between the two groups in yemen's eastern provinces last month the same official said though he did not have specifics on the casualties that resulted from that incident
american officials do think isis is trying to recruit in yemen
but one u.s. counter terror official stressed the view that aqap remains the dominant force there
the american intelligence view is that while there may be a smattering of isis loyalists among sunni extremists in yemen they are likely mid level aqap militants who are sympathetic to isil's vision but haven't broken ranks
according to some experts isis may be seeking a foothold in the middle <unk> poorest country because of its historical importance
yemen is significant in islam said katherine zimmerman a research fellow at the american enterprise institute
it is a place where we've seen attacks against the united states
it also has been a major <unk> for foreign fighters into afghanistan into iraq and now into syria zimmerman added there's a recruiting pipeline that isis may try and tap into
the yemeni official who spoke to cnn said aqap is still the dominant terrorist presence in yemen with hundreds of members compared to dozens for isis
still he added there's a new kid on the block
as violence flares seven things to know about yemen
and isis may be using its financial strength to win over some of aqap's potential recruits
the yemeni official told cnn that isis supporters are telling potential recruits they can fund operations better than aqap can at the moment
u.s. officials have long expressed concerns about isis financial strength which it <unk> from the export of stolen oil ransom payments from hostages criminal activities and foreign donors
for this reason the u.s. treasury department has undertaken aggressive efforts to cut the group off from the international financial system
news of isis inroads in yemen comes as violence is <unk> through the capital of sana'a where government troops are fighting houthi rebels that are taking control of government facilities
that violence is causing concern within the obama administration who count on the yemeni administration as key allies in the middle east
some institutions of government have broken down and are in trouble u.s. secretary of state john kerry conceded at a press conference on wednesday
still kerry emphasized that president <unk> <unk> mansour hadi remains in power and u.s. personnel are well protected
the yemeni official tells cnn his government has not noticed significant aqap movement in sana'a during this time which is he said surprising
but aqap's top leaders are still actively plotting the official said and still have ambitions of attacking the west
i think the target as we initially saw is going to be the europeans simply because of their ease to get onto the continent said kirk <unk> former commander of the <unk>
cole
but ultimately their aim is the united states
the u.s. intelligence community is actively working to track down aqap's leaders according to a u.s. counterterrorism official
these leaders include founder <unk> al wuhayshi and notorious <unk> ibrahim al <unk> the mastermind of both the christmas day underwear bomb plot in two thousand and nine and a more recent attempt to put bombs in printer cartridges
nevertheless the yemeni official cautioned given the pressure aqap has been under in recent months is is now engaging more in its pre two thousand and eleven tactics of <unk> smaller cells and dispersed operatives
their main activities these days are targeted assassinations of houthis and yemeni government and military officials he added
but officials and analysts worry aqap and isis competition in yemen could create a dynamic wherein the groups compete to strike the u.s. first and hardest
it could lead an attack against the u.s. embassy in <unk> which is vulnerable said zimmerman
and it could also direct its attention <unk> to saudi arabia

while some might say this shows a lack of respect for the <unk> wawrinka believes their authority has already been undermined by an over reliance on the hawk eye electronic line judging system which was first introduced at a top level tennis tournament late in two thousand and five
<unk> who retired in two thousand and twelve recently called for hawk eye to be scrapped arguing that controversial arguments between players and <unk> helped to boost tv ratings and draw crowds to tennis matches
it's helped a lot for the players to make sure the call is right and you can prove it
wawrinka told cnn's open court
but it doesn't help the umpire at all anymore
they don't really take control of the match leaving it to the players and hawk eye
they don't have to take responsibility for mistakes he added
the world no
four also pointed to an <unk> whereby many matches on the atp tour are played on outside courts without the system installed leading to <unk> being caught between two styles of <unk>
when an umpire is used to not taking responsibility and not <unk> when the match is played on a smaller court he's not going to do anything
that's not good for the game said wawrinka
the swiss star is seemingly not adverse to having it out with <unk> in the heat of the moment
yes it's good it makes you pumped said the twenty nine year old wawrinka
last year in his australian open four set final victory over rafael nadal wawrinka became embroiled in a spat with the chair umpire after the spaniard left the court to have treatment on his injured back without the swiss player being told the nature of the injury
if he's off you have to tell me why
wawrinka shouted
a year later wawrinka is playing down his chances of repeating that two thousand and fourteen triumph picking world no
one novak djokovic as the big favorite along with his compatriot and seventeen time grand slam champion roger federer
the pair combined to help switzerland win the davis cup for the first time beating france in last month's final
it was an amazing feeling especially winning like that with roger on the team said wawrinka
wawrinka who plays <unk> <unk> <unk> thursday believes he has the <unk> to beat any of the top three as he did last year in seeing of djokovic and nadal in successive matches in melbourne
when i go on the court against roger rafa or novak
i know i can beat him and how i made this happen
the confidence comes from his tremendous performances in two thousand and fourteen with his first masters one thousand success coming on the clay of <unk> carlo to be added to his australian open and davis cup triumphs
it elevated stan to superstar status around the world and he admits it was difficult to adjust to his new found fame as he suffered some surprise losses among the <unk> victories
i think for sure last year everything changed
it's a different level as you know when you win a grand slam you are part of the history of tennis
i had to adapt a little bit especially mentally to find my way to be the same on the court and off the court that's why i had some up and down days all the year
another release valve has been social media with wawrinka regularly updating his twitter account to keep his fans in touch with his progress
it's a little bit more private because you can say or give what you want picture different picture he said
so sure enough when wawrinka made a successful defense of his <unk> open title in india his final <unk> before the australian open he was quickly tweeting

in a new book guantnamo diary slahi paints a horrifying picture of life at the hands of interrogators in the notorious u.s. military prison in cuba
the book depicts long days in isolation sometimes chained to the floor in agonizing positions held in extreme temperatures often deprived of food and sleep
on multiple occasions he describes being beaten and <unk> by his <unk>
he says he was left shaking like a parkinson's patient and felt one of his interrogators was literally executing me but in a slow way
the forty four year old electrical engineer originally from <unk> has been held in guantnamo bay since two thousand and two
he was accused of being a member of al qaeda and of recruiting three of the hijackers in the nine eleven terrorist attacks as well as being involved in other terror plots in canada and the united states
he's never been charged and his lawyers say there is very little evidence against him
slahi admits to traveling to afghanistan to fight in the early one thousand nine hundred and ninety s when the u.s. was supporting the <unk> in their fight against the soviet union
he pledged allegiance to al qaeda in one thousand nine hundred and ninety one but claims he broke ties with the group shortly after
the u.s. military continues to hold slahi as an enemy <unk> under the authorization for the use of military force of two thousand and one informed by the laws of war according to department of defense spokesman lt. col. <unk> <unk>
guantnamo diary is the first published account from a serving detainee which is being made available to the public
slahi hand wrote the <unk> in his cell in two thousand and five and it took nearly seven years for slahi's lawyers to get it approved for release
he describes his first few years of detention in what he calls his endless world tour of interrogation from <unk> to jordan to afghanistan and finally cuba
in his early years at guantnamo slahi was exposed to a number of special interrogation techniques that were personally signed off by then secretary of defense donald <unk> according to reports by the armed services committee and the department of justice
that included sensory and sleep deprivation designed to grind him down which <unk> havoc on his physical and mental health
i couldn't tell a thing about days going by or time passing
my time consisted of a crazy darkness all the time slahi writes
i was starved for long periods and then given food but not given time to eat
you have three minutes
eat
a guard would yell at me and then after about half a minute he would grab the plate
you're <unk>
slahi says the brutality reached a peak in late two thousand and three
i thought they were going to execute me slahi writes
thanks to the beating i wasn't able to stand so redacted and the other guard dragged me out with my toes tracing the way and threw me in the truck which immediately took off
the beating party would go on for the next three or four hours
this period culminated in him being taken on a boat ride during which he was blindfolded and he says beaten for several hours
it was during this time that slahi says he began to make false confessions in order to stop the torture
at one point he says to his <unk> just tell me the right answer
is it good to say yes or to say no
responding to slahi's allegations of torture <unk> the pentagon spokesman pointed to a number of investigations into guantnamo detainee treatment
many of slahi's claims are corroborated by reports published by the u.s. senate armed services committee and the department of justice in two thousand and eight
the boat incident which slahi describes in detail is mentioned in both reports although neither provide complete details about what happened during this trip
<unk> also said slahi is eligible to appear before a periodic review board to assess whether his continued detention at guantanamo remains necessary
even in its published form portions of slahi's account are redacted
the u.s. department of defense says this was necessary to protect u.s. personnel and national security
in some sections of the book several pages at a time are completely blacked out
slahi's lawyers hope the book will build pressure on the government to finally let him go
in two thousand and ten a district court judge ruled he was being held <unk> and ordered his immediate release
but the government appealed that decision and the case has been in legal limbo ever since
unfortunately for the government and fortunately for the rest of us these secrets are out now slahi's lawyer nancy <unk> told cnn
the united states can't keep secret these things that it does any longer and it needs to close guantanamo
it's as simple as that
when u.s. president barack obama took office in two thousand and eight he promised to close guantnamo but as he enters his seventh year in the white house one hundred and twenty two prisoners remain
at its peak there were more than seven hundred
in tuesday's state of the union address obama said his administration will work to finally finish the job and close it down
as americans we have a profound commitment to justice so it makes no sense to spend three million dollar per prisoner to keep open a prison that the world condemns and terrorists use to recruit obama said
i will not <unk> in my determination to shut it down
it's not who we are
it's time to close gitmo
in a country as young as the united states it's no wonder that we celebrate nearly every big anniversary that comes along whether it's twenty five fifty or seventy five years
to narrow the birthday list down we chose ten great two thousand and fifteen <unk> across the country

president obama delivered a tough state of the union address that offered some solace to democrats who feared he had given up the fight
most importantly he put forth a controversial plan to tax wealthier americans through reforms that close loopholes in order to finance tax cuts for middle class americans tapping into the populist sentiment that has driven support for politicians like sen. elizabeth warren
yet democrats should not get too excited
speeches can be moving and they certainly can inspire but the situation on capitol hill remains dire for proponents of liberal reform
republicans are in firm control of the house and senate and the gop has steadily drifted to the right
congressional republicans have proven that they know how to employ procedural tools to <unk> the president's progress
there are almost no indications that republicans are preparing to do some sudden about face and begin negotiating with the white house
the tax proposal will most likely get stifled in congress or the president will be forced to trade away the increases on the wealthy and end up simply giving tax cuts to all
hardly the stuff of progressive politics
the erosion of democratic strength in congress since two thousand and ten has been devastating to the party
the democratic congress was the driving force behind president obama's success in his first two years
even in his most spirited moments the president has found little room to maneuver
the situation is not any different today
in fact it is worse
republicans are also ready for a fight and with control of congress they'll be able to hit back hard

more importantly he described how the middle class can <unk> of that progress
he laid out sensible proposals and tools that the middle class can use <unk> the child care tax credit giving five hundred dollar tax credit to couples that work offering paid sick leave helping families pay down a mortgage and <unk> workers to save for retirement
many of these are proposals have had gop support in the past
can the republicans finally put politics aside and prove to the nation they have more in their legislative <unk> than just no
will they reject their well known yet destructive path that of a party that puts middle class voters those who need the most aside and fights for those at the very top who need the least
the president laid out the audacity of progress and an agenda for the future
for the sake of the nation and the survival of their own party republicans should have the audacity to at least meet him halfway

what a surreal state of the union speech that was
what a strange man president obama can be
his party has suffered a historic defeat in the midterm elections islamist terrorism is on the march and his approval ratings remain <unk>
and yet obama's speech suggested that he was on top of the world
celebrating mocking the opposition making promises well beyond his capacity to deliver and even pledging to colonize mars
it was a good speech well delivered
but it was also pure fantasy
the economy is not as good as he suggested
the labor force participation rate has fallen to a thirty six year low
he <unk> in the suffering of the russian people thanks to sanctions and then cheered the normalization of relations with cuba one <unk> among many
another example of his ability to inhabit two positions at once came when he first appealed for a new nicer politics and then in an <unk> remark reminded the republicans that he'd won two presidential elections
but his memory wasn't so great on some issues
the president celebrated gay marriage as a story of freedom and a civil right
yet he was opposed to it until just before the last election
and while he <unk> the need for men and women to be paid the same wages at the white house <unk> persist
we all know that obama is a good speaker and yes this was a fine speech
but it had elements of self <unk>
the people with the real power are the republicans
and they won't let obama treat the next two years like some vain victory lap

just hours before obama spoke iran backed rebels launched a coup against the u.s. backed president of yemen just on saudi arabia's doorstep
obama did not talk about that of course
the reality and obama knows it is that the global situation is dire and it has grown much worse since he took office

and obama took credit for the russian <unk> collapse although it is low oil prices that are hurting vladimir putin's russia more than u.s. policies
in fact the drop in oil will help u.s. foreign policy more than anything
obama can take credit for improving relations with cuba and <unk>
but claiming that his presidency has succeeded on the foreign policy front is simply incorrect

it was as if president obama completely missed the outcome of the november election
someone needs to tell him that his party no longer controls even one house in congress let alone both as was the case in two thousand and nine to two thousand and eleven
in his seventh state of the union address obama was as bold and audacious as ever
he spent the first part of the speech bragging about how his administration had <unk> saved the country from prolonged war decaying values and economic ruin and the second part laying out a wish list for what he believes still needs to be done in the remaining two years of his presidency to complete the salvation
normally americans might find this sort of thing refreshing i.e
a leader so committed to his principles that he won't <unk> in the policies even in the face of growing political opposition
yet that's not how this drama comes across
it's not refreshing
it's ridiculous
the president has just suffered a clear <unk> of his policies and instead of backing up and <unk> his strategy for getting things done in a landscape that has changed dramatically he's doubling down on his bet
that's not leadership

last night the president laid out his vision of progress for the country an agenda focused on expanding opportunity for all fighting for middle class families and moving the country's economy forward
as we heard president obama say at this moment with a growing economy shrinking deficits bustling industry and booming energy production we have risen from recession freer to write our own future than any other nation on earth
it's now up to us to choose who we want to be over the next fifteen years and for decades to come
what we also saw clearly was that democrats and republicans have two very different ideas about what we want that future to look like
this country has tried trickle down economics and it failed leaving many americans behind with policies that favored the richest among us
economic policies that are rooted in the middle class work and they ensure that everyone is able to benefit from this recovery
but still republicans continue to fight for only those at the very top and big corporations which <unk> are in line with their own financial and political self interest
while the president offered his vision for the country expanding opportunity where everyone gets a fair shot everyone does their fair share and everyone plays by the same set of rules republicans have shown time and again that they aren't interested in fighting for shared opportunity for all
just look at their striking refusal tonight to applaud things like access to education affordable child care or paid sick leave
the president has one more sotu to deliver
let's hope that next year both parties will find something to cheer about with regards to an improving economy for all
unfortunately a president who'd like to focus on the middle class can't escape the middle east
unlike last year's state of the union speech in which the president declared that america must move off a permanent war footing this time he couldn't <unk> the challenges that america faces in the broken angry dysfunctional middle east
recent jihadi terror attacks and plots in france and belgium
the houthi takeover of much of yemen
and isis's successes in syria and iraq simply wouldn't allow it
but make no mistake
when it comes to the middle east this president remains broadly risk averse
his remarks on foreign policy were more about continuity than change
sure the president proposed to negotiate a new authorization to use military force with congress
but if the language in <unk> speech is an indication such a new authorization will be quite consistent with what the united states is already doing training and equipping local allies and relying on air power rather than large numbers of u.s. forces
sure he talked tough on combating jihadi terrorists
but he will do this through what the president called smart leadership i.e
focused counterterrorism instead of his predecessor's nation building and deployment of thousands of ground forces
and sure he's rightly proud of the tough sanctions regime that brought iran to the negotiating table on its nuclear program
but as he indicated tonight he'll resist any congressional effort on new sanctions let alone force until it's clear that diplomacy has failed
rhetoric notwithstanding the president remains <unk> in chief determined to reduce america's middle east profile and to get the u.s. out of long and <unk> old wars into new ones

according to a recently released pew poll for the first time in five years seventy six percents of americans believe defending the u.s. against terrorism should be the top policy priority
yet the president virtually brushed past it without providing anything substantive discussion of national security
instead he <unk> to his bread and butter

he could have taken an in your face victory gap given his rising poll numbers and favorable economic news

he even tailored parts of his message to appeal to conservative talking points noting that he wanted all americans to contribute to and share in our country's success

the contrast between his willingness to forge greater connection with the cuban people contrasted sharply with the tv images of sen. marco rubio <unk> in his seat
nor did the president miss the chance to remind congress that it should begin the work of ending the embargo a position supported by a clear majority of americans
most <unk> the president touched on our country's most contentious issues immigration women's reproductive rights and race relations by noting that they had the potential to be unifying issues

for the first time he said the state of the union is strong something many americans are still slow to feel and democratic candidates in november failed to bring up
the unemployment rate is down more than one hundred and fifty thousand american troops are home and ten million more americans have health insurance than did when obama took office
he was optimistic and he had the <unk> to support it especially on his domestic policy

but the <unk> moments of his speech were the last three minutes or so
this is when obama showed again the man who won the presidency and re election in historic fashion
he defended religious freedom and included muslims in that conversation
he repeatedly spoke about equality for lgbt people and pointed out seven out of ten americans live in states where same sex marriage is legal
he brought up the racial tension in ferguson the concern for safety with our police force and again replaced the notion of a red america and a blue america with one of the united states of america something he did when he first burst onto the scene in two thousand and four at the democrat national convention in boston
at the end i found myself asking didn't the democrats lose in november
wasn't obama <unk> in an election where the senate flipped from democratic to republican
and yet there he was
confident
emboldened
optimistic
something we haven't seen in quite some time
but then again the country has not had some of the positive economic numbers it currently boasts in quite some time either
democrats in november <unk> the good domestic news
obama in january did not

the photo shows <unk> bachmann leader of pegida which translates in english to patriotic europeans against the islamization of the west
it appeared wednesday on the cover of german tabloid <unk>
bachmann resigned as chairman of the group following the backlash to the hitler photo as well as another image bachmann posted of a man in a ku klux klan <unk> with the caption three <unk> a day keeps the minorities away
i apologize to everybody who has felt attacked by my online postings
they were comments made without serious reflection which i would no longer express today
i am sorry that i thereby damaged the interests of our movement and draw the appropriate conclusion bachmann said in dresden
the selfie was an act of satire his spokeswoman <unk> <unk> said on facebook
while every citizen has the right to engage in satire she wrote insulting foreigners is not satirical
though bachmann apparently has deleted his own facebook account screen grabs published by numerous media outlets suggest bachmann posted the hitler photo in september while the kkk image is from two thousand and twelve
bachmann told <unk> i took the photo at the <unk> for the publication of the <unk> of the satire he's back
you need to be able to joke about things now and then
he's back or er <unk> <unk> da in german is a two thousand and twelve best selling satire based on hitler waking up in modern day berlin with no knowledge of what happened following world war ii
the <unk> was released long before september as january two thousand and thirteen news reports indicate seventy five thousand copies had already been sold
it appears the images gained traction not because of timeliness but because pegida has successfully organized weekly anti islamization demonstrations in dresden
police estimated that eighteen thousand people attended a january five rally while about twenty five thousand people showed up at a january twelve rally
monday's scheduled protest in dresden was canceled after police persuaded pegida to call it off following an isis <unk> targeting pegida's organizers the group wrote on the facebook page for its united kingdom branch
the police has canceled the rally in agreement with pegida because they can't guarantee the security and safety of participants after information of planned attacks by <unk> groups the facebook post said
in response to monday's cancellation <unk> the city of <unk> offshoot of pegida said it was organizing a rally expected to draw between thirty thousand and sixty thousand demonstrators according to german media
as many as four thousand police officers had been recruited from around the country in preparation for the event one news outlet reported
on its main facebook page which has more than one hundred and fifty five thousand likes pegida has stated its philosophy that citizens should wake from their slumber and recognize the danger in the islamic ideology
stop the radical <unk> islamization it urges
as a society we should give people the chance to integrate but we should not allow ourselves to be <unk> thereby losing our freedom and democracy
the group claims to have supporters in more than thirty german cities and eighteen countries in europe
a pegida group in norway also called for demonstrators to gather outside town hall in the capital oslo earlier this month to show support for the french and demonstrate opposition to what it calls the <unk> of norway
german justice minister <unk> <unk> and chancellor angela merkel have called on the group to cancel the rallies in dresden and other german cities
<unk> have taken place or been planned in <unk> dsseldorf hamburg munich dresden <unk> and berlin
during a january five demonstration germany's cologne cathedral turned off its lights in a symbolic rejection of the rally taking place in its shadow
<unk> forbrig a european analyst with the german marshall fund of the united states told cnn that the pegida's message resonated only in the dresden area where its ideas had fallen on particularly fertile soil
these protests are not so much fueled by fear of islam and fear of islamist attacks but by frustration at the cost of reunification about the way they are being integrated and represented since the fall of the berlin wall forbrig said
dresden already had a well established network of right wing extremists before pegida's emergence he said
it's more a case of east germans not entirely feeling at home in germany forbrig said
there is a feeling of second class citizenship and in order to be heard many east germans take to radical measures
democracy freedom of religion and speech are gifts that help define what it means to be fully human
but within any democracy there must exist a level of respectful restraint when challenging or debating <unk> religious values of the other
the islamic <unk> of not depicting the prophet mohammed in any human image is a sacred element of islam
for anyone muslim or non muslim to do so is to disrespect and <unk> a basic <unk> of the faith
what has happened tragically in france has provided other terrorists using religion as their selfish and <unk> calling card with a motive to kill in the name of god
the end result of this latest slaughter is the construction of a global arena <unk> freedom of speech against a time honored understanding of how to acknowledge the presence of the prophet mohammed in the world
those who bully abuse <unk> and kill using religion as the rationale for their actions are neither religious nor faithful to their abrahamic roots
theirs is a desire to pit muslims christians and jews against one another in a religious war that will <unk> years of hard won respectful <unk> dialogue between the three great abrahamic faiths
dialogue that has a place in creating a more <unk> and forgiving world
theirs is a desire to <unk> the genius of democracy freedom of speech and religion to create a false image of islam as a violent <unk> religion
nothing could be further from the truth
it is important to honor the lives lost in france and to remember that those murdered were jews christians and a muslim
terrorists kill not only for their own sick selfish motives but to create an environment where violence and hate will <unk> peace and reconciliation between the faiths
they endeavor to show that democracy and freedom of speech have no place in their warped understanding of the islamic world
je suis charlie is a phrase shared by millions yet we all must understand that with freedom of speech must also come a sense of respectful restraint in criticizing or <unk> the <unk> or values of another especially their religion during these tension filled times where sectarian violence is trying to rule the day
my <unk> colleague and nobel <unk> archbishop desmond tutu of south africa reminded me that the essence of being human is contained in the african word <unk> a person can only be a person through engagement with another i am because you are
we can only be fully human when we are bound by trust mutual respect and valuing the human dignity of another person
it is only by experiencing and embracing the other that we can be touched by the very hand of god made whole and made a new creation
it is only then that we can extend our reach beyond our grasp and begin to change the future of humanity in a culture of peace
at this moment in time christianity islam and judaism have a great opportunity to work together effectively with governments and civil societies currently in turmoil
the abrahamic faiths have the opportunity to re shape the world into a culture of peace rather than a world torn <unk> by violence extremism and political <unk>
christianity islam and judaism must become the bridge builders of this century to span the raging waters of human conflict
it is pure <unk> that has given birth to human behavior sustained by fear and hate rather than by love of god love of self and love of neighbor
it is this <unk> that takes the unconditional love of god for all human beings <unk> it and <unk> it into pieces of human interpretation that bear no resemblance to the core teachings of the one god of christianity islam and judaism as we know them
no person has the right to take the life of another person in the name of god
human beings who claim to represent the true teachings of christianity islam and judaism and who indiscriminately slaughter those who are the other have lost the most fundamental principle of their religious <unk> <unk>
they have lost the core of a compassionate and loving god
christians find direction in the new testament from one st john four eighteen
there is no fear in love but perfect love casts out fear
for fear has to do with punishment
and whoever fears has not reached perfection in love
those who say
i love god and hate their brothers and sisters who they have seen can not love god who they have not seen
the <unk> that we have from him is this

rabbi jonathan <unk> wrote
i believe that we are being <unk> by god to see in the human other a face of the divine other

who are hungry and poor and ignorant and <unk> whose human potential is being denied the chance to be expressed
that is the faith of abraham and sarah who with the great faiths judaism christianity and islam trace their spiritual or actual <unk>

saudi officials told cnn the punishment is an integral part of their system of islamic law and the only violation that took place at the macabre scene was the illegal filming of the act
the man responsible for the recording now faces charges of violating the country's cyber laws and will be tried a saudi official not authorized to speak on the case said
we emphasize respect for the right to life as one of the fundamental rights guaranteed by the law

a project <unk> by the ruling king abdullah to put laws into writing has ushered in a shift from the current <unk> system which provides judges with little guideline or <unk>

boko haram kidnapped german citizen robert <unk> eberhard in nigeria in july biya said in a statement read wednesday on state run broadcaster <unk>
he did not detail how when or where the rescue operation took place
a special operation of cameroonian armed forces and security services of friendly countries freed the man he said
eberhard told journalists he was glad to be alive
i am happy to see all these people around me who have rescued me and made sure that i survived because until the last minute i did not know whether i would survive or i would not survive
it was for me a big problem
because it was darkness total darkness and you see nobody around you
then this is a big problem to say ok i will survive or not survive eberhard said
eberhard was flown in from cameroon's far north region to <unk> shortly after noon wednesday
he said he was grateful to all those who worked to secure his release
the german ambassador to cameroon <unk> <unk> <unk> also thanked cameroonian authorities particularly because we could find a solution to this problem of hostage taking he said
eberhard spoke amid heavy security and mentioned that he was teaching at a <unk> school in gombe adamawa state nigeria before the insurgents took him hostage in july
he has been taken to the residence of the german ambassador in <unk>
the ambassador said initial medical care will be given to him before he is flown back to germany for more medical attention
biya said he was thankful to all those who directly or indirectly helped in the achievement
and particularly the german government for their precious contribution
he did not specify how germany participated
the german foreign office did not immediately respond to cnn's request for comment
<unk> <unk> <unk> chairwoman of the african union commission praised the decision of president idriss deby <unk> of chad at the request of cameroon to deploy troops in that country to contribute to the ongoing operations against the boko haram terrorist group
boko haram which has fought an anti government campaign in northeastern nigeria and parts of cameroon said previously that it was holding a german hostage
boko haram leader abubakar shekau said so in november in a video message denying nigeria's claims that it had struck a ceasefire deal with the group
it wasn't immediately clear if this was eberhard
the operation came days after about two thousand chadian troops arrived in cameroon to help fight the insurgents
boko haram which means western education is forbidden in the local <unk> <unk> has terrorized northern nigeria regularly since two thousand and nine attacking police schools churches and civilians and bombing government buildings
it has kidnapped students including more than two hundred schoolgirls who were abducted in northeastern nigeria in april and remain missing
the islamist group has attacked neighboring cameroon initially by crossing the border from nigeria to steal food or kidnap foreign nationals
more recently the group went after cameroonian military installations

boehner's tweet stated that the scheduling change was meant to accommodate netanyahu's request to attend the american israel public affairs committee conference in washington d.c
the new date march three is also two weeks before the israeli election
the meeting with congress was originally scheduled for feb. eleven
netanyahu has raised alarm bells about nuclear talks between the obama administration and iran
in the u.s. the iran talks are a topic that has pitted president barack obama against senior democrats in the senate one of whom accused the administration on wednesday of using talking points straight out of tehran
congressional leaders in both chambers are considering proposals to increase sanctions while international negotiators try to reach an agreement with iran over nuclear capabilities
the sanctions would not kick in unless certain benchmarks are met by june thirty but the white house has argued that a debate and vote now could derail the talks
obama will not meet with netanyahu when he visits in march national security council spokeswoman bernadette meehan said in a statement thursday
obama who has threatened a veto if a sanctions bill passes through congress used uncharacteristically frank language at a press conference last week to warn fellow democrats and republicans who support sanctions to hold their fire
far from holding their fire democrats who support a sanctions bill like sen. bob menendez d new jersey have increased their criticism of the white house
the more i hear from the administration and its quotes the more it sounds like talking points that come straight out of tehran railed menendez at a hearing with administration officials on capitol hill
boehner told reporters he did not consult with the white house about the invitation to netanyahu saying the congress can make this decision on its own
asked by cnn if this was a deliberate poke at the president boehner replied i don't believe i'm poking anyone in the eye
there is a serious threat that exists in the world and the president last night kind of <unk> over it
he added the fact is there needs to be a more serious conversation in america about how serious the threat is from radical islamic jihadists and from the threat posed by iran
boehner declined to say when the house would vote on another iran sanctions bill but said committees are planning hearings on the issue
multiple house gop aides say there are plans for a vote but the timing is still unclear
boehner announced his invitation for netanyahu to address congress about iran the day after president obama <unk> with congress during his state of the union address to allow the talks to progress
typically <unk> to foreign leaders to address congress are coordinated ahead of time with the white house but congressional sources said the speaker acted on his own
white house press secretary josh earnest told reporters on the way to idaho for an event with president obama that the white house is reserving judgment until they speak with the israelis and see what netanyahu plans to say before congress
boehner's team had been discussing this invite with netanyahu for weeks according to a house gop leadership source who added the reason driving the invitation was the administration's negotiations with iran
while they did not consult with the white house this republican aide said boehner's office did inform the white house this morning that netanyahu would be coming

the <unk> all <unk> had been in the form of his life at the two thousand and eleven cricket world cup helping india win their first title in almost three decades when they beat sri lanka by six <unk> in the final at <unk> <unk> stadium
yuvraj had particular cause to celebrate after putting in a series of match winning performances his tally of three hundred and sixty two runs and fifteen <unk> in nine matches earned him the man of the tournament award
everything came together at the world cup and it was something really special
and just being together as a team lifting the world cup was a dream come true yuvraj told cnn's human to hero series
but as each new chapter in that indian sporting fairy tale was being written a more <unk> narrative was unfolding deep inside <unk> body
i was coughing a lot
i was not able to breathe on my left side
i was struggling to breathe throughout the whole tournament spitting a little bit of blood at times during games he recalls
after the world cup he went for a scan that revealed a tumor in his chest <unk> but a combination of denial and disbelief saw him carry on pretty much as normal
even when i was diagnosed i kept ignoring it because i still wanted to play and i didn't believe it could happen to an athlete like me who had been training and keeps himself fit
so off he went on tour to england that summer and in november he played two test matches at home against the west <unk>
it was only the following january when results of further tests confirmed the tumor was malignant a <unk> cell cancer called a <unk> <unk> was diagnosed that yuvraj was forced to face his worst fears and seek treatment
it was located between my heart and my lung and it grew about fourteen centimeters like a ball over my chest which was a concern
yuvraj sought the expertise of lawrence <unk> a u.s. doctor who had successfully treated cyclist lance armstrong for testicular cancer in the one thousand nine hundred and ninety s and underwent chemotherapy at the <unk> simon cancer center in indianapolis in early two thousand and twelve
i had three sessions of chemotherapy so it was really tough it was hard to go through it
but while i was going through my treatment i was always motivated that i was going to come back and play for india
i think that's what kept me going and got me through
yuvraj had enjoyed a stellar career up to then playing test one day international and t twenty cricket for india making his senior debut in two thousand at the age of nineteen
a sparkling eighty four off eighty balls in his first <unk> in a one day match against australia served notice of his talent and it was in limited <unk> cricket that he was most at home on the international stage
the left <unk> has <unk> <unk> more than eight thousand one day runs which have included thirteen hundreds and fifty one half centuries and when he's on his game his assaults on opposition bowling attacks have displayed a brutal beauty
it was four years before his <unk> with bat and ball in two thousand and eleven that yuvraj had made himself a household name smashing six <unk> in an over off england <unk> stuart broad during the inaugural twenty twenty world cup
previously only <unk> <unk> had recorded such a feat in international cricket
i would say it's one of the biggest highlights of my career because wherever i go and whenever i speak to people or my friends they always mention they remember you hitting six <unk>
it's a very special moment in my <unk> career
unlike a lot of kids growing up in india where cricket is the national game yuvraj didn't care much for the sport preferring to play tennis and go roller skating during his early childhood in <unk> a small town five hours north of new delhi
but his father <unk> who had represented india at cricket in the early one thousand nine hundred and eighty s had other ideas and was hell bent on seeing his son following in his footsteps
my father was an international player but he didn't play much so he wanted to continue his dream through me
he pushed me a lot into cricket and i eventually started liking it and i think i was destined to play
the intense parental expectation of the elder singh is laid bare in <unk> autobiography
writing in the test of my life yuvraj recalls an incident when his father exploded with rage after hearing that his son had been dismissed in a practice match
i was once out for thirty nine hitting the ball in the air and dad got to hear about the dismissal
that evening he went back home and told mom tell <unk> not to enter the house or i will kill him yuvraj wrote in the book published in two thousand and thirteen
after spending the night in his car yuvraj returned to the house the next morning when his father had gone out
but then he unexpectedly came back
without warning he picked up the glass full of milk on the table and threw it straight at me
it missed my head and broke the glass <unk> of the window behind where i was sitting
then i received the full volley of his abuse
his father has had to deal with his own cancer diagnosis in recent months reportedly undergoing treatment for cancer of the vocal <unk> last year but happily yuvraj remains clear of the disease
his wish to represent his country again was granted when he returned to play in three tests against england at the end of two thousand and twelve and a string of one day and t twenty international appearances followed in two thousand and thirteen and last year
but as he's first to admit his form has been <unk> since recovering from cancer
i've had a little bit of up and down in the last two to three years and that was bound to happen and i've taken that in my stride
i've worked very hard on my game and i look forward to doing good things for india again
he would have been the <unk> choice for a place in india squad for next month's cricket world cup in australia and new zealand but he wasn't named in the fifteen man squad announced by india's national <unk> at the beginning of january
still the thirty three year old is still much in demand elsewhere
last season he was the most expensive player in the indian premier league auction snapped up for <unk> fourteen <unk> by the royal challengers <unk>
in addition to regular appearances for his state side <unk> he is kept busy with his cancer foundation <unk> which raises awareness and funds to fight the disease
i definitely think i'm inspiring a lot of people he says
trust me it's not easy to get out of it
it's something which kills you from inside and it takes a lot out of you your family members and your friends to see what you're going through
that's why i'm trying to motivate people and try to help them get their life back
it's a positive message from a man who could have been forgiven for letting his sporting career fade in the face of such trauma
but his love for cricket remains as strong as ever
it's a sport which never flows in one direction it's always up and down
you never know which way it's going to go
i just love the <unk>
while these cases are extremely rare it does beg the question of why gaming can lead to such excessive behavior
i have spent nearly three decades studying <unk> addiction and there are many studies published in both the medical and psychological literature showing that very excessive gaming can lead to a variety of health problems that range from repetitive strain injuries and obesity through to <unk> and visual hallucinations and addiction
i have to stress that there is lots of scientific research showing the many educational and therapeutic benefits of playing but there is definitely a small minority of gamers that develop problems as a result of gaming overuse
but what is it that makes gaming so compulsive and addictive for the small minority
for me addiction boils down to constant <unk> or put more simply being constantly rewarded while playing the game
gaming rewards can be physiological psychological social and in some cases financial
most of these rewards are at least to some extent unpredictable
not knowing when the next reward will come keeps some players in the game
in short they carry on gaming even though they may not have received an immediate reward
they simply hope that another reward is just around the corner and keep on playing
added to this is the shift over the last decade from standalone console gaming to massively multiplayer online games where games never end and gamers have to compete and or collaborate with other gamers in real time
many excessive gamers report that they hate logging off and leaving such games
they don't like it as they don't know what is going on in the game when they are not online
the last five years has seen large increase in the number of scientific studies on problematic gaming
in may two thousand and thirteen the american psychiatric association published the fifth edition of the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders
for the first time the dsm five included internet gaming disorder as a psychological condition that warrants future research
throughout my research career i have argued that although all addictions have particular and <unk> characteristics they share more <unk> than differences such as total preoccupation mood modification cravings tolerance withdrawal symptoms conflict with work education and other people and loss of control
these similarities likely reflect a common <unk> of addictive behavior
so when does a healthy enthusiasm turn into an addiction
at the simplest level healthy <unk> add to life and addictions take away from it
but how much is too much
this is difficult to answer as i know many gamers who play many hours every day without any detrimental effects
the dsm five lists nine criteria for igd
if any gamer <unk> five or more of the following criteria they would likely be diagnosed as having igd
preoccupation with internet games
withdrawal symptoms when internet gaming is taken away
the need to spend increasing amounts of time engaged in internet gaming unsuccessful attempts to control participation in internet gaming
loss of interest in hobbies and entertainment as a result of and with the exception of internet gaming
continued excessive use of internet games despite knowledge of <unk> problems
deception of family members therapists or others regarding the amount of internet gaming
use of the internet gaming to escape or relieve a negative mood
and loss of a significant relationship job or educational or career opportunity because of participation in internet games
the good news is that only a small minority of gamers suffer form igd
most online games are fun and exciting to play
but like any activity that is taken to excess in a minority of cases the activity can become addictive
any activity if done for days on end could lead to severe health problems and even death and gaming is no exception
instead of demonizing games we need to educate gamers about the potential dangers of very excessive use
called the open worm project the research brings together scientists and programmers from around the world with the aim of recreating the behavior of the common <unk> in a machine
the open source project recently had its first major breakthrough when its software modeled on the neurons of the worm's nervous system independently controlled a lego robot
the <unk> sensors without any prior programming made the robot behave in a similar fashion to c. elegans approaching and backing away from obstacles or stimulated by food
while the developers say it will be some time before the lego bot will be avoiding predators or searching for a mate scientists say the project shows that artificial intelligence or ai as it is known is coming out of the realm of science fiction
we've been working on it for four years and while we have a lot more to achieve it's been the most surprising project i've been involved in project coordinator stephen larson told cnn
it's certainly exceeded my expectations
with the worm's nose neurons replaced by a sonar sensor and the motor neurons running down both sides of the worm replicated on the left and right motors of the lego bot the robot could emulate the worm's biological wiring
larson said that while the open source project is still awaiting peer review and the scientists and researchers in the experiment are reluctant to make any bold claims about how closely it resembled biological behavior the result were nevertheless impressive
we definitely have further to go but i think what captures people's imagination is how much information we have managed to put together larson said
we know we have the correct number of neurons we have them connected together in roughly the same way that the animal has and they're organized in the same way in that there are some neurons that give out information and other neurons that receive information
we feel we've gone a long way down the road but we still know that there's a lot that's been left out and there are a lot of assumptions at the moment it represents one point in a line of <unk> improvements
i'd say we're only twenty to thirty percents of the way towards where we need to get
the project aims to digitally model the worm entirely in a virtual environment
creating a robot with an <unk> body complete with <unk> muscles
something with wheels that is rigid is an interesting application but it still falls short of <unk> the anatomy of the worm larson said
he said the scientific road map is to model the worm completely equipping it with the same physics right down to the cells in all the right places
while the c. elegans <unk> was chosen because of the simplicity of its biological structure the complexity of the experiment has been such that the team has had to narrow down the project to just a third of the worm's neurons restricting it to those parts of the worm's make up that would display behavior
the digital version of the worm will be released on the web in june this year allowing anyone with an interest to tinker with the project
larson said the open source and collaborative nature of the project has been key to its success allowing it to make fast progress over the four years of its existence
so far it's had input from more than sixty contributors from fifteen countries all of them bringing a unique take on the problems thrown up by the project
the project has now split into various sub teams all of them dealing with different elements
one team is looking at the physical and mechanical model while another is <unk> out the neurons and the muscles and their electrical models
the great part of the open source experiment is that the team can take onboard left field suggestions that push it beyond its boundaries
i'd say that this robot was just one of those left field suggestions larson said
a contributor was able to come along and re use our material put it up online
the fact that it caught so many people's attention was really a bit of a surprise
digital nose on a chip can sniff out cancer

valls said close to three thousand people in france with jihadist ties needed to be under surveillance and that the number of people with links to networks in iraq and syria had increased by one hundred and thirty percents in the past year
in response to the threat two thousand six hundred and eighty new jobs will be created of which intelligence services alone will account for one thousand one hundred he said
many of the new jobs will be dedicated to tackling the threat from online jihadism
france will allocate four hundred and twenty five million euros over the next three years to boost the fight against extremism valls said
these resources will be used to buy new equipment such as bulletproof vests and better weapons for police officers
valls also said a new bill would be presented in april aimed at reinforcing the intelligence services legal position in conducting surveillance
efforts for early detection of radicalization will be enhanced within the justice ministry he said
people charged with or convicted of acts of terrorism will be placed on a list and required to report trips abroad or changes of address
other measures are aimed at preventing radicalization in prisons and online
internet companies and social networks will be expected to cooperate closely with authorities valls said
the prime minister also detailed the consequences for those who attack the nation which may include removal from french territory for radical islamists or loss of french citizenship
the latter measure will need to be validated by the constitutional council on friday
the costs of the new anti terrorism provisions will be met through savings in other areas of public spending valls said
through these measures he concluded the government was sending a message of relentless determination to the french people
valls announcement comes as europe ramps up efforts against islamist extremism in the wake of the paris attacks
the attacks this month against the satirical charlie hebdo magazine and a kosher supermarket have turned the spotlight on links between radical islamists in europe and terror networks elsewhere
al qaeda's yemen affiliate al qaeda in the arabian peninsula has claimed to be behind the january seven massacre by gunmen said and cherif kouachi at the offices of charlie hebdo
and gunman amedy coulibaly who attacked the kosher grocery store on january nine proclaimed his allegiance to the islamic state in iraq and syria or isis
the suspects in the paris attacks may have urged their associates to leave france before the plot was carried out law enforcement sources told cnn
european authorities are concerned that about half a dozen people with ties to the terror suspects are believed to be in syria and could return to europe to launch more attacks the sources said
a western official added the recent arrests across europe are similar to the hyper <unk> after nine eleven in the united states
we've become hyper reactive to any suggestion of islamic extremism and are chasing a lot of ghosts out of an excess of caution the official said
some are legitimate and some are not
from antwerp to aleppo and back
europe's nightmare
in a video released this week a senior aqap leader and spokesman urged all would be jihadists to wage war at home when possible as opposed to traveling abroad
if he is capable to wage individual jihad in the western countries that fight islam such as america britain france canada and others of the countries that represent the head of disbelief in waging war against islam
if he is capable of that then that is better and more harmful said nasr ibn ali al ansi
he continued
but if that is impossible and he is able to serve his brothers on the front lines then let him <unk> for it is better
an off camera interviewer asked why attacks have <unk> in the united states
by the grace of allah the great the almighty we have made efforts in external work and the enemy knows the danger of that al ansi said
we are preparing and lurking for the enemies of allah
we <unk> the believers to do that
paris prosecutor franois molins told a news conference that progress has been made in the investigation into the attack carried out by coulibaly but less so in the probe into the kouachi brothers
molins identified four suspects still in custody as willy p. christophe r. <unk> g. and michael a. giving only the first initial of their last names and outlined details of the charges against them
none of the four men has been charged with <unk> in the kosher market attack
the first three willy p. christophe r. and <unk> g. were present when coulibaly bought the <unk> car that he used to reach the site of the attack
it was found parked near the porte de vincennes after the attack
the fingerprints of the fourth suspect named as michael a. were found on one of the weapons that police discovered in coulibaly's secret apartment in gentilly authorities say
his dna was also found on a glove discovered at the scene of the crime the prosecutor says
in the days leading up to the attack michael a. had exchanged three hundred and sixty two text messages and eighteen phone calls with coulibaly the prosecutor says
the two men met on january five four days before coulibaly's attack
the four men in custody all in their twenty s were among nine people arrested in a police operation friday
five other suspects held since friday were released monday night
amid heightened concern over the threat posed by radical islamists in europe belgium and germany have cracked down on alleged extremists in recent days
belgian authorities continue the hunt for the ringleader behind a terrorist cell targeted in <unk> raids last week in which two suspects died
the suspected key link between senior isis operatives in syria and the belgian terrorist cell belgian moroccan isis fighter abdelhamid abaaoud is still at large a senior belgian counterterrorism official said monday
his last known location was greece the official said
one line of inquiry being looked at is whether abaaoud tried to fake his own death last year while fighting with isis in syria so that he could disappear off the radar screen of western intelligence services
in october his family in brussels received word he had been <unk> his sister told a belgian newspaper
belgian investigators believe abaaoud rather than dying on the front lines traveled to greece and suspect he was communicating by phone from there with the terrorist cell in belgium
despite an international manhunt involving both american and european intelligence agencies abaaoud remains at large
the concern is he will return to syria before he can found
the belgian prosecutor's office meanwhile said wednesday that custody had been extended for three suspects arrested in last thursday's raids
all three are charged with participation at the activities of a terrorist group and violation of weapons laws
one is also charged with armed rebellion in a group with <unk>
that last is <unk> el bali who survived the police raid in verviers in which two suspects died
his attorney said he was not involved in terrorism but was simply in the wrong place at the wrong time
the greek authorities have also agreed to the extradition of an algerian suspect named as omar s. the belgian prosecutor's office said
the extradition could take place in the following days
when he arrives in belgium he will be brought before the investigating judge who will decide on an arrest warrant the prosecutor's office said
another suspect named as <unk> h was arrested tuesday and charged with participation in the activities of a terrorist group
he's due to appear before a brussels court on friday the prosecutor's office said
federal prosecutor eric van der sypt said last week that the alleged terror cell targeted in the <unk> raids was on the brink of an attack and planned to target police officers
meanwhile police in berlin <unk> and <unk> raided thirteen properties linked to suspected radical islamists overnight monday to tuesday
the raids are part of the investigation into two alleged islamists who were arrested friday identified as ismet d. and emin f. berlin police said
both of them are accused of providing logistical aid to isis
those subject to the raids have not yet been accused of any crimes but had contact with ismet d. and emin f. there are no indications that the group was preparing attacks in germany
coulibaly killed four hostages at the kosher grocery store in paris before police killed him
he's also believed to have killed a policewoman a day earlier
new surveillance video obtained by cnn purportedly shows coulibaly and hayat boumedienne believed currently to be in syria outside a jewish institution in paris
a source familiar with the ongoing investigation into the paris attacks says there is a high degree of confidence that the video shows coulibaly and boumedienne
the video was recorded at the end of august or beginning of september and stored on a security camera
the source says the nature of the video makes it clear that the couple were carrying out surveillance of possible targets for months before coulibaly launched his attack against the kosher supermarket
the video was stored because it showed possible signs of unusual activity at the location says the source
time is running out
isis put out a video tuesday giving the japanese government seventy two hours to pay two hundred million dollar or else kenji goto and haruna yukawa like other isis captives before them will be killed
japanese chief cabinet secretary yoshihide suga said wednesday that his government estimates the deadline will come at two fifty p.m. friday tokyo time
until then he said japanese officials are trying to save them
suga said his government will do its utmost to communicate with isis on the fate of goto and yukawa through a third party such as another nation's government or a local tribe
he didn't say whether japan would be willing to pay any ransom
absent such a private back and forth the japanese official voiced his government's stance publicly including its defense of a proposed aid package also <unk> at two hundred million dollar to help those who are contending with isis according to prime minister shinzo abe
abe has defended the aid package as needed to build up human capacities infrastructure and so on yet isis denounced it anyway in its recent video
japan's measures are absolutely not intending to kill muslim people unlike what the hostage takers claim suga said wednesday
we strongly urge them not to harm the two japanese nationals and immediately release them
goto and yukawa were last seen months ago disappearing in the same part of the world
while they had different professions the two knew and talked to each other said yukawa's friend nobuo kimoto
it was january two thousand and fourteen when kimoto met yukawa who told him about his dream of providing security for japanese ships in dangerous areas such as waters off somalia sometimes plagued by <unk>
three months later yukawa headed off to syria to gain combat and survival experience kimoto said
there yukawa met the man isis refers to as kenji goto jogo
goto is a freelance journalist who has worked for various japanese news organizations including reporting about the northern syrian battleground city of kobani which for weeks has been under siege by isis and other areas
goto gave yukawa insights on how to survive there kimoto said
he also introduced him to rebel fighters distinct from isis even though both were fighting against syrian president bashar al assad's forces some of whom talked about their need for ambulances to shuttle the injured
that plea spurred yukawa to start raising money for this cause after returning to japan according to his friend kimoto
i felt a chill when he said after returning home he felt in syria he was really living a life kimoto said
he seems to have felt satisfaction being there and living together with the locals
he went back to syria in july a trip that kimoto said he didn't know about at the time
kimoto said he had advised yukawa to focus on building up his private military company which provided armed security services and posted videos online of his activities in iraq and syria
yukawa forty two went missing and was captured sometime after that
goto met the same fate
while it's not known exactly when he became a hostage his last twitter post was on october twenty three
alaaeddin al zaim worked as a fixer for goto
speaking to cnn in turkey he said the journalist had reached out to him about going into isis controlled territory
i am not american i am not british
i'm japanese
i can go goto told the fixer
<unk> help reporters travel and connect with local contacts
al zaim refused believing the trip was too dangerous
another fixer agreed to take goto to isis al zaim said
before he left goto made a short video which cnn saw in which he explained his decision to travel was his and his alone
goto gave al zaim his phones and a list of numbers
he gave me this and asked me to call japanese wife his wife in japan his friends in japan
after one week if i don't hear any news of them or any connection i have to call them said al zaim who remembers seeing goto for the last time on october twenty five
after a week he said he hadn't heard from goto and so he made the call to his wife
al zaim who described goto as his brother praised his reporting work
he is the best journalist i met him and i work with him because he like military stories
he covered every time civilian and kids stories in syria
and also he is very strong
anytime he want to do his job very well
sometimes we are going to danger places he afraid
he tell me
this is my job
i am journalist
i have to do that
cnn could not immediately confirm the details of what al zaim said
what happens next for both men is up to isis
unfortunately it doesn't have a record of showing much mercy
the islamist militant group has been behind mass killings and kidnappings during its years long campaign to take over vast swaths of iraq and syria attempting to justify its actions like enslaving and having sex with young girls as somehow consistent with its extreme conservative faith
taking hostages from outside countries has been part of its playbook
not only has isis beheaded many of them but it's made a show of it by recording their deaths and showing them online as propaganda something that began in august with the killing of u.s. journalist james foley
those beheaded hostages were american and british both from countries involved in a military campaign against isis
japan is allies with both though it is not participating in any airstrikes or the training or <unk> of those fighting the militant group
tokyo's stance on the conflict including the two hundred million dollar pledge that abe made sunday was apparently enough to draw the ire of the group that calls itself the islamic state
although you are more than eight thousand five hundred kilometers away from the islamic state you willingly volunteered to take part in this crusade said the masked man who stood over goto and yukawa in tuesday's video addressing his comments to abe
abe has responded by defending the proposed aid and blasting isis threat against two of his nation's citizens as unacceptable
i feel angry about it he said tuesday
i strongly urge them to immediately release the hostages without harming them
cnn marketplace africa covers the macro trends impacting the region and also focuses on the continent's key industries and corporations
at least that's the intention behind the africa two moon mission which aims to muster enough money through internet donations to send a probe to the lunar surface within a decade
the project has been proposed by the foundation for space development south africa a non profit based in cape town that seeks to increase awareness around space education and research
by reaching for the stars the idea is to <unk> the youth of south africa and beyond and to boldly take the continent where its never gone before
we aim to inspire to educate and then once the mission has started up to do research and science the organization's chief executive jonathan weltman told cnn
the mission's website proudly states that the probe could even be programmed to beam pictures of the experiments it <unk> to classrooms all across africa
but how will these ambitious plans be turned into reality and how likely are they to succeed
weltman concedes that most people still regard an african nation going to the moon as a remote prospect
however <unk> two moon has the backing of a number of south african universities and the south african space association among others
funds have been rolling in via an online donation page over the last month and the target is to reach one hundred and fifty thousand dollar by the end of january to ensure the first stage goes ahead
as of publication the mission has raised twenty one thousand six hundred dollar
if <unk> this initial cash will be used to develop a full lunar program as well as undertake an associated feasibility study
outreach and public participation events to garner publicity and create engagement will also be arranged
beyond this stage suggestions from the scientific community around the world will be considered as to what experiments the probe should be designed to carry out
for example should it orbit the moon or should it take the shape of a vehicle that can land on the surface and take samples
our research must fit in with the rest of the world in terms of making a contribution of getting a better understanding of the moon and the needs that the global community has weltman said
while the ultimate goal is to follow the likes of the u.s. the <unk> india and china in getting up close to the lunar landscape it's the journey to that point that most interests weltman and the <unk> given their focus on education
studies have shown that countries like south africa lag behind those in europe and asia in terms of the number of higher education graduates and phd students they produce
according to an article penned by weltman on the africa two moon website meanwhile one in nine african graduates also leaves the continent after completing their studies
this has a damaging long term impact on the continent's development and economic prospects
but an eye catching mission to the moon could help reverse these trends weltman believes
the benefits won't only come in a decades time when the data starts to come through he said
if we can get somebody into science if we can get somebody to ask how are they going to get to the moon and somehow get them interested in any of the sciences and engineering that's our job done
a number of african nations have invested in space programs in recent years
south africa nigeria morocco tunisia algeria and egypt have all launched satellites to aid the likes of communications technology navigation technology agriculture disaster management and mining
the likes of ghana uganda angola ethiopia and kenya have also voiced their commitment to follow suit with space programs of their own
on top of this the square kilometer array project in south africa's karoo desert will be the largest and most powerful radio telescope on earth when it comes online
construction on ska which some have compared to <unk> large hadron collider is set to begin in two thousand and eighteen
in a december interview with cnn harvard university professor and co chair of the african union's high level panel on science technology and innovation calestous juma told cnn that such projects were vital to creating valuable and highly skilled <unk> on the continent
others however have asked whether space programs or complex science projects are where african countries should be placing their focus given the many other problems facing the continent
this is not a point of view weltman has much sympathy for
there's no denying there's poverty he said
there's ebola in western africa there's religious unrest there are a lot of trials and <unk> facing our continent and they do need to be dealt with
but if we pool everything into aid it's just a <unk> or a band aid that doesn't fix the problem
instead weltman suggests a more ambitious and joined up strategy that includes space ambitions will prove more fruitful in the long term
we have to have education
education leads to opportunity and opportunity will lead to economic empowerment he explained
beyond education you have to have skill retention
its no good creating an educated group who then migrate to better shores
then you lose that <unk> and you lose those future leaders because you're not providing for them
if we don't do that what chance do we ever have of standing shoulder to shoulder so that one day people saying africa goes to mars is as normal as saying america goes to mars he said
when the fifth most powerful woman in the world according to forbes takes to the stage journalists make sure their pens are poised
and in a time of economic austerity not to mention scandal allegations regarding the <unk> former managing director the media spotlight on lagarde is fierce
but away from the camera lens what personal events shaped the fifty nine year old financial leader we know today
here are five things you might not know about lagarde
clearly the death of my father when i was sixteen was a pivotal moment because you suddenly realize the hardship the pain lagarde told cnn's <unk> <unk>
it certainly provided me with a better understanding of how tough it can be for a single mother to raise kids
lagarde won a bronze medal in the french national championship when she was just fifteen years old
synchronized swimming might also have more in common with politics than you think
it was synchronized swimming that taught me
<unk> your teeth and smile lagarde told the guardian
it was when i applied to the biggest law firm in paris and i was told that i would be a great recruit and that i would be given good work to do but that i should never expect to make partnership because i was a woman lagarde told cnn
i thought to myself
you don't deserve me i'm going
and i had that sense of extraordinary freedom walking down the staircase and thinking to myself
what would i do in this firm
why would i work with that kind of attitude
for a while i felt sort of held back and i decided
no no no no no no you have to get over it lagarde told cnn
you need to try to take the <unk> from that failure and ask yourself
why did i fail
then you learn about it and you move on
it's perhaps fitting that the imf boss who oversees the world's finances was born on such a neat date
the eldest sister to three brothers lagarde was raised in normandy to an english professor father and latin teacher mother

even mitt romney mr. forty seven percents wants to lift people out of poverty
in a recent address at the republican national committee romney said the rich have gotten richer income inequality has gotten worse and there are more people in poverty than ever before under this president
twitter lit up
and i mean lit up
he wouldn't know poverty if it slapped him in the face
gawker dot com piled on
comedy has an element of <unk> at least he has that going for him
another
they actually let this guy win the nomination last time take a moment to <unk> what that really means about the right
seriously everyone jumped in including progressive darling sen. elizabeth warren d massachusetts who tweeted good to see mitt romney suddenly talking about working families
are corporations still people too mitt
it's easy to poke fun at a guy who has an elevator for his cars even if you think he's sincere in his sudden public compassion for the working poor
i actually think it's a good thing romney and other republicans are talking about the difficulties of the working poor
it's a lot better than poverty shaming
let's face it not many americans who find themselves in trouble want to jump up and shout i don't have any money
i need help
i'm sure there are more than a few who don't mind admitting they're poor or on food stamps or medicaid but i'm also sure the vast majority of americans would be ashamed to admit they're poor or even in present need
i experienced a little of that myself in grade school and then later on for a time in college
i clearly remember how ashamed i felt to qualify for the free lunch program
the other kids knew
sometimes i wouldn't eat so they wouldn't stare
so when in two thousand and twelve newt gingrich suggested children living in poverty work as <unk> to instill a work ethic it <unk> me the wrong way
my parents were not lazy
they had jobs we just fell out of the middle class for a time then with help figured it out and rose right back up
i'm not going to sit here and tell you i know what it's like to be <unk> poor i don't
i just remember how embarrassed i felt when people thought i was poor and my parents were lazy
funny thing is now that i'm richer than most americans i feel a <unk> embarrassed about that too
i still consider myself middle class and hard working caring and generous
is romney sincere in wanting to lift people out of poverty
is president obama just posturing as he proposes initiatives meant to help the working poor that he knows won't pass a republican congress
because these questions are <unk> we tend to focus on them
and we debate their answers endlessly often without ever coming to any conclusions
but i do think it's a victory that both sides now acknowledge that yes there is a yawning wage gap
yes there are too many hard working americans living in poverty
and yes we must somehow work together to elevate the poor and build a financially strong middle class
our entire modern world is constructed to keep you sitting down
when we drive we sit
when we work at an office we sit
when we watch tv well you get the picture
and yet a new study that's running in the annals of internal medicine found that this kind of sedentary behavior increases our chances of getting a disease or a condition that will kill us prematurely even if we exercise
how much sex is considered exercise
researchers from toronto came to this conclusion after analyzing forty seven studies of sedentary behavior
they adjusted their data to incorporate the amount someone exercises and found that the sitting we typically do in a day still <unk> the benefit we get from exercise
of course the more you exercise the lower the impact of sedentary behavior
the studies showed sedentary behavior can lead to death from cardiovascular issues and cancer as well as cause chronic conditions such as type two diabetes
physical inactivity has been identified as the fourth leading risk factor for death for people all around the world according to the world health organization
prolonged sitting meaning sitting for eight to twelve hours or more a day increased your risk of developing type two diabetes by ninety percents
eight sneaky things that may feed obesity
so what can you do to reduce the time you spend engaged in an activity that is not good for you
the study authors did make some simple suggestions to help you sit less
one is to just be aware of how much you are sitting
that way you can make a goal of reducing that number a little bit each week
if you are at work you could try a standing desk or make it a goal to stand up or walk around for a minute or three once every half an hour
if you watch tv at night don't zoom ahead during the commercials with your dvr
instead walk around or at least stand up during the show break

two is facing a whole new challenge getting to grips with the vacuum cleaner
persistent and worsening knee problems forced her to retire in september at the age of thirty two and she admits the transition from tennis star to domestic goddess has been challenging
i do the house cleaning
before when i was traveling i thought it was all pretty easy
and now i have to do all these things i think tennis is much easier she told cnn's open court
luckily for li she can count on the support of her husband dennis with whom she is expecting her first child this summer
family for me is most important thing she said two days before announcing her pregnancy on the opening day of the year's first grand slam
i'm starting to learn how to cook before i never had the time or the chance
now sometimes i say
hey dennis i always do the house cleaning you have to do some cooking
he's a little bit like
hey i'm the man why should i do this
li china's most successful tennis export became asia's first grand slam singles champion at the two thousand and eleven french open before adding another title with that victory in melbourne last year
but she says she'll be happy for all that to be forgotten if she can help <unk> through a new generation of chinese tennis stars
i will try to have a tennis academy to help more young children she explains
when i said i would retire and said i wanted a tennis academy everyone in china invited me
but i have to find the right one of course in a big city and to have communication with the government
from what she has seen so far lack of belief shouldn't be a problem when it comes to the nation's promising youngsters
i hear people say
oh my daughter is ten times better than li na she smiles
i like this confidence
at least they have a goal
and if she succeeds in her aim of encouraging fresh talent li who won a total of nine <unk> titles says she wants people's memories of her outstanding career to fade quietly away
honestly i would like the world to forget me she adds
because if they always remember me that will mean that chinese tennis hasn't grown up
i wish that a lot of young or new players will come up and people will say
oh this is a chinese player
but she admits leaving her own career behind was a very hard step to take describing the decision to quit as pretty sad
it was also inevitable
my knee couldn't handle it any more she adds
i think it was after wimbledon that i saw the knee was getting even worse
at the end of july i had to have my fourth operation
i tried to recover but didn't do very well
women's tennis now is pretty tough and everyone is much stronger
so if i couldn't stay healthy i couldn't play at the highest level
if you're a professional athlete you always want to win all of them matches
you never want to lose on court
after all those years on the tour she turned professional in one thousand nine hundred and ninety nine li is slowly getting used to the idea of spending more time at leisure and less <unk> from country to country
but she will never take her eyes off what is happening in the tennis world and is watching the continuing progress of japanese star kei nishikori with increasing interest
i think he's doing amazingly she adds
last year in the u.s. open he was pretty close to the trophy
she hopes the japanese star's success will also inspire the men's game in china
he's doing well but he's not so tall or so strong
people can think
he's not a western player and maybe men players in china can think we could do the same or even better
and as she <unk> down to watch her first australian open for years as a spectator rather than a participant who does li feel might take the title that her retirement has left her unable to defend
i think maybe wimbledon champion petra kvitova she says backing her best friend on the tour
i like the way she hits
but as if we really needed warning don't write off serena williams
if she wants to win she can win
whoever lifts the trophy it might inspire li knees <unk> of course to get back out on court and start hitting a few shots
there will be no glory this time though and no fans
all future games will be strictly for fun
after all as she says you can't totally leave something that has been so central to your world behind
tennis is my life she concludes
i grew up with tennis and everything i know is from tennis
he has all the things most people would ever desire
he never asks how much things cost
he shops for stuff the day before the sales start
i'm not joking
he did that in december
he has a collection of <unk> designer trainers made from exotic animal <unk> and with lots of shiny bits that cost from three hundred per pair upwards
he buys paintings in the royal <unk> summer exhibition
i don't mean the small affordable pieces
but pete doesn't feel rich
he's not satisfied at all
he was telling me recently about the time he'd dropped his son off at another <unk> <unk> hill home for a birthday party
so i went downstairs to the <unk> entrance he said and right there on the wall next to where the kids were hanging up their coats were two andy <unk>
this display of a twenty th century <unk> prints were proof that these people had made it
and just like that his collection of royal academy original paintings seemed <unk>
for a while i thought of this as the <unk> of the city but i've come to realize it's true for all of us
it's the story of our <unk> consumer society
just as the have <unk> aspire to catch up with the <unk> so the <unk> look up to the have <unk>
it doesn't matter who you are you still want to catch up with keep up with and get ahead of the <unk>
it's funny how people think of this idea as bad today
but keeping up is perfectly natural
all animals including humans like to establish their status in the social hierarchy
to let others know their place in the <unk> order birds of paradise show off their day glow tail feathers
lions shake their thick dark <unk>
<unk> monkeys <unk>
and in our <unk> consumer society the best way to keep up has traditionally been through the ritual display of the stuff we own like designer watches <unk> shoes and andy <unk> <unk>
this is both good and bad
good in that our <unk> system has leveraged this <unk> desire to keep up to create the most incredible increase in standards of living in human history
but also bad because in today's <unk> society having stuff signifies success and equally not having stuff says failure
as a result we are not only <unk> or painfully aware of who is above or below us but also that we can <unk> up or slip down the rankings at any moment
it is like living in an immense stomach churning session of snakes and <unk> where the game never stops and where everybody is a competitor
to play this paranoia inducing game and it is a game we all play millions of us spend too much time worrying about our place in the <unk> order and <unk> to get up the <unk> and avoid the snakes
the result is millions of us left wanting even though we have pretty much all we desire
there is a way to solve this to step out of the game a little if you like
it is very simple and it requires only one very small change in your behavior
spend ever less of your time and money on material goods and ever more on experiences instead
do this and you will be happier for all sorts of reasons
one of those is at the heart of the <unk> of the city
material goods are easier to compare than experiences which means you are more likely to be aware of their status value how far forward they take you on the social snakes and <unk> board or how far back they make you slide
and while experiences are comparable your holiday in mauritius versus my camping holiday in wales for instance it is a <unk> comparison and that takes our focus away from status
besides your holiday may have cost more and been more fabulous in all sorts of ways but did you have a better time
and is chilled champagne at an indian ocean beach bar better than a warm beer in a pub on the <unk> peninsula
so don't bother with trying to fulfill all your material desires
they will only leave you wanting
instead shift what you desire from things to experiences
you'll have a better more fun way to shake your tail feathers and you'll be happier

french company newwind has created the arbre a vent or wind tree a three meter tall generator designed for urban environments which makes the most of smaller air currents
operating in near complete silence the wind tree consists of seventy two micro turbine aeroleaves that rotate in the wind generating an estimated three point <unk> kw of power
while this isn't much compared to industrial sized turbines which typically generate in the region of one three mw having multiple smaller turbines has its uses
urban wind is not very strong but it is very turbulent says arbre vent engineer julia revuz
these turbines need less wind to get started and produce around three kw of energy which could heat a small home fuel lights or charge an electric car
newwind was founded by <unk> <unk> <unk> three years ago when he had the idea for the wind tree while taking a walk
he saw the leaves on a tree moving in the wind and started thinking about the possibility of turning that kinetic energy into electricity
the current prototype of the tree is steel and the energy made from it goes into the electricity grid and is used locally
we haven't yet <unk> the structure says revuz
we are hoping to make the leaves out of eco friendly materials and for the tree to have as a low a carbon footprint as possible
a twelve meter tall prototype of the tree will be on display from march twelve for two months at place de la concorde a major public square in paris
this prototype which weighs around five tons and costs roughly thirty five thousand dollar is to be used as an educational tool and will aim to show the public the technology behind the structure
the wind tree will be mass produced for sale from march two thousand and fifteen and newwind says it has raised one point one five million to begin pre production
the reaction has been very positive so far explains revuz
people don't know how it works but they like it they find it magical
there is a very negative view of wind energy people think it's ugly and it ruins their landscapes
then they see the wind tree and they think differently
newwind has had interest from local government in france and europe as well as real estate agents and businesses that want to have the tree on their land
there are even talks about another demonstration tree in london next year
the wind tree may not be affordable and practical for everyone but there are other applications that could be more accessible
our technology is in the mini wind turbines says revuz
so we are developing other applications for them
architects have been in touch and are interested in using them in their work perhaps on the roofs of buildings
mini turbines are cheaper to produce and buy than the wind tree
other ideas for the aeroleaves include rooftop foliage installed on buildings foliage on <unk> and the smart balcony where the mini turbines are attached to balcony <unk>
however innovative this is not the first urban energy source inspired by nature check out the power flower and others in the gallery above
yet we know what needs to be done for example to end the ebola disaster halt climate change rid our world of hunger and begin the difficult process of healing deep divisions in our societies
our failure is not because of a lack of knowledge or global resources but leadership and resolve by politicians but also throughout society
how we put this right must be at the heart of all discussions at davos this week
let's start with ebola
we have known about this disease for forty years how deadly it is how it is transmitted and how to prevent infection
yet we have lost thousands of lives already to the epidemic in west africa and only now have the resources from within countries and outside been mobilized to halt it
we need to learn the lessons and ensure we can move much more quickly and effectively before such deadly diseases take hold
the last few months have also underlined the need for big <unk> to invest more into the research of diseases that occur in poorer countries
the extraordinary progress in tackling some of the world's greatest killers through the development and distribution of vaccines shows what can be achieved through our collective efforts
second africa with the world's most <unk> <unk> land has the potential to help end the global food security and nutrition crisis
yet it fails to grow enough food even to feed its own people
africa's governments have <unk> their responsibility to put in place the policies and investments which will enable the continent's farmers big and small to provide the food needed
they must deliver the improved infrastructure which is vital to this ambition
business must respond as well particularly by giving small holder farmers the access to new crop varieties techniques and markets
the third area where leadership is absolutely crucial is the climate crisis
how is it possible that climate change conferences continually fail to provide the breakthrough given that the science is so clear about the threat to future generations and our planet
in december a global agreement must be reached in paris on the framework and policies needed to halt climate change
political leaders need to look beyond the next electoral cycle
civil society has largely already understood what needs to be done
i believe corporations will quickly respond to the challenge as many already have
there can be no clearer example of where our common values must be <unk>
there are welcome signs that this is at last beginning to be understood
<unk> we know that successful peace processes are our only chance of escaping the circle of violence
without the resolve to address the past openly and without leaders showing the courage to give peace commissions the independence they need solutions will be <unk>
it takes courage to address the rights of victims genuinely but it is fundamental to heal wounds permanently
in a world riddled with conflict this courage will be more essential than ever
the international community needs to do more to support countries through this often difficult process
finally there is also an urgent need to step up support for democracy and elections
while almost every country now votes public faith in democracy is on the <unk>
in too many countries political leaders manipulate the process to deny their citizens a proper voice
even in mature democracies there is an increasingly widespread belief that elections change little and that the political elite serve only their only narrow interests
leaders in two thousand and fifteen will once more have the choice between using elections to give their regimes a <unk> of democratic legitimacy or ensuring a level playing field respecting the secrecy of the ballot and above all accept the result peacefully
last year's successful presidential elections and peaceful hand over of power in indonesia the world's third largest democracy even when the result was very close provided real hope for the future
supporting the integrity of elections in africa and elsewhere will be an area like all these challenges i and my foundation sees as particular priorities this year
in times of uncertainty it is all too easy to surrender to fear and retreat look inward and think short term
but what is urgently needed is the ability in politics but also in business and society as a whole to look beyond national borders the next election or set of quarterly results
this must <unk> not just discussions at davos but all our actions as voters citizens and consumers in the coming months and years

the rebels have agreed to release the president's chief of staff and withdraw their militias from key government institutions if officials take a significant step
rewriting parts of the country's constitution according to a yemeni official with access to a draft text of the peace deal
under the terms of the agreement the government will accept changes in the draft of the new constitution that would grant the houthis more political power
word of the deal still leaves many questions unanswered
what could the reshaped constitution look like
how much power will the rebels get
and how much control will president abdu rabu mansour hadi have
houthi rebels shiite muslims who have long felt marginalized in the majority sunni country abducted the president's chief of staff over the weekend then took over the presidential palace in sanaa on tuesday
one government minister called it the completion of a coup but rebels said they had not asked the president to step down
the chaos in yemen is cause for concern far beyond the country's borders
for the united states and its allies yemen's government has been a key ally in the fight against al qaeda in the arabian peninsula the yemen based group linked to attacks such as the recent slaughter at french magazine charlie hebdo
aqap also tried to blow up a plane landing in detroit in two thousand and nine
isis is also recruiting in yemen to expand its ranks
and questions over who's in charge over the past few days have sparked concerns that a power vacuum could help terrorist groups get a stronger foothold
but the deal <unk> wednesday could signal a return to stability said mohammed albasha a spokesman for the yemeni embassy in washington
the situation is fluid
it's critical
the government was paralyzed
parts of the government dysfunctional but we did not reach the point of no return he told cnn's the situation room
things are difficult but there are things that are moving forward
several of the constitutional changes sought by the houthis would emphasize the characteristics of yemen as a federal state and push for more inclusion of diverse groups
the houthis call for marginalized political groups to have the right to partnerships in state institutions and fair representation according to the text of the tentative agreement
in return for these government concessions the rebels basically agree to withdraw their fighters from the capital
the rebels control or have <unk> several government installations
the presidential palace the presidential residence the prime minister's residence and a military installation where missiles are housed
under the agreement the houthis would withdraw from all of these sites
the rebels would cooperate with the government so that the president and state institutions can return to their duties and would urge all state employees to return to their jobs
a houthi official said the rebels will abide by the deal if the president follows a timeline specified in the negotiations
this deal draws the road map for the political process going forward with the participation of all factions in yemen
in the past <unk> were not respected who hope this time will be different a member of the houthi political council said
this isn't the first time the rebels and the government have hammered out an agreement
houthis swept into the capital last year sparking battles that left more than three hundred dead in a month
in september they signed a ceasefire deal with the government and houthis have since installed themselves in key positions in the government and financial institutions
like them or not albasha said the houthis aren't going anywhere and are part of the yemeni political structure
they are now a fact of life
they are now a dominant force in many of the northern provinces he said
we're going to have to <unk> and live with them
for days the answers to questions about who's in charge of the country have varied depending on who you ask
even as rebel <unk> stepped up their presence outside the presidential palace a yemeni official told cnn the president does not consider himself a captive
the official said the houthis were assisting hadi's security detail in their protection mission because part of the detail had run away yesterday because of the fighting
a senior leader of the houthi resistance movement abdullah <unk> gave a similar account
he told cnn that the president's personal security left him which forced us to gather hundreds of fighters from our security to ensure he is safe
<unk> the actual balance of power the official said the houthis demands were clear and nobody can hide that they are the dominant force but they still recognize government power
besides the confusion about who is at the helm in yemen the rebels seized military installations it says it will return under the agreement
two houthi field commanders told cnn that rebels had seized control of a massive weapons depot belonging to the government brigade that provides presidential personal security
the houthis had control of two hundred and eighty t eighty russian made tanks and other heavy artillery the field commanders said
while most of the security forces reportedly fled after a light clash with militants the houthis said they captured at least twelve special forces soldiers
on wednesday houthi rebels surrounded a yemeni missile brigade in <unk> a suburb east of sanaa
the installation is not under control of the rebels but they have it surrounded the field commanders and two government officials said
the houthis said their objective is not to take over the missile brigade but to keep missiles from being moved elsewhere

the black clad isis militant shown in a video demanding a two hundred million dollar ransom to spare the lives of two japanese citizens looks and sounds similar to the man who has appeared in at least five previous hostage videos
the knife wielding masked man with a london accent nicknamed jihadi john has issued threats and overseen the beheadings of american and british captives
you now have seventy two hours to pressure your government in making a wise decision by paying the two hundred million dollar to save the lives of your citizens the man in the video that appeared tuesday says in comments addressed to japanese citizens
otherwise this knife will become your nightmare
the amount of money is the same as that recently pledged by japanese prime minister shinzo abe in humanitarian aid to middle east countries that are affected by isis bloody campaign in iraq and syria
japan believes the deadline arrives friday at twelve fifty a.m
et
and chief cabinet minister yoshihide suga said wednesday the country will do its best to communicate with isis through a third party nation
but mystery and confusion still surround the identity of jihadi john
u.s. and british officials have said they believe they know who he is but they haven't disclosed the information publicly
that could be because western intelligence agencies believe they have more to gain from keeping quiet says <unk> <unk> a former cia officer
they can put pressure on his family put pressure on his friends he told cnn
maybe they have a line to him
maybe they know who his cousins are who are going to syria who can identify him
however if you publicly tell everybody who he is his real identity then maybe he'll go to ground and he'll disappear
there had been reports that jihadi john was injured in a bombing attack by the u.s. led anti isis coalition
but the video that appeared tuesday would suggest if it's really the same person that he's alive and well enough to make a death threat accompanied by a demand for money
his apparent <unk> helps isis slick propaganda machine which is used by the extremist group to raise money and recruit followers
it shows them resilient that they're able to film this video with these japanese hostages outside in broad daylight somewhere presumably in syria said cnn terrorism analyst paul cruickshank
five months and roughly two thousand airstrikes after isis video of the killing of u.s. journalist james foley why does one of the west's most prominent <unk> appear to still be at liberty
u.s. and british military and intelligence officials declined to comment on the matter
experts say the problem lies in the extreme difficulty of <unk> commandos into syria to reach jihadi john
isis operates in what we call denied territory said cedric leighton a retired u.s. air force colonel
and that means by definition that it's very hard for our folks to get in there it's very hard for them to actually lay eyes on target
a mission by u.s. special operations forces in july failed to find foley and other hostages in syria
the attempt to rescue mr. foley is one of the things that has now made the white house very reluctant to act aggressively said tony <unk> a former u.s. intelligence operative who directed special operations in iraq and afghanistan
a senior u.s. administration official however said the u.s. government is actively pursuing justice for the slayings of the hostages
the fbi has an open criminal investigation and as you have seen we will hold terrorists like this accountable no matter how long it takes the official said on condition of anonymity
for operational security reasons we are not in a position to detail all of the steps we are undertaking
meanwhile as isis deadline draws nearer the japanese government has to decide how it will respond to the extremists latest life or death ultimatum
the french government decided to award citizenship to the malian born twenty four year old supermarket employee after he risked his own life to hide customers from hostage taker amedy coulibaly earlier this month
four people lost their lives in the hostage taking and shooting at the kosher grocery store
but the fifteen people whom bathily led downstairs to hide in a walk in freezer stayed safe
bathily who describes himself as a practicing muslim told cnn affiliate bfmtv he switched off the freezer turned off the lights and told everyone to stay calm
he went upstairs following orders from the hostage taker but managed to run outside and tell police about the situation in the store
in his opening speech at the ceremony tuesday evening cazeneuve praised bathily's gesture of courage and humanity which had become the symbol of an islam of peace and tolerance
bathily who arrived in france when he was sixteen had dreamed of gaining french citizenship since his childhood
today this dream is becoming true a bit faster than expected cazeneuve said
valls also paid tribute to the courage of the young man
with you and with all the people in this room the prime minister said we just saw one of the most beautiful images of our country
valls also recalled the strong ties between france and mali a country which saw <unk> being <unk> by terrorists and which received french support in its fight against jihadism
the french military has been involved in fighting islamist extremists in mali and the wider <unk> region since early two thousand and thirteen
both valls and cazeneuve emphasized the importance of keeping french citizenship open in order to remain faithful to the republican ideal
welcoming new french citizens is an opportunity for the country as well as for those who become french valls said
bathily then took the floor
i thank you with all my heart for awarding me french citizenship
i am proud and moved the young man said
people think i am a hero but i am not
i am just lassana
at the end of the ceremony bathily received his passport together with a letter from president francois hollande and the citizenship kit distributed to all new french citizens
coulibaly the terrorist killed in the police operation that ended the supermarket attack also had roots in mali
but unlike bathily he was born in france and had french citizenship

no challenge poses a greater threat to future generations than climate change said obama in his state of the union speech tuesday
his statement was met with scattered muted applause
the united states should lead in international efforts to protect the one planet we've got he said
two thousand and fourteen was the warmest year since record keeping began

we were used to having u.s. as a <unk> said liz gallagher the program leader of climate diplomacy at e three g an environmental group
environmentalist noted a shift in recent years under obama including a recent agreement with china to reduce emissions
it's better to have america inside the game than outside
it makes it easier to persuade everyone else said gallagher
the u.s. remains the second greatest <unk> behind china
in a historic climate change deal in november obama and chinese president xi jinping announced that both countries would curb their greenhouse gas emissions over the next two decades
the two countries account for over one third of global greenhouse gas emissions
because the world's two largest economies came together other nations are now stepping up and offering hope that this year the world will finally reach an agreement to protect the one planet we've got obama said during his speech
a critical un climate change conference will be held in paris in december this year aimed at reaching a legally binding international climate agreement

maria sharapova survived a scare too while roger federer might have been <unk> by a bee on an eventful third day at the year's opening major
hampered by knee hamstring and back injuries in past losses in melbourne fourteen time grand slam winner nadal felt dizzy and was close to exiting in the second round against american qualifier tim smyczek
but nadal showed his <unk> heart to rally past his one hundred and twelve th ranked foe six two three six six seven six three seven five in more than four hours
when the night match was over nadal sunk to the court reminiscent of a celebration for someone who has just won a grand slam final
in an on court interview he said cramps were the source of his troubles
recent inactivity didn't help either
nadal hasn't played much tennis the past six months
i felt very tired after the first set nadal told the crowd
i don't know what's going on he added
i felt this <unk> after the first set
i started to have some cramps around the body different places so that says i was not in the perfect shape because it's not normal after one hour to start to have these types of things
but it's normal after a tough period of time without having the chance to be on the tour
the last time nadal played under the lights on rod laver arena it was indeed in a grand slam final
he hurt his back twelve months ago and lost to stan wawrinka in four sets
there didn't appear to be anything <unk> with nadal after he won the first set in routine fashion against smyczek on wednesday but things took a turn for the worse for him in the middle of the second
recovering a break for one two in the third nadal called for the doctor and was given medication
nadal's shots lacking depth from the baseline and with no punch on his serve smyczek grew in confidence
still when nadal broke and held for five three order seemed to be restored
smyczek though broke back and swept to the tiebreak seven two with some flashy tennis
early in the fourth a <unk> over nadal was spent physically but somehow he broke and closed out the set
holding a sixteen five record in fifth sets the numbers favored nadal in the <unk>
despite missing three break points earlier in the set nadal <unk> in the eleven th game and eventually <unk>
but smyczek walked off court to huge applause
if his winners weren't enough he allowed nadal to replay a serve in the last game when a fan shouted out
nadal took note
not a lot of people would do something like this at six five after four hours so just congratulate him for that and because he played a great match said nadal
it was the second round of the australian open so sharapova should have known there would be some drama
a year after the russian saw off <unk> <unk> ten eight in the third set in <unk> conditions in melbourne she was even closer to exiting wednesday
sharapova needed to save two match points before finally overcoming compatriot alexandra panova six one four six seven five in similarly <unk> though it wasn't as warm as last year daytime conditions
sharapova struck forty three unforced errors in the final two sets but crucially for the five time grand slam champion she produced <unk> winners on the match points with panova serving at five four in the third
that game was a missed opportunity for the one hundred and fifty th ranked qualifier and panova also led by two breaks in the third at four one
sharapova who is attempting to win a first major in seven years outside roland garros was left both relieved and annoyed
i didn't feel that i was positive enough even though i was making a few more errors than i would have liked she told reporters
and i wasn't making enough first serves
but i was thinking about it too much instead of just like being in the present saying hey go up to the line do what you do do what you've done thousands of times
i'm good at that and i'll continue to be good at that
but some days are just a little off
today was one of them
<unk> performance might not <unk> well for the rest of the tournament but at the same time it might simply be a <unk>
last year at the australian open li na survived a match point in the third round against <unk> <unk> and then went on to win her second grand slam title
you never know how you're going to feel until you go out on the court and compete and play sharapova said
no matter how you prepare what you did once you get out there everything starts from scratch
it was a tough day but i pulled through
i guess at this point that's what matters
certainly gives me a lot of confidence that i didn't play my best tennis and was able to come through
federer lost a set and was visited by the trainer too although he wasn't troubled nearly as much as sharapova and nadal
he called for the trainer after losing the first set due to an issue with his hand yet wasn't sure what the problem was
i don't know what it was federer said
i still don't know
i just wanted to have a chat with the <unk> just see what we can do
i know there is nothing we could do
i knew we couldn't tape it up because then it would be even bigger and more weird
i just said i hope it doesn't get worse or stay like this
actually it went away but now i feel it again
the record seventeen time grand slam winner recovered and eventually eased past italian <unk> <unk> three six six three six two six two
federer only faced one break point and hit fifteen <unk>
the swiss potential quarterfinal foe is andy murray and the scot made quick work of <unk> <unk> <unk> six one six three six two
viktor <unk> meanwhile extended his winning streak to ten matches by defeating argentina's leonardo mayer six four four six six four six zero
the <unk> ranking fell outside the top eight hundred in july following a contentious drug suspension but <unk> now finds himself in the top sixty after winning a title in sydney last week
the ranking will climb further with his wins in melbourne
i'm enjoying playing tennis and having fun on the court <unk> a former top twenty player said
i missed it a lot and that gives me a lot of joy on the court and a lot of motivation
trying to use any chance any match any tournament
it's going well
you wouldn't know it from the twitter traffic during the state of the union
the folks at the <unk> site said more than two point six million tweets were sent around the world with the hashtag sotu
it was a case of come for the speech stay for the spectacle
sure the president made a <unk> pitch for economic <unk> and issued a historic call for transgender protection
but sotu was a feast for the eyes as well
here are our eleven favorite social media moments from tuesday night
first lady michelle obama pulled a major fashion no no by <unk> the same dress as <unk> <unk> character <unk> <unk> on the good wife

an investigating team said the stampede happened at eleven thirty five p.m. local time when huge crowds trying to reach the iconic riverfront <unk> known as the bund clashed with others attempting to leave on a staircase
most of the victims were in their twenty s with the youngest being only twelve years old
of the injured three remained in a serious condition in hospital as of wednesday

i failed to protect you details emerge from stampede
investigators blamed various government agencies of the city's huangpu district whose jurisdiction includes the bund for the fatal incident
they said local officials were ill prepared for the crowds and <unk> the aftermath
although the district authorities had earlier called off a popular riverfront light show on new year's eve thousands of <unk> unaware of the cancellation due to the lack of official updates still flocked to the bund investigators said
they singled out the district police department for severely <unk> the crowd size which had reached three hundred and ten thousand people by midnight and <unk> fewer than six hundred officers and other security personnel to the area
three top district officials in huangpu have been sacked the local communist party boss his deputy and the district police chief and a total of eleven officials face punishment for their role in the incident
in a nod to public criticism the ruling communist party's disciplinary arm in shanghai also confirmed on wednesday that several huangpu district officials including the fired communist boss and his deputy violated party regulations by <unk> and dining for free at a high end japanese restaurant on the bund shortly before the stampede
after chinese president xi jinping warned officials about public safety following the stampede authorities across the country have rushed to cancel large gatherings ranging from pop concerts to shopping festivals

in france and especially in paris the mood over the past two weeks has been subdued but <unk> by public displays of solidarity across faiths
in a famously <unk> society there is a sense of <unk>
the french seemed to have <unk> in reaching back into their history and the <unk>
they have started reading voltaire
one of france's most renowned <unk> voltaire published his treatise on tolerance in one thousand seven hundred and sixty three
it was an appeal for religious tolerance within and between faiths
the french publisher <unk> says sales of the treatise have increased significantly since the charlie hebdo attacks
between two thousand and three and the beginning of this year <unk> had sold one hundred and twenty thousand copies of the book roughly ten thousand a year
from january twelve to fourteen immediately after the rally in paris in support of free speech and tolerance some seven thousand copies were sold
<unk> said another twenty thousand new copies would be made available to cope with demand
online orders on amazon and kindle have also spiked
when first published the treatise was a revolutionary creed and one that landed voltaire in trouble with the french government and especially powerful religious interests such as the <unk>
his message has endured to become a cornerstone of the french republic where the state and religion are formally and forcefully separated
but voltaire went far beyond the <unk> within christianity in the treatise
i say that we should regard all men as our brothers he wrote
what
the <unk> my brother
the <unk> my brother
the jew
the siam
yes without doubt
are we not all children of the same father and creatures of the same god
voltaire wrote the treatise because he was outraged by the execution of a protestant man jean <unk> who was <unk> convicted of murdering his own son to prevent him from converting to catholicism
his campaign to clear jean <unk> went all the way to king louis <unk> who pardoned <unk> <unk>
last week the justice minister here socialist christiane <unk> celebrated <unk> legacy when speaking at the memorial for the charlie hebdo cartoonist tignous
we can draw anything including a prophet because in france the france of voltaire and <unk> we have the right to make fun of religions she said
a right
yes because a right is democracy and democracy is the realm of the law
that sentiment was shared across the political spectrum
writing in le figaro on tuesday former prime minister <unk> <unk> said that faced with the drama that struck it france has shown great dignity
<unk> from the conservative <unk> wrote that the people have chosen by instinct loyalty to france
it was fitting and perhaps not accidental that when world leaders gathered at the rally last week to commemorate those killed in paris they began their walk down the boulevard voltaire toward the place de la nation
scattered around them among the many tributes posters of the writer <unk> with the motto
je suis charlie
some of the marchers waved copies of a treatise on tolerance as they walked and left them at impromptu memorials in the place de la <unk>
the <unk> at <unk> once the residence of royalty devoted the hall of the pope to a portrait of voltaire in honor of the victims of the terror attack
underneath a sign quotes from the treatise
what is tolerance
it is the <unk> of humanity
the <unk> voltaire charged with keeping the <unk> flame alive says the attacks in paris were also an attempt to assassinate him
in an article in l'express the <unk> said <unk> lifelong struggle was to crush the infamous and defend the victims of fanaticism
in the words of the <unk> alain <unk>
the border today is not between the religious and the atheist between the christian and non christian muslim and non muslim between the jewish and non jewish
it is between <unk> and civilization
among the millions of tweets in the wake of the charlie hebdo killings not a few cited these words attributed to voltaire
i do not agree with what you have to say but i'll defend to the death your right to say it
voltaire never actually said that
the phrase was invented by his english <unk> many years later
but he did write this in a treatise on tolerance
the fewer <unk> the fewer disputes
the fewer disputes the fewer <unk>
if this is not true then i'm wrong
two hundred fifty years later the words have new resonance

she was stabbed in the head
go to <unk> street the caller shouted
a man stabbed nine people including the driver of a bus and passengers on wednesday in what police are calling a terror attack
the girl was she conscious
the nine hundred and eleven operator asked
yes yes she is crying she is conscious the caller answered
the attacker was a twenty three year old palestinian from the west bank city of tulkarem authorities said
police shot him in the leg after he got off the bus
he was arrested and is being questioned they said
the suspect was identified as hamzeh <unk> said israeli authorities and the suspect's family
his uncle ahmad <unk> said his nephew lives with his mother in the west bank city of ramallah
the suspect's father lives in another west bank city tulkarem where the uncle was interviewed by cnn
hamzeh has no political affiliation the uncle said
we were called by the israeli military to come in for questioning
his father mother and myself we went and they were asking us about his political affiliation
we said that hamzeh never had any political affiliation
when asked what could be a motive for the suspect's attack the uncle said it was because of what he sees of suffering of the palestinians by israel
the daily attacks by the extremist jews and israelis on the <unk> mosque and especially this summer the killing of more than two thousand one hundred palestinians by israel in gaza
the suspect works as an <unk> supporting his mother and his younger brothers the uncle said
he came to see his father last night and his friends last night and he was in his nature nothing suspicious the uncle said
the uncle said his nephew born in late one thousand nine hundred and ninety two was age twenty two not twenty three as authorities reported
israeli authorities couldn't be immediately reached for comment to clarify the suspect's age but a government website stated the suspect was born in one thousand nine hundred and ninety two was originally from tulkarem and had no prior arrests
witnesses and police say that when the attacker boarded the bus and stabbed the driver and a few passengers the driver tried to fight back by spraying the assailant with pepper spray veering the bus pumping the brakes and opening the doors
some passengers were able to get out and get away
the attacker ran after them and stabbed a few people on his way out of the bus
prison guards who were in their car behind the bus got out of their vehicle and chased the assailant witnesses and police said
the attacker was shot in the leg and apprehended
four victims were seriously wounded according to emergency responders
five people were either lightly or moderately injured emergency services said
several other passengers were treated for shock
one person was severely injured officials told cnn and the attacker remains in moderate condition at a tel aviv hospital
the terror of the victims and the chaos during the attack was captured in other nine hundred and eleven calls
an injured woman can be heard telling an operator my body is covered with blood
in a separate call another woman says i have here a wounded man who is heavily bleeding someone has to come for help he is bleeding from the head from his neck that is what i see
the operator tells her to find a clean piece of cloth and press it against the man's wounds
a hamas spokesman <unk> al <unk> who is based in qatar praised the attack according to the times of israel and haaretz
the heroic stabbing incident against the zionist in tel aviv is a daring and heroic act he reportedly said
it comes as a natural response to the terrorist occupation crimes against our people
israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu fired back casting a net of blame around hamas and the palestinian authority which together form a unity government
the terrorist attack in tel aviv is the direct result of the poisonous incitement being disseminated by the palestinian authority against the jews and their state
this same terrorism is trying to attack us in paris brussels and everywhere
the u.s. embassy in israel on its website said that due to security concerns on israel's northern border all u.s. government personnel must get advance approval to travel within one point five miles of the lebanese border or east of route ninety eight in the golan heights

there has been a string of attacks against israeli residents in recent months
here is a look at a few of them
a palestinian man threw acid on an israeli family near a jerusalem checkpoint in december israeli authorities said
a teenage palestinian girl with a knife stabbed an israeli man in the west bank israeli police said
two palestinian cousins stormed a jerusalem synagogue in mid november with a gun and <unk> knives killing five
they were shot dead by police
days later israeli authorities said they foiled a plot by palestinians to assassinate israeli foreign minister <unk> lieberman
more than a week earlier attackers stabbed one israeli soldier to death in tel aviv and three more israelis near a west bank settlement the idf said
one of the west bank victims also died
in early november a palestinian man driving a van plowed into pedestrians at a train stop in eastern jerusalem killing two
another twelve people were injured
the man died in police gunfire after also attacking people with a metal bar police said
in october a palestinian man rammed his car into commuters waiting at a light rail stop in jerusalem killing a baby and wounding several other people israeli police said
the driver of the vehicle was shot as he tried to flee and later died
also in october according to a palestinian state news report an israeli man killed a five year old palestinian girl when he ran her down in a car as she walked home from kindergarten
the attack reportedly also injured a second five year old girl
in his state of the union address tuesday night more a lofty campaign style rallying call than a traditional <unk> policy lecture obama declared he had delivered on what voters first elected him to do
conquering a vicious economic crisis and ending ground wars in the middle east
tonight we turn the page the president said in his address to a joint session of congress trying to make an emphatic break with a turbulent fifteen year period when twin <unk> from terrorism and financial <unk> rocked the nation
the shadow of crisis has passed he said
the state of the union is strong
for the first time in a state of the union address it sounded like he meant it
the loose and combative obama who americans saw on tuesday night was not the <unk> crisis stifled president who last year seemed weary of his job and failed to mount an effective defense of democrats as the party lost the senate in november
there was no sign of <unk> or even an indication he felt at all bloodied by the disastrous mid terms in which democrats lost control of the senate
instead riding a tide of unexpected momentum which has even surprised white house aides obama shoved back in the game by wielding executive powers on issues like cuba and immigration to prove he is still a political force in washington
i have no more campaigns to run he said drawing republican applause before silencing his foes with a <unk> that <unk> his attitude to an opposition party with which he has <unk> for his entire presidency
i know because i won them both
he said the verdict is clear that his brand of middle class economics works and promised to wield his veto against any gop attempt to roll back reforms on health care and the financial industry
in exactly two years obama will be out of the white house
but he could not resist offering a <unk> for a democrat who wants to succeed him presumably hillary clinton pushing new <unk> of middle class economics and smarter middle east policy which would keep isis at bay and spare american soldiers from foreign <unk>
obama's claim of a new era of prosperity at home and security abroad angered republicans
mitt romney an old obama foe mulling another shot at the white house accused the president of a lack of leadership
more intent on winning elections than on winning progress he ignores the fact that the country has elected a congress that favors smaller government and lower taxes romney said on facebook
with fear of homegrown jihadists stalking the west from paris to ottawa and australia to belgium obama critics say he was in denial over a failing strategy to take on global terrorism
obama did not mention al qaeda at all
and he only referred to the attacks on the french satirical magazine charlie hebdo in passing
we stand united with people around the world who have been targeted by terrorists from a school in pakistan to the streets of paris obama said but gave no indication that the sudden <unk> of home grown jihadism would change his national security strategy
instead of sending large ground forces overseas we're partnering with nations from south asia to north africa to deny safe haven to terrorists who threaten america he said
potential gop presidential candidate sen. marco rubio warned that saying wars are over isn't enough to keep us safe
and even as he declared one era of foreign wars over the president asked congress to give him backing to wage another albeit the arms length clash using mainly air power against isis
obama's aides said the president saw his address not as a chance to unveil the usual laundry list of programs but to tell a new story about a presidency which has unfolded in times of crisis at home and abroad
his appearance six years on from the cold january day in two thousand and nine when he took the oath of office coincided with a cluster of political turning points
for the first time in a state of the union address tuesday obama the most liberal president since lyndon johnson stood up in the house of representatives and stared out at the members of two chambers which are now both controlled by republicans
it was a reminder that despite two crushing presidential victories obama's two terms also included two bitter mid term <unk> from voters
but with unemployment down to five point six percent with the economy churning out several hundred thousand jobs a month and with growth accelerating obama may have reached a political milestone
for years the president has got little credit for restoring an economy that was shedding seven hundred thousand jobs a month when he took office
that's partly because the results of the rebound have been so uneven
while the stock market has soared many in the middle class have been left behind
wages are stagnant and many of the new jobs created pay less and have fewer benefits than the ones that are gone
still there is a sense now that the benefits of the recovery are spreading and low gas prices are restoring a half forgotten sense of well being for many americans
with a growing economy shrinking deficits bustling industry and booming energy production we have risen from recession freer to write our own future than any other nation on earth obama said
it's now up to us to choose who we want to be over the next fifteen years and for decades to come
a wall street journal nbc news poll released tuesday showed that forty five percent of americans were now very or somewhat satisfied with the us economy and the trend is rising
the percentage of those who believe america is in decline has dropped to its lowest level since the crisis
the country now seems fifty fifty split on that issue
this is a president who for whatever reason woke up and saw the economic numbers and saw he had a pretty strong hand and he is going to start playing some cards right now said john <unk> a professor who specializes in the presidency at vanderbilt university
obama's own political fortunes are rising as a result
a washington post poll has him at fifty percent his highest rating for nearly two years
other surveys confirm the rebound but place obama in the high forty s still <unk> territory for a president <unk> in the mid term elections
the sense that obama is confronting an important political moment also played out as he addressed foreign policy
after years of telling americans that the tide of war is <unk> obama is being forced to confront an alarming new manifestation of violent jihadism in europe which many officials fear could soon make its way to the streets of the united states
american warplanes are in the skies over iraq again following the sudden rise of isis
up to three thousand troops have been sent back to the country just years after obama told americans the war was over
splintering states in the middle east including syria and yemen are offering new safe havens for terror groups with the united states in their sights
obama made the case for a focused but smarter campaign against isis but took time to <unk> criticisms by republicans like john mccain and lindsey graham who believe he is too slow to use force abroad
when we make rash decisions reacting to the headlines instead of using our heads when the first response to a challenge is to send in our military then we risk getting drawn into unnecessary conflicts obama said
the speech also marked a moment of <unk>
barring some great national political crisis tuesday's appearance may have been the last time when obama took the stage as america's most important voice for liberalism
when clinton announces what is seen as her almost certain presidential campaign later this year she will likely become the go to voice for progressives on all domestic issues
and by the time of the state of the union address next year the presidential primary season will be in full swing drawing media attention from the lame duck in the white house
robert <unk> chief <unk> for former vice president al gore said that obama had long term political goals in mind as he knew almost nothing he proposed would get passed
but he is laying the groundwork for whoever it is in two thousand and sixteen to run against a republican said <unk> now a professor at american university
apparently sensing his time is short obama mounted an extraordinary defense of his own political skills even referring to the speech in boston he made as an unknown senatorial candidate at the democratic national convention in two thousand and four
over the past six years the pundits have pointed out more than once that my presidency hasn't delivered on this vision obama said arguing that many people thought he was naive
i know how tempting such cynicism may be
but i still think the <unk> are wrong obama said in a plea for a better politics that will likely remain unfulfilled in one of the biggest disappointments of his presidency
ivory coast came into their opening game of the africa cup of nations as many people's tip for the title but began the tournament in a fashion suggesting that expectation was again not sitting easily with them
the contest against guinea whose players have spoken of their determination to do well for a country devastated by the ebola virus showed the familiar <unk> that have hindered an ivory coast team boasting star names such as <unk> toure wilfried bony and <unk>
a lack of <unk> was apparent in both defense and attack and a guinea team that scored six goals in their final two qualifying matches played in morocco because of the crisis took advantage in style
mohamed <unk> <unk> in a stunning volley to open the scoring after thirty six minutes of a first half in which the vast bulk of the energetic football came from the <unk>
just before the hour mark a bad situation for the <unk> seemed likely to become worse when <unk> who had shown more purpose than most of his teammates before the break was sent off for needlessly lashing out at <unk> <unk>

he showed that he was <unk> to make bold changes when he brought off toure with five minutes remaining with the manchester city star looking decidedly <unk> as he made way for <unk> <unk>

the spot poll only represents the views of people who watched the speech which may <unk> more democratic than the u.s. population as a whole
the sample of speech watchers in this poll were thirty nine percents democratic and twenty percents republican
our best estimate of the number of democrats in the voting age population as a whole indicates that the sample is about ten twelve points more democratic than the general public
obama's predecessor george w. bush saw positive reactions to his state of the union addresses decline between his six th and seven th year
strongly positive responses to bush's speech dropped from forty eight percents in two thousand and six to forty one percents in two thousand and seven
nearly three quarters of those who watched the speech seventy two percents said they thought obama's policy proposals would move the country in the right direction about on par with the sixty nine percents who felt his policies would move things in the right way after last year's speech
speech watchers were most positive that obama's education proposals were a step in the right direction though a smaller majority sixty percents thought he was moving the right way on immigration
among the four hundred and twenty speech watchers surveyed majorities felt that obama's proposals to help low income and middle class americans would be effective with the share saying they would be very effective rising when compared with the reaction to last year's speech
state of the union viewers tend to be friendly toward the president delivering the speech but this group also wants to see compromise
about three quarters seventy four percent say they think obama should attempt to reach a bipartisan compromise with congress on major issues up from sixty seven percents saying so last year

julie <unk> an operations manager for the group international bird rescue was <unk> by the mystery and the scope of the problem
i have been working here for ten years and i have never seen anything like this she said
the prognosis for birds in care is good and those that have been cleaned and rescued can be returned to the wild according to barbara <unk> a spokeswoman for international bird rescue
the birds tend to come into care needing hydration and medical <unk> and we have a mandatory twenty four hour <unk> process before cleaning she said
cleaning the animals involves using <unk> soda and <unk> to loosen the <unk> followed by dish detergent and hot water to wash away the foreign substance
and that's apparently enough for people to pledge a <unk> dollars
matthew inman the cartoonist and grammar enthusiast behind the popular comic website the oatmeal launched a fund raising campaign on kickstarter tuesday for a new card game that got more than seven hundred thousand dollar in pledges in just the first few hours
by wednesday exploding kittens raised over two million dollar
the game is a cross between <unk> signature <unk> comic drawings and the popular card game <unk>
it was dreamed up by inman and game creators elan lee and shane small according to the exploding kittens kickstarter page
the initial goal was ten thousand dollar
although there are a lot of reasons why the internet loves kittens one hint to exploding kittens fiery success is the oatmeal's cult following
its facebook page alone has more than three million followers
the game rules are explained in a short animated video on the kickstarter page
each player draws a card from the deck until someone draws an exploding kitten card
once an exploding kitten card is drawn the player is <unk> from the game
the more cards that are drawn from the deck the higher a player's chances of pulling an exploding kitten card
the game also adds a bit of humorous complexity featuring cards that enable players powers such as <unk> back hair and laser pointers to <unk> a <unk> <unk>
exploding kittens might seem too <unk> absurd to be true but with the success of other kickstarter campaigns such as party game favorite cards against humanity this project might be another crowd funded home run
cnn reached out to inman and his creative team for a comment but no one was available to talk
sorry all <unk> are so flooded right now lee wrote
the game creators did note on their fund raising page that they are staunchly against the harming of actual kittens
on the oatmeal's facebook page inman wrote that the kickstarter goal was reached in eight minutes
i love you my precious <unk>

that seems to be the underlying message of a twenty nine second video posted online this week by british journalist owen thomas <unk> the condition of the first class cabin on a british airways flight
anticipating a luxurious experience on a flight from london to saint <unk> on january seventeen thomas instead found a first class cabin he describes in the video as absolutely <unk> and disgusting
in the video thomas a bloomberg tv anchor who has previously worked for cnn international and the bbc points out stained surfaces then lifts his seat cushion to reveal dirt and dust collected underneath
it's when you open your seat that the real horror begins thomas says in dramatic fashion <unk> the video as he shoots it
this is british airways first class
it's disgusting
the video shows only thomas seating area and no other parts of the cabin
after the video went viral a ba spokesperson told london's telegraph
we are very sorry that on this occasion we have fallen short of our usual high standards
we pride ourselves on delivering a relaxing and pleasant experience in first class and are taking immediate action to address this issue

but many congressional republicans said with the speech the president closed the book on them entirely
house speaker john boehner echoed many of his republican colleagues with a statement that decried the address as more of the same from a president that's never been interested in working with the opposing party
the state of the union is a chance to start <unk> but all the president offered tonight is more taxes more government and more of the same approach that has failed middle class families he said in a statement
these aren't just the wrong policies they're the wrong priorities
growing washington's bureaucracy instead of america's economy
the address did lay out a laundry list of progressive priorities tax credits for middle class families paid for by raising taxes on wealthy americans
hikes in the minimum wage and protections for gay americans
free community college most of which had been <unk> over the past week and pre <unk> panned by republicans
senate finance committee chairman orrin hatch r utah accused obama of waging class warfare with the policies in tuesday morning remarks
but obama capped the speech off with a call for unity and for washington to transcend partisan politics that was reminiscent of his campaign stump speeches in the early months of the two thousand and eight race
republicans however said they weren't fooled
mcconnell headed straight for the exits after obama stepped down from the podium and in a release knocked obama for giving a speech that made it look like he's going to run for office again
texas sen. john cornyn said while obama called for unity his actions contradict what he said
i thought the tone was better suited for his first state of the union not his seventh cornyn said in the hallways of the capitol
i mean he's got six years of a track record he has to <unk> with the rhetoric
you have to suspend your disbelief based on the facts to believe everything he said
indeed the white house issued two veto threats to republican bills before his speech tuesday night and during the speech the president took multiple <unk> at republicans
even some democrats acknowledged obama may have gone too far
sen. joe manchin a blue dog democrat from west virginia who often breaks with the president told cnn he felt obama <unk> been more conciliatory
at first he started reaching out to republicans but then he hit them pretty hard
it got pretty partisan about sixty percents of the way through manchin said
i thought he could have kept from saying that
i just think we need to be more conciliatory
but it was that liberated charisma and the stark contrast with the gop that the president drew that had congressional democrats <unk> and buoyant
senate minority leader harry reid lauded obama for offering a clear contrast with republicans going forward
president obama laid out a clear vision for strengthening america's middle class that draws a clear contrast with the republican congress partisan political agenda of special interest <unk> and tax breaks for the wealthiest americans he said
some republicans did however express hopes for cooperation particularly on his push for a new trade deal
house majority whip steve scalise said while on obama's tax proposals we're going to have disagreements there is opportunity on trade
there's a real area where we're going to have agreement to increase trade promotion authority and that's something that can help our economy grow he told cnn
but that's one area where obama's likely to face rare opposition from his own party
liberal democrats in the house are opposed to a deal they believe will just drive jobs overseas
rep. louise slaughter d <unk> said she thought the speech was great except for the trade part i just can't buy that
slaughter dismissed the push for a new trade deal and the argument it will boost the middle class telling cnn there's not a thing they can tell me that would convince her to support new legislation on trade promotion authority
it was clear from obama's speech however that he won't shy away from moving unilaterally if needed where he can regardless of the response from the right or left
still it's an approach that has republicans decrying the obama they say they've always known unwilling to work with them to even broker compromises where they might find agreement
he is so detached and <unk> in the legislative process he just speaks as if he's on <unk>
<unk> saying if you send this to me i will veto it cornyn lamented
it's not the recipe for getting anything done
president barack obama focused on the economic gains that he hopes will become his presidential legacy during his state of the union address on tuesday and he decided to have a little fun too just another sign of a fourth quarter presidency
i have no more campaigns to run obama said drawing loud applause from republicans in the chamber
but obama had a quick comeback
i know cause i won both of em he said going off script and drawing applause from democrats
the president also <unk> from his script earlier on as he touted gains in the economy
this is good news people obama said followed by a rare presidential <unk>
obama also made the first presidential appeal for an instagram during his speech appealing to astronaut scott kelly to instagram his upcoming yearlong stay aboard the international space station
that remark though was included in the president's prepared speech
mitt romney took to facebook to argue that obama was dismissing the message that voters sent to washington when they voted for a republican majority in november
he ignores the fact that the country has elected a congress that favors smaller government and lower taxes the two thousand and twelve republican presidential nominee wrote
his tax proposal is a maze of new taxes and <unk>
in his speech obama called for closing loopholes in the tax code that he says leads to inequality by allowing the top one percents to avoid paying taxes on their accumulated wealth
the president is proposing a total of two hundred and thirty five billion dollar in tax credits that are aimed to help the middle class
to pay for it obama wants tax investment income capital gains and dividends at a higher rate which could help bring in three hundred and twenty billion dollar
as expected republicans widely panned the idea
former florida gov
jeb bush acknowledged that some have benefited in the economic recovery but far too many people have been left behind
it's unfortunate president obama wants to use the tax code to divide us instead of proposing reforms to create economic opportunity for every american he said on facebook
we can do better
sen. rand paul in his own taped response said the president is <unk> the pie but not growing it
our american revival is not going to be led by a lame duck president who would rather pick fights with congress he said in a statement
it will be led by <unk> who know how to get things done
sen. marco rubio said in a statement that obama's speech doubles down on outdated proposals to tax and spend more
he also ripped into the president over his recent cuba policy saying it rewards repressive anti american regimes
joining hambycast by phone rubio later tweaked obama's pitch to make community college free
the single greatest impediment to community colleges today are not <unk> the fact that at the end of that community college tunnel is that graduates don't see jobs he told cnn's peter hamby
separately rubio told cnn's <unk> walsh that he felt republicans could work with obama on some things like increasing the child tax credit
i do think we have to focus on child care costs in america he said
they are very high for working families
sen. ted cruz in a statement criticizing obama's speech said america saw a powerful demonstration that it is time to move on beyond president barack obama
the texas republican posted a taped response earlier in the night on his youtube page but it was taken down
reporters noted that cruz appeared to mess up in the video and asked to start over
many of the republicans were quick to sing the praises of iowa sen. joni ernst who gave the republican response showing that it's never a bad move to praise the new senator from the state that holds the nation's first nominating contest
bush said his friend joni offered a great contrast while paul tweeted that his friend did a great job tonight
former sen. rick santorum who's spending five days in iowa next week also tweeted a shout out
good job <unk>
well delivered which drew a clear contrast
clinton for her part backed the president on twitter saying obama pointed a way to an economy that works for all
now we need to step up and deliver for the middle class
the former secretary of state is considered the democratic frontrunner if she runs for president
sen. elizabeth warren of massachusetts said in a statement that obama got it right and laid out ways we can create more opportunities for working families
outgoing maryland gov
martin o'malley praised obama's policies saying in a statement the worst thing we could do is let recent economic progress be undercut by republican efforts to undo critically important financial reforms
some of the potential republican contenders also criticized obama's speech in real time
paul for example <unk> obama's push for free community college with multiple tweets
paul's facebook account also set up a fact check game where players could guess whether statements in obama's previous addresses were true or not so fast
santorum said a line that he agreed with was the idea that we want people to not only share in america's success but contribute to its success
on the democratic side former sen. jim webb who's announced a presidential exploratory committee live tweeted his thoughts during the speech
as americans we respect human dignity even when we're threatened which is why i've prohibited torture and worked to make sure our use of new technology like drones is properly constrained obama said
that's why we defend free speech and advocate for political prisoners and condemn the persecution of women or religious minorities or people who are lesbian gay bisexual or transgender
we do these things not only because they're right but because they make us safer
the remarks were a surprise but not entirely unexpected for a president who has made <unk> rights a quiet but consistent focus of his tenure in office
obama was also the first president to mention transgender individuals in any speech and last year signed an executive order extending protection against discrimination in the workplace for gay and transgender workers in the federal government
and he also called gay marriage a civil right in the wake of the supreme court's decision to take up the issue once and for all
i've seen something like gay marriage go from a wedge issue used to drive us apart to a story of freedom across our country a civil right now legal in states that seven in ten americans call home obama said
unfortunately his plan doesn't make the grade
the proposal would not only pile up more debt by further <unk> runaway college costs it would also <unk> undercut the emergence of more innovative educational programs designed to help students succeed in the workforce
offering only a lukewarm pathway to the job market community colleges are incapable of fulfilling the president's lofty ambitions
although there are some high performing community colleges and stellar stories of success for certain students the overall picture of success at two year community colleges is dismal
according to the community college research center at teachers college columbia university only twenty two percents of students graduate within three years and twenty eight percents graduate within four
more telling eighty percents of students say they want a bachelor's degree or higher and yet only twenty percents of these students transfer to a four year institution within five years
even for those who earn a community college degree it often isn't as useful as other options
thanks to <unk> inflation pursuing a professional certification which more clearly indicates a person's skills than a degree often pays off better than an <unk> degree according to census bureau data
the conversation around making community college free also masks a larger problem which is that community colleges are already heavily <unk> and far less affordable than commonly believed
at three thousand three hundred dollar community college tuition is well under the five thousand seven hundred and thirty dollar currently available in <unk> grant aid to low income students
but the expenditure per student at a community college the true cost of the education is far higher about four times more at thirteen thousand dollar per student
that means that more than sixty percents of the cost of community college isn't paid for through tuition but through various forms of government aid at the federal state and local levels
as a result even if the president's plan passed it wouldn't help the large number of already <unk> community colleges that have waiting lists <unk> in the thousands
tuition is only a small part of the funding needed to educate additional students
what's more because of the limited productivity gains possible in the community college model those costs will continue to rise which means that tuition will too
the <unk> sixty billion dollar price over ten years is likely to grow with only a questionable return on the investment
the larger question the proposal misses is not how to allow students to afford college but how to make college affordable
there's a huge distinction
the focus should be to make <unk> education less costly and of better quality such that the question of how to afford it becomes manageable
the president's proposal merely charges education in the form of debt for future generations of taxpayers rather than changes it
instead we need to encourage students to seek innovative offerings that are lower cost and improve the quality and accessibility of higher education
such options are emerging
<unk> university offers a new online <unk> based program that charges undergraduate tuition of three hundred and fifty dollar per month or one thousand three hundred and sixteen dollar per term
tuition includes access to as many courses as one can complete and all the <unk> and course materials needed and <unk> receives no government funding
another online <unk> based program southern new <unk> college for america charges annual tuition of two thousand five hundred dollar
rather than supporting innovative options like <unk> and southern new hampshire the president's plan would nudge students toward a community college sector that is incapable of <unk> its model around student success and fuel rising college costs
if enacted the president's proposal would be unlikely to achieve its ultimate aims and would exacerbate a larger problem lurking behind college financing
although the plan amounts to little more than political posturing given the current congressional makeup it will negatively influence the political conversation around higher education in the years ahead
by supporting free community college president obama is merely kicking the can down the road for future generations to confront
we need a better strategy for skills training overall before we go further down the track of <unk> students to attend community college only to emerge with little to show for it
wechat users typing in the phrase civil rights last weekend noticed a <unk> of stars and stripes <unk> down their screens much to the <unk> of some chinese customers who said that no special icons appeared when patriotic chinese terms were entered
when we entered words like national day china and the red flag with five stars nothing happened complained the <unk> provincial committee of the communist youth league in its official <unk> sunday night after posting pictures of its experiments
wechat could you explain why
in an online statement wechat owned by chinese tech giant <unk> clarified that its team had added the u.s. flag special feature in honor of the martin luther king jr. day in the united states on monday and had meant for it to be seen only by users in the u.s
a system error had caused users in other regions to use this feature as well read the statement which also apologized for the misunderstanding
the controversy over the stars and stripes comes as the chinese government under an increasingly powerful and <unk> conservative president xi jinping continues to tighten its grip over the cyberspace and beyond
the country's top internet <unk> has shut down one hundred and thirty three public wechat accounts for spreading distorted historical information about the ruling communist party state media reported tuesday
the same agency recently told the state controlled people's daily newspaper that china's six major web <unk> deleted more than three hundred and forty million pornographic or otherwise harmful posts last year as part of the government's cleaning up the internet campaign
earlier this week the communist leadership in beijing ordered universities nationwide to <unk> ideological control by studying and <unk> <unk> as well as <unk> and promoting the core values of socialism according to the state run xinhua news agency
while many applauded the communist youth league's criticism of <unk> flag feature other internet users called it narrow minded
referring to the attached screen grabs that <unk> show an apple device being used one of the most liked comments under the post shot back
a chinese communist youth league provincial committee using an american smartphone could you explain why
no crime to seek asylum we are in <unk> jail
he's been there for eighteen months and now finds himself witness to a mass hunger strike by as many as seven hundred fellow asylum seekers or transferees as they're called
he said he hasn't joined them because he fears that the respect he has in the compound means he could be singled out as a <unk> and that if he was taken to the medical center he wouldn't be allowed back
he has asked not to be named
photos sent from the mobile phone he keeps hidden from guards show dozens of hunger <unk> lying bare <unk> on the concrete floor of the detention compound
many people fall he wrote sending an image of man lying outside on the <unk> with the message
no power in his body
asylum seekers in the australian offshore processing center have been declining food for nine days
they're protesting against the <unk> government's plans to send around fifty confirmed refugees to another facility in <unk> the capital of <unk> province
the first of the transfers are due to start on thursday
both the <unk> and the australian governments have said that the move is only temporary and it's part of a program that will see some refugees <unk> elsewhere in <unk> new guinea
still the asylum seekers and government critics have expressed concerns
it's simply moving them to a different type of accommodation an accommodation that asylum seekers are fearful is not going to keep them safe from resentment in the local community said australian greens senator sarah <unk> young an outspoken critic of the government's policy
so fearful are they of moving some asylum seekers have resorted to self harm
the <unk> government has confirmed some have <unk> their lips together or swallowed washing powder or metal <unk> from disposable <unk>
authorities have not revealed how many people have been treated by medical staff at the site and information coming from advocates and those inside the prison is difficult to confirm
it's extremely challenging to verify the information that we're getting said amnesty international's graeme <unk> who said even under normal circumstances communication for the asylum seekers is very limited
on monday afternoon security forces ended a standoff with transferees in the delta compound one of four compounds at the center
the transferees had <unk> the gates so that no one could enter or leave
<unk> foreign affairs minister <unk> <unk> said the standoff was resolved peacefully with no serious injury
in contrast advocates said the compound came under attack by security forces and transferees were seen being dragged away in handcuffs
australian immigration minister peter <unk> on tuesday conceded a degree of force was involved but said the <unk> government deserved praise for its <unk> in handling the situation
earlier he accused some advocates of <unk> the situation by spreading false and misleading claims including reports the asylum seekers were being denied food and water
there are no false and misleading claims and the minister can't point to any said ian <unk> from the refugee action coalition in sydney
yet again the immigration department tends to point to some <unk> unnamed minority when it's really the government's policy that are really the driving force of the protests
conditions in the detention center have been the subject of criticism and complaint since it re opened in november two thousand and twelve as the primary site for the processing of offshore asylum claims for people who arrive in australian waters by boat
the australian government has said the center meets international obligations
since then the mental health of the transferees has suffered according to rights advocates and relations with the local community have been damaged to the point that the men fear for their lives outside the center's perimeter
they've had constant threats just last week that they will be killed that will settle accounts with them outside the detention center <unk> said
the worst of the threats started twelve months ago when a twenty three year old iranian asylum <unk> <unk> <unk> was killed after days of protests erupted into violence
dozens were injured during clashes between asylum seekers guards and locals who entered the facility
an independent report commissioned by the government into the riot found <unk> suffered a severe brain injury caused by a brutal beating by several assailants and died a few hours later
last summer two <unk> nationals were arrested including the alleged leader of the attack who had been employed at the center
the alleged involvement of locals and the fact that several alleged assailants may still be at large has raised fears inside the detention center that they'll be targeted if not protected
the government has said security is adequate and refugees can call on the police if needed
senator <unk> young visited the island before the riot in two thousand and thirteen and said even then it was clear to her that the local feeling of animosity toward the asylum seekers was pretty severe
the local community think they're criminals in a prison
they think they are people who must have done something wrong and they're being told that these people are going to be living in their community she said
but she said a lot of the ill feeling relates to the huge pay disparity between the local and the <unk> employees
the locals get paid four dollar point fifty and hour versus the forty five dollar per hour for <unk>
that has always an issue of contention that has led to a lot of resentment about the facility overall she said
from his contraband phone the <unk> sends more images of signs the words written neatly in capital letters on sheets hung in the compound
to australian government
stop <unk> us
if you think we don't deserve <unk>
then hand over all of us to the un
we don't want your help
the australian government has said the <unk> island transferees are free to return to afghanistan iraq iran or wherever they came from
if they ask they'll receive government assistance to go back
however senator <unk> young said that option is not being taken up by desperate people who once fled in fear of their lives
anyone who is still left here now is because they've got no other choice
asked why he doesn't volunteer to leave the <unk> texts
i will die if i go back
shin dong <unk> admission of his lies goes to prove that everything told by those who claim to be defectors from the north can not be trusted the state run kcna news agency said citing a spokesman for north korea's association for human rights studies
the government news agency called shin a <unk> who styled himself a survivor in the concentration camp of political offenders that does not exist in no more than a sheer lie and a fiction
shin's horrific descriptions of his time in a north korean prison camp became a best selling book made him a key witness before the united nations and grabbed headlines around the world
he was one of the most high profile north korean defectors winning several human rights awards and inspiring a documentary as his biography about escaping from a total control zone called camp fourteen was translated into twenty seven languages
but over the weekend the publisher of the book and its author said shin who claims to have been born in and escaped from a north korean prison camp had admitted several inaccuracies including the length of time he spent in camp fourteen
shin still maintains he was severely tortured but he's changed details about the dates and locations of what he says <unk>
north korea's statement tuesday says that shin's revelation shows that last year's human rights resolution that the u.n. general assembly passed criticizing north korea was no more than a false document cooked up on the basis of false testimonies made by human scum
advocates have said any inaccuracies in shin's story shouldn't undermine the staggering suffering he and other survivors of north korea's prison camps have helped bring to light
and the chairman of the u.n. commission of inquiry into north korea noted that shin was one of hundreds of witnesses adding that his testimony consisted of only two <unk> in a four hundred page report
it's a very small part of a very long story
and it really doesn't affect the credibility of the testimony said michael kirby chairman of the commission of inquiry into north korea
cnn has not been able to reach shin who noted in a facebook post apologizing for the inaccuracies in his story that these will be my final words and this will likely be my final post
in an opinion article he wrote for cnn digital last year shin noted that north korea had made repeated personal attacks against him
the dictatorship in north korea has never been honest or <unk> for more than six decades it has been in existence he wrote
north korea has repeatedly denied shin's claims and described testimony before the united nations commission by him and others as <unk>
in a video posted last year on a website that carries pro pyongyang propaganda shin's father denied that his son was ever in a prison camp
shin said in response that the government had taken his father hostage
in the united states the top one percents control more than one third of the nation's resources
two out of three americans disapprove of the current distribution of income and wealth
they believe that our economy and government unfairly favor the rich
one of the major contributors to rising inequality is our tax system
raising taxes on the very wealthy is an idea that appeals to many americans including the middle class and poor
in his state of the union address on tuesday night president barack obama will attempt to address this serious issue
he will propose a set of policies to increase taxes paid by big business and the wealthiest americans and provide tax cuts and credits for america's middle class
prominent economists think that the government needs to raise taxes on corporations and top <unk> to benefit the nation as a whole
republicans meanwhile are already <unk> about president obama's plan
one of the more curious phenomena about republicans is that their economic agenda is entirely independent of the facts of the moment
so when the economy is strong republicans demand tax cuts for the rich
when the economy is weak republicans demand tax cuts for the rich
when the economy is recovering republicans demand tax cuts for the rich
but the massive tax cuts for the wealthy under president george w. bush didn't stave off the recession and arguably <unk> or worsened the fall
moreover the nonpartisan congressional research service has conclusively determined that tax cuts for the rich do not spur economic growth
to the contrary there's evidence that tax cuts hurt growth
in fact the only thing tax cuts unequivocally do according to the study
tax cuts increase economic inequality
president obama is also proposing fees to make it more costly for the biggest financial companies to excessively borrow money
post recession corporate profits have soared but wages for americans workers have not
once upon a time corporate profits used to <unk> more closely with economic growth and wage prosperity for average americans
in other words we used to do well all together
but increasingly especially in the past decade thanks to republican tax cuts and <unk> corporations have succeeded while ordinary americans have fallen behind
how else do we explain the stock market hitting record highs while many americans are still out of work
this runaway train of inequality won't solve itself
we need government action action the majority of americans strongly support
in his state of the union address president obama will argue for closing the trust fund loophole which according to the white house is one of the biggest tax loopholes plaguing our economy and lets the wealthiest americans avoid hundreds of billions in taxes every year money that should be helping build roads and schools that help us all
president obama will also propose raising the top capital gains and <unk> rates back to what they were under president ronald reagan which clearly republicans once agreed was a sufficient level
and to hedge the sort of gambling that puts our entire economy at risk president obama will propose a fee on the nation's largest financial firms in proportion to how heavily they borrow and leverage
these modest measures will help us <unk> in america's middle class and strengthen our economy for everyone's benefit
among the president's proposals is a five hundred dollar tax credit for second <unk> in families where both spouses work a proposal that will benefit twenty four million american families
the president will endorse <unk> the child care tax benefit to help five point one million american families cover the cost of child care
president obama will provide students with up to two thousand five hundred dollar a year toward the cost of college and make the first two years of community college free
and president obama's plan includes giving thirty million more workers the opportunity to easily and automatically save for retirement through their employers
while american voters across the board think that democrats help the poor middle class and rich fairly equally sixty nine percents think republican party policies favor the rich
even conservative voters are concerned about rising inequality
the political pressure is on the gop to prove they're not just the party of the one percents
there are some encouraging signs that republicans believe tax reform should include increasing the share paid by the wealthiest americans
president obama's plan is a modest and effective set of policies that sensible republicans can support
the definition of <unk> is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results
we've cut taxes on big businesses and the rich to near historic lows
those tax cuts have only helped corporate profits and yacht sales
it's time that our economic policy helps all americans
in this economic and political climate not supporting basic tax fairness is insane
the terrorist explained that they would be executed in seventy two hours if isis isn't paid two hundred million dollar
japanese prime minister shinzo abe responded on tuesday saying the treatment of the hostages was unacceptable
isis had similarly demanded one hundred million euros in ransom for the release of james foley the american journalist who was killed by the terrorist group in syria in august
like the two hundred million dollar demand for the japanese hostages the foley demand was never a serious negotiation effort as it far exceeded the amounts of money paid for hostages held by jihadist militant groups in the past which typically have ranged up to several million dollars
but the demand does shine a light on two uncomfortable facts about kidnap and ransom or <unk> the dark <unk> of professionals who work to negotiate between murderous groups such as isis and the terrified families whose loved ones have been kidnapped
it also includes their worried employers and western governments such as france that will pay ransoms and other governments notably the united states and the united kingdom that will not
the first uncomfortable fact is that if you pay a ransom a hostage is more likely to be released
the other is that every time a ransom is paid it increases the chance that other hostages will be taken to help fill the coffers of a terrorist group
according to an investigation by the new york times al qaeda and its affiliates have netted at least one hundred and twenty five million dollar in ransoms since two thousand and eight
that finding is similar to a two thousand and twelve u.s. treasury estimate that one hundred and twenty million dollar had been paid to terrorist organizations during the previous eight years
much of this revenue reportedly comes from france
french media reported that the government had paid twenty million euros for the release of four employees of a french nuclear firm
they were held by an al qaeda affiliate for three years in northern niger and were released last year
the french government denied paying a ransom but the new york times indicated based on reports from le monde and agence france presse that france did pay in that case and has paid out a total of some fifty eight million dollar to al qaeda or related groups
opinion
why countries should think about paying ransoms
not surprisingly the times also found that of the fifty three hostages known to have been taken by al qaeda and its affiliates during the past five years a third were french
the french government's purported policy of negotiating with militant groups for the release of kidnapped citizens does appear to work
four french journalists nicolas henin pierre torres <unk> elias and didier franois who were kidnapped in syria last year by isis were released near the turkish border in april blindfolded and with their hands bound
one of those hostages henin had been held by isis alongside foley
henin is free and foley is dead
these are the facts that policymakers must confront as they consider what to do about the other western hostages still held by isis
so far isis has executed a number of western hostages including american journalist steven sotloff and u.s. aid worker peter kassig
isis continues to holds one american female aid worker
cnn is <unk> her name
for the hostages held by isis there is always the chance that their governments will mount a rescue operation as the united states did in syria in july two thousand and fourteen to try and rescue foley and the other americans
that mission failed because the hostages had been moved from a location they had been kept in for some months
there is also the possibility that hostages could escape as american photographer matthew <unk> did last year when he managed to crawl out of a window of the prison where he was being held in in the syrian city of aleppo by an islamist militant group
but such <unk> are rare and while successful rescue efforts do happen they are fraught with risks for the hostages
linda <unk> for instance a british aid worker held by the taliban in afghanistan in two thousand and ten was killed in a u.s. rescue operation likely by a grenade that exploded near her
if there's not an escape or a successful rescue effort western governments whose citizens are held by isis have only the options of either a negotiation involving ransom or the real possibility that their hostages may be executed
this is the sobering choice that has faced president barack obama and his national security advisers and now faces the japanese prime minister
last year obama ordered a review of u.s. hostage policy which is never to negotiate with terrorists
the review is reportedly supposed to examine issues such as family engagement intelligence collection and diplomatic engagement policies
but that seems to be rather missing the point
the real issue is
will a ransom be paid or not
an area of possible <unk> room would be to leave the door open so that ransoms for americans could be allowed to be paid not with u.s. government funds but with private donations
in such a case the government would simply look the other way when private donations were used to free an american hostage as paying money to a designated terrorist organization is a crime in the states
this is the least bad solution to a terrible <unk> which is if that if you don't pay the ransom the hostage dies and if you do pay the ransom you are helping a terrorist organization
boston police commissioner william evans said fifty five year old stephen pasceri of nearby <unk> came onto the second floor of the hospital where the cardiovascular unit is located and asked to speak with dr. michael davidson
pasceri shot davidson when he came to the <unk> between the waiting and exam rooms according to evans
pasceri was found dead of what was clearly a self inflicted gunshot wound evans said
<unk> sister <unk> <unk> told the boston herald that davidson had performed heart surgery on their mother <unk> pasceri who died in november
i think it comes down to the fact that my brother thought it was the doctor's fault that my mother died she told the herald
i don't know why my brother would blame him
i really don't know why
<unk> said pasceri worked at the milford based company waters corp. and had graduated from <unk> state with a degree in accounting
he had four children she said
we can't even wrap our brains around this she said
there was no indication whatsoever that he would ever do anything like this
he loved his mom and he loved her very much
he appeared to be handling her death well
i'm in shock i can't believe it
he was such a nice a man and beautiful family
it doesn't make any sense michelle <unk> a neighbor of stephen pasceri told cnn affiliate <unk>
it's hard to process
davidson forty four was the director of <unk> cardiac surgery at the hospital and an assistant professor at harvard medical school according to the hospital's website
davidson lived in <unk> massachusetts and graduated from the yale university school of medicine in one thousand nine hundred and ninety six
dr. davidson was a wonderful and inspiring cardiac surgeon who devoted his career to saving lives and improving the quality of life of every patient he cared for the hospital said in a statement
it is truly devastating that his own life was taken in this horrible manner
at a new conference wednesday colleagues remembered davidson as a loving father and devoted friend who played guitar in a band with other physicians
they set up the dr. michael j. davidson family fund in his memory
<unk> wife terri <unk> also a physician is seven months pregnant
they have two daughters ages seven and nine and a son who is two
one man taking his son to see a doctor said the scene at the hospital was <unk>
there was nothing but police officers with guns drawn and everyone was yelling witness james <unk> told cnn affiliate <unk>
people were falling down he said
some were crying
it was a very surreal situation
at least fifty democratic house members have already told moore's office they will join her during some of the <unk> applause lines when obama speaks about freedom of expression and the terror attacks in paris
we in no way want to disrupt the state of the union
we appreciate the fact that all members of congress will be here at one time to show support and solidarity said eric harris moore's press secretary who <unk> the idea
i think it's fair to say that we've never seen this type of political climate before and i think it's important that we show our support
the gesture became an international symbol of defiance at marches and rallies after terrorist attacked charlie hebdo which prominently featured controversial cartoons
plans for the unprecedented display on the house floor during the state of the union address are gathering steam harris said and he expects most members of the congressional black caucus and the congressional progressive caucus will join though he hopes for a strong bipartisan showing
democratic <unk> john <unk> barbara lee marcia fudge karen bass charlie rangel keith ellison jim mcgovern and mark <unk> were among the first to join moore harris said
but the effort has faced some push back from some who labeled it as a political stunt
that is in no way what we are trying to do here harris said
obama's state of the union wades into two thousand and sixteen
harris said he informed the white house and house democratic leadership of the plans and will give the white house a list of members who plan on participating
harris initially floated the idea through an email list of democratic press secretaries to gauge support but the idea quickly went public when someone with access to the chain leaked the information to the press
but harris said his boss was quickly on board with the plan and thought it would be a touching tribute
moore who broke her two feet and an arm during a bad fall over the holiday <unk> will raise a pencil on tuesday night while sitting in a wheelchair using her one good arm
the freshman senator from iowa pledged republicans will take the country on a new course that <unk> washington's stale mindset and called on obama to work with her party in the new congress
but ernst largely trained her sights on washington not obama during the under ten minute address
we heard the message you sent in november loud and clear
and now we're getting to work to change the direction washington has been taking our country ernst is expected to say
americans have been hurting but when we demanded solutions too often washington responded with the same stale mindset that led to failed policies like obamacare
it's a mindset that gave us political talking points not serious solutions
after obama highlighted improvements in the economy following continued decreases in the unemployment rate and an uptick in job creation ernst made it clear that the u.s. economy has not yet fully recovered and much more still remains to be done
ernst even talked about the sting of the economy as something many of us didn't have to read about but felt them every day
from stagnant wages and lost jobs to the hurt caused by canceled healthcare plans ernst painted a far less <unk> picture of the economy than obama presented moments before
we see too many moms and dads put their own dreams on hold while growing more fearful about the kind of future they'll be able to leave to their children ernst said
all while sticking to conservative republican policy ideas ernst also spoke about the potential for common ground with the president
there's a lot we can achieve if we work together ernst said in her rebuttal late tuesday night
that common ground includes tearing down trade barriers in europe and reforming the u.s. tax code both issue areas that republicans and democrats have heralded as potential bipartisan success stories
ernst even notes that obama has expressed his willingness to work with republicans on tax reform
but ernst also hit obama's signature health care law repeating the all but impossible goal of repealing and replacing obamacare
she also criticized obama over his opposition to a bill that would authorize the keystone xl pipeline which he recently threatened to veto
will he sign the bill or block good american jobs
ernst said
ernst who successfully pulled support from establishment and tea party groups during her election campaign also made note of plans to continue fighting for conservative causes
we'll defend life she said
ernst also signaled that the gop congress would fight to rein in obama's executive action on immigration vowing to correct executive <unk>
and speaking from the armed services committee room ernst also called for a comprehensive plan to defeat the forces of violence and oppression addressing renewed concerns over terrorism revived in the wake of terrorist attacks in paris that killed seventeen less than two weeks ago
we've been reminded of <unk> reach both at home and abroad
most recently in france and nigeria but also in places like canada and australia
our hearts go out to all the innocent victims of terrorism and their loved ones
we can only imagine the depth of their grief ernst said
the criminal complaint alleges that <unk> al abbadi and ali <unk> provided material support to the terrorist organization and conspired to murder americans abroad

al abbadi and <unk> may have operated in the mountains of afghanistan but now they face justice in a courtroom in brooklyn
the complaint which was unsealed on tuesday states that both <unk> and al abbadi were members of al qaeda and had both fought against u.s. forces in afghanistan
al abbadi had also fought in iraq <unk> u.s. military <unk> according to court documents
both men were arrested in saudi arabia and then transferred to u.s. custody
al abbadi had already served more than five years of a twelve year prison sentence in saudi arabia before he was handed over
judge lois bloom ordered al abbadi be held without bail until his trial was completed as he poses a danger to the community as an al qaeda operative with extensive weapon and explosives training according to <unk> ahmad one of the prosecutors handling the case
both <unk> and al abbadi face a maximum sentence of life in prison according to the release
al abbadi has not yet entered a plea in the case and his court appointed defense attorney refused to add anything after the hearing
the plane ascended suddenly with a speed that was above the normal speed limit and then it went up transportation minister ignasius jonan told reporters after he briefed lawmakers at a parliamentary hearing
afterward it stalled
at one point the plane was climbing at a speed of six thousand feet per minute jonan said
a fighter jet like the f a eighteen super <unk> can climb as fast as thirty thousand feet per minute
but commercial jets are designed to ascend at a much slower rate
the latest data show the airasia plane an airbus a three hundred and twenty was climbing at a rate twice as fast as it could and should do on its own cnn aviation analyst mary schiavo said
i think that means there was a tremendous amount of winds and weather she said
the commercial jet lost contact with air traffic controllers on december twenty eight as it flew from the indonesian city of surabaya toward singapore with one hundred and sixty two people on board
amid increasingly bad weather one of the pilots had requested to deviate from the plane's planned route airasia has said
and experts have speculated since day one that storms might have played a role in the plane crash
if the plane was climbing at six thousand feet per minute schiavo said numerous alarms would have sounded in the cockpit
but if the aircraft got caught in an <unk> she said the pilots might not have been aware at first of why it was climbing so quickly when they weren't <unk> that into the controls
picture your <unk> showing your car accelerating when your foot isn't pressing on the gas pedal
the pilots would have had control of the plane she said but may not have even realized what was occurring because of the confusing readings from the aircraft
last week searchers recovered the plane's flight data and voice data recorders which investigators hope will help them determine what happened aboard the doomed flight
indonesian investigators say audio recordings from the plane's cockpit contain no sounds of gunfire or explosions making it unlikely the plane was brought down by terrorism
while transportation officials focus on figuring out what happened search teams are still looking for most of the bodies of the people who were on board the plane
more than three weeks after the crash the remains of fifty three people have been recovered some of them still strapped into seats
many of the rest could be in the wreckage of the fuselage which searchers located last week at the bottom of the sea
efforts to examine and get inside the wreckage have been hindered by high waves and strong currents
in a video posted tuesday to social media a black clad isis militant stood over two men he said were japanese citizens
both would die he said unless the japanese government paid the islamist extremist group two hundred million dollar within seventy two hours
that isis wants ransom isn't unexpected
but a few things like the public nature and staggering amount of the request make it stand out
yes
it's hard to quantify all the examples because hostage takers in ambitious militant groups like isis rarely make their demands public
but just as kidnappings are the norm for such groups so is asking for ransom
one documented example is the case of james foley an american journalist abducted in northern syria in november two thousand and twelve
isis would later demand one hundred million euros for his release said richard byrne a spokesman for the news website <unk> that foley <unk> for before
neither <unk> nor <unk> family nor the u.s. government paid that amount
even if they had there's no telling if isis would have kept its word and freed foley
instead the group not only beheaded foley but recorded his killing and put it online for the world to see
one thing that makes the latest ransom request unique is that isis made it publicly and set a three day deadline for it to be met
this suggests as much posturing as fundraising especially when coupled with its decrying japan for supporting governments involved in the anti isis fight
isis rationale seems similar to other terror groups
kidnappings help raise money and if ransoms aren't paid make a point such as the groups are not to be <unk> with and even civilians are in danger
<unk> the public relations strategy of a group like isis can be a challenge
but there's no doubt the group uses modern technology to get the word out on its captives including when they are beheaded
such pictures further the image of isis as a ruthless defiant organization dedicated to wiping out anyone soldiers or civilians who doesn't follow its extreme conservative version of sharia law
the money making aspect is more under the radar but still significant
the u.s. treasury department estimated in two thousand and twelve that al qaeda and its affiliates compiled one hundred and twenty million dollar from ransoms over the previous eight years
and a new york times investigative piece from july two thousand and fourteen determined that al qaeda and its affiliates took in one hundred and twenty five million dollar since two thousand and eight including sixty six million dollar in two thousand and thirteen alone
there hasn't been a similarly detailed review for isis but that doesn't mean ransoms in addition to things like oil revenues criminal enterprises as well as taxes tolls and other fees imposed on those in its territories aren't a significant part of the group's budget
countries don't advertise how much they pay in ransom
doing so could invite kidnappers to seize their citizens for ransom
but that doesn't mean some countries don't do it
the summer two thousand and fourteen new york times article citing french media reports identified france as the country that pays out the most to al qaeda affiliates
france's reported fifty eight million dollar figure since two thousand and eight is far higher than the next highest total twenty million dollar as paid out from oman and qatar
the times reports that switzerland paid out twelve million dollar spain eleven million dollar and austria three million dollar in the same time frame
it's not just al qaeda that france has dealt with
four french journalists taken captive by isis were released last april
a group's ransom request could depend on a lot of factors
a high profile hostage for instance could demand a higher price
and a solitary <unk> may ask less than one belonging to a large powerful defiant group especially one like isis that's proved its willingness to kill civilians
the amount of ransom requested and paid apparently has gone up
a decade ago the times reported that a standard asking price might be two hundred thousand dollar
nowadays it's more likely to be in the millions
phil <unk> <unk> ceo told cnn that european governments have paid between two million dollar and four million dollar for hostages
but it is not two hundred million dollar as was requested for the two japanese hostages
nor is it the one hundred and thirty two million dollar requested for foley
both figures from isis are exceedingly high and seem to suggest the group is as interested in making a point as it is in making money given the <unk> it will be paid
on tuesday japanese prime minister shinzo abe did not rule out paying a ransom or negotiating with his two citizens captors
does that mean tokyo is willing to pay or at least talk
not necessarily
japan hasn't said it has paid ransoms before and there's no reason to think the country would in this case
japan signed a two thousand and thirteen g eight <unk> that stated we unequivocally reject the payment of ransoms to terrorists and we call on countries and companies around the world to follow our lead to stamp this out
this policy mirrors those of the united kingdom and the united states with <unk> mother diane telling cnn that a u.s. official once threatened her with prosecution if she tried to raise ransom on her own
why wouldn't countries like these two and japan tap into their relatively vast resources to save the lives of their citizens
for one thing groups like isis and al qaeda may not be the most trustworthy so paying up won't necessarily guarantee a release
and it might end up putting others at risk both by encouraging more kidnappings and funding those behind mass killings
as under secretary for terrorism and financial intelligence david s. cohen argued in two thousand and twelve ransom payments lead to future kidnappings and future kidnappings lead to additional ransom payments
and it all builds the capacity of terrorist organizations to conduct attacks
some say that countries with no ransom policies can end up giving militant groups incentives to kidnap more people if they negotiate with them
this debate raged after the taliban's release of u.s. army sgt
bowe bergdahl last year in exchange for five taliban figures then in u.s. military custody at guantanamo bay cuba
president barack obama said afterward i make absolutely no apologies for making sure we get a young man back to his parents
in japan's case such a prisoner swap isn't an option
it's not as if the country has a lot of suspected isis members in its custody
so tokyo's bargaining chips might consist more of doing something like not giving two hundred million dollar to those invested in the anti isis fight a pledge that abe said tuesday he's not willing to <unk>
isis history shows there may not be a lot but it's possible that there will be talks with the isis hostage takers
japan can point to the fact that unlike the united states and britain it's not involved directly with the military effort in iraq or syria
isis might surprise everyone by freeing the japanese pair as a goodwill gesture
but absent a last ditch diplomatic effort japan may have to rely on military forces from allies in the west the middle east or elsewhere to rescue its citizens
whatever the approach time is clearly running out
prosecutor alberto nisman was found dead in his apartment just one day before he was supposed to testify before lawmakers about allegations that the country's most powerful officials conspired to cover up iran's involvement in the one thousand nine hundred and ninety four bombing
government officials called it a suicide but theories of something more <unk> arose immediately
protesters took to the streets monday night near the presidential palace the <unk> <unk> waving argentine flags and holding signs proclaiming yo soy nisman or i am nisman
in a report nisman filed last week he alleged that argentine president cristina fernandez de <unk> and foreign minister hector timerman among others covered up iran's involvement in the bombing of a jewish community center more than twenty years ago that left eighty five people dead
the fernandez government pushed the suicide theory pointing to the evidence
nisman was found dead from a gunshot wound to his temple in his apartment bathroom <unk> caliber gun and a shell casing near his body
but a test for gunpowder residue on nisman's hands came back negative said <unk> fein the federal prosecutor leading the investigation into his death
fein said the result does not rule out the possibility that nisman shot himself it only shows that no gunpowder residue was found as would be expected if he pulled the trigger
fein had said earlier that the medical examiner concluded that there was no third party involved in nisman's death
an investigation into the suicide claim has to include a look at whether such an act was provoked or induced by some other person she said
for protesters in buenos aires plaza de mayo the prosecutor's death struck a deeper chord
the killing of nisman will mobilize the argentine people to put an end to the corruption to end this state of disaster that we live in here in argentina one protester said
one woman compared the country's politicians to the mafia and another said that argentine democracy was not a democracy anymore
the investigation into the deadliest bombing in argentina's history led nisman down a trail that he seemingly understood to be dangerous
after filing the complaint last week against the president foreign minister and other officials he made a prescient comment about the investigation
i could end up dead from this nisman told a reporter
twice
his <unk> came true the next day
diego guelar a former argentine ambassador to the united states told cnn en espaol that the suicide explanation is ridiculous
nisman was committed to his investigation which he had been overseeing since two thousand and four guelar said
the prosecutor voluntarily wanted to testify before congress about what he considered <unk> evidence of a governmental cover up regarding the one thousand nine hundred and ninety four bombing guelar said
without a doubt this is an incident that has shocked all <unk> very strongly he said
the fernandez administration hit back sharply after nisman's complaint was filed last week denying that there was a cover up about iranian links to the bombing of the argentine israelite mutual association building
prosecutors in argentina have alleged for years that iran was behind the attack but a criminal investigation has stalled in part because iran denies the charges and has not made the accused available to prosecutors
argentina requested the arrest of several iranians in two thousand and seven in connection with the bombing including the current defense minister of iran ahmad vahidi
interpol approved so called red notices for these suspects alerting countries around the world of buenos aires desire to have them arrested
to surpass this roadblock fernandez signed an agreement with iran to create a joint commission to investigate the bombing
she said it would move the investigation along while critics said such a probe would only protect the iranian suspects
in his report nisman alleged that fernandez and timerman wanted to cover up iran's involvement in order to boost trade specifically oil imports and grain exports with the islamic republic
suicide <unk> in all cases first
disbelief and then
questions
what was it that led a person to make the terrible decision to take his own life
fernandez wrote in a lengthy letter she posted on her facebook page
she hailed her own involvement in the investigation into the bombing dating back to her time as a lawmaker in the early two thousand s. as the investigation progressed politically motivated conspiracy theories and allegations arose she said
as time goes on instead of clarifying everything becomes more opaque fernandez wrote
it became complicated and there was a growing sensation at least for me of being in a theater of national and international politics in which the victims were important to very few and the truth even more so
nisman's allegations of a cover up she said were intended to lie <unk> and confuse
in the wake of nisman's death a judge has ordered that all of the the evidence collected by the prosecutor be preserved said patricia bullrich an argentine lawmaker and head of the committee that invited nisman to testify
nisman's role was to investigate the bombing in which eight iranians had been charged bullrich told cnn en espaol
in the course of that investigation nisman came upon evidence that led to his claims of a cover up the lawmaker said
after nisman filed his complaint with the new allegations last week it was bullrich who invited him to speak before congress
he was found dead just hours before he was supposed to testify
in the days before his death on sunday the prosecutor was very active very focused on the presentation he was going to give before congress in the evidence he was going to present and his mind made up about going forward with it bullrich said
it's hard to believe that he would have taken his own life
in sanaa on tuesday the presidential palace was overrun by shiite houthi rebels a situation the country's minister of information described as the completion of a coup
that's a problem for the united states which has relied on the government in yemen as an ally in battling the al qaeda affiliate that's based there
a power vacuum could benefit al qaeda in the arabian peninsula the terrorist offshoot that u.s. officials consider the most dangerous branch of the global jihadi network
obama himself cited the u.s. yemen partnership when he announced in september he was going after isis terrorists in iraq and syria
explaining why he was ruling out sending american troops to fight isis obama said he was modeling his strategy after what he said were successful efforts in yemen and somalia to partner with governments to go after terrorists
this strategy of taking out terrorists who threaten us while supporting partners on the front lines is one that we have successfully pursued in yemen and somalia for years obama said on september ten
it is consistent with the approach i outlined earlier this year
to use force against anyone who threatens america's core interests but to mobilize partners wherever possible to address broader challenges to international order
what that strategy relied on however was a strong partnership between the united states and the existing government in yemen led by president abdu rabu mansour hadi
hadi reorganized yemen's military to better go after aqap a strategy that worked for a time
but the plan was <unk> when resources were diverted to battle the militant houthis a shiite group who say they feel marginalized in the majority sunni country
republicans have seized upon the latest news from yemen to illustrate their opposition to obama's terrorism strategy
sen. john mccain now the chairman of the senate armed services committee tweeted the success story of yemen continues to unfold on tuesday followed by a link to a news report about the violence there
when pressed by cnn in september whether u.s. efforts in yemen could be described as a success the white house said the strategy there has worked
yemen is a place where the american counterterrorism strategy that has been put in place by president obama has succeeded in degrading the threat that those organizations pose to the united states press secretary josh earnest said
we intend to implement an analogous strategy against isil
during tuesday's state of the union obama will talk broadly about our counterterrorism strategy as part of our national security strategy and as part of our way to make sure american principles are held up throughout the world according to white house spokesman eric schultz
a senior administration official said obama was being updated on the situation in yemen by his national security team
we strongly condemn the violence and those stoking it in an effort to disrupt yemen's political transition
we will continue to support efforts to bring about a peaceful solution the official said
residents in nearby cities were told not to drink the tap water which some said smelled like diesel
the massive oil spill happened when the twelve inch pipeline which crosses the <unk> river <unk> saturday about five miles <unk> from <unk> <unk> department of environmental quality said
the <unk> pipeline company shut down the pipeline
<unk> city council member gerald reichert was among the residents who noticed a disturbing odor in the drinking water
suddenly at our house there was a definite smell
it was a diesel smell reichert told the grand <unk> herald
montana gov
steve <unk> announced a state of emergency for dawson and <unk> counties
and while officials wait for results from water sample testing they're advising residents to use bottled water for drinking and cooking
a host of agencies have responded to the oil spill including the environmental protection agency and the department of health and human services
adding to the problems the weather
the <unk> river is partially frozen making it difficult to clean up the mess
this isn't the first major oil spill into the <unk> river the longest <unk> river in the united states
in two thousand and eleven up to forty two thousand gallons poured out of a <unk> <unk> <unk> pipeline
so far there has been no decision to evacuate the embassy
the uss <unk> <unk> and the uss fort <unk> were moved because they will be in the best position if asked by the state department to evacuate the embassy a u.s. official with direct knowledge of the planning tells cnn
so far there has been decision to evacuate the embassy and no request from the state department for military assistance
if an evacuation is ordered the first option would be to have embassy personnel drive to the commercial airport in sanaa and fly out the official said
but in the wake of an embassy car being fired tuesday the safety of the roads in the capital is now being constantly evaluated the official said
if embassy workers did drive to the airport it is likely some sort of air cover would be provided under the current plan
other detailed military planning for various options has been finalized the official said
those options would be used if a request for military assistance were made
if helicopters and v twenty two aircraft from the ships are sent to sanaa it would be a complex operation that could last for several days to fully evacuate several hundred americans from the embassy the official cautioned
nobody should think this would be easy
the military is aware the state department wants to keep the embassy open as long as possible the official said noting that it's a valuable tool to monitor al qaeda in yemen
but behind the scenes the pentagon is pressing the point that if an evacuation becomes necessary they want to do it before the chaos in sanaa <unk> into a non <unk> environment akin to combat
for now the us believes the houthis are not targeting americans but its not clear if that will last
the plan at this point only involves the potential evacuation of state department personnel
it would be up to state to decide if it wants to extend the potential mission to other americans in yemen

for once four time winners roger federer or novak djokovic are not center stage and tennis <unk> rafael nadal has been <unk> out in melbourne
the face of the fortnight belongs to homegrown hope nick kyrgios the highest ranked australian on the men's tour
wearing fluorescent sneakers <unk> socks and a sharp <unk> the world no
fifty <unk> typical australian surfer cool on court but he has mixed feelings about his new found status
they could have chosen a lot more better looking people than me kyrgios jokes to open court presenter pat cash in an interview before the first grand slam of the new tennis season started
when i saw myself up on a poster here
well it's just great to be play in front of a home crowd
i'm really excited
kyrgios first sent the green and gold clad home fans into a frenzy when he won the australian open boys singles title in two thousand and thirteen
a meteoric two thousand and fourteen season then saw the <unk> big <unk> rise from world <unk> hundred and eighty six to nadal's <unk> at wimbledon
kyrgios became the first wild card in a decade to reach the quarterfinals of the grass court grand slam firing a career high thirty seven <unk> past the two time wimbledon champion and <unk> him with an array of trick shots
tennis experts immediately picked him out as future champion a successor to australia's last grand slam star <unk> hewitt winner of the two thousand and two wimbledon crown
that's a match i'm never going to forget smiles kyrgios now ranked as world no
fifty
that was the best serving and returning performance i've had in my life
every time i get out on court i'm always thinking about it
it is confidence and motivation to train hard
when you're injured to know that you can play at that level it's motivation to get healthy and get back out on the court
that's a reference to when the <unk> season hit the rocks in september because of fatigue and a <unk> back injury after his wimbledon whirlwind and a solid third round appearance at the u.s. open
those injuries might be another reason for kyrgios reluctance to get caught up in the hype ahead of the australian open which began in melbourne monday
his competitive tour return at the sydney international five days before the start of the australian open ended in a first round defeat by <unk> <unk> <unk>
the nineteen year old australian had little time to get match fit for his home grand slam so a five set <unk> past argentina's <unk> <unk> was probably not what he needed in the first round
one of two australian players to reach round four kyrgios is determined not to get sucked into the pressure of home expectation
<unk> i'm not going to put too much pressure on myself he says
but i'd love to go out there and make a run like at wimbledon
i definitely think i can make an impact if i'm healthy and feeling good
i can definitely match up with some of the best
there is a lot of expectation
i'm still young i'm still <unk>
i understand that it's a long journey and i'm ready for that
life on the <unk> professional tennis tour means the nineteen year old is getting used to making personal sacrifices
he started playing tennis at seven encouraged by his malaysian mother <unk> who he promised to send a smiley face text to him after his victory over nadal
his dad george and older sister <unk> were in london to share in his success but his grandmother who kyrgios describes as a massive part of my life died just a week after his wimbledon breakthrough
kyrgios is beginning the new season with the number seventy four in homage to his grandmother <unk> on his finger
i'm still trying to deal with some things in my life that have changed he explains
sacrificing time at home <unk> out tournaments week after week
i'm still learning how to deal with being away from friends and family
i think i'm dealing with it pretty well but i'm still a kid
the australian may only be at the start of his senior career but he is already learning from the best his idol federer
if i was to build my game around someone it would be roger adds <unk>
he's the greatest of all time
it's extraordinary how consistent he's been
i got an opportunity to train with roger in zurich for a week last year
it was such a good opportunity to see what he would do on the practice court and his ability to create drills for himself to develop his game
he's still striving to get so much better and develop his game
that's what i learned so much from
federer entered the australian open as the men's second seed behind djokovic while kyrgios was relieved of some pressure by being <unk>
if he has doubts over this poster boy status the australian is looking forward to playing the role of crowd <unk>
being able to get the crowd involved hit shots they're going to love that's what <unk> me most he smiles
playing on courts like the rod laver arena it just gives me <unk> thinking about it
i'll try to keep the crowd going for as long as i can
our latest estimate today is that india has seventy percents of the world's tiger population and we have now two thousand two hundred and twenty six tigers <unk> in forty seven tiger reserves up from one thousand seven hundred and six in two thousand and eleven and this is a great achievement
it is a net increase of thirty percents over the last <unk> environment minister <unk> <unk> said in a statement monday
researchers involved in the study the third of its kind carried out in india say they used advanced technology to assess the population of the big cats
debbie banks head of the tiger campaign at the environmental investigation agency which carries out extensive research on the illegal tiger trade welcomed news of the study saying she looked forward to seeing the full report when it releases in march
i think it has set india apart from some of the other tiger range countries
if you look at china <unk> cambodia vietnam thailand there's more emphasis on tigers in captivity farming and valuing tigers for their body parts higher than the survival of tigers in the wild she says to cnn
india's once thriving tiger population has been severely affected by poaching a reduction in prey habitat destruction and conflict with villagers who may occupy the same area
although preliminary results of the government's study are promising banks warns against complacency
while this is good news from india i don't think anyone is sitting back and saying we've won
the demand within china for <unk> to <unk> homes and bones for tiger bone wine all continue
and so it's a constant battle
a major challenge is also the sophistication of the tiger trade where body parts of the animal are transported across unofficial borders such as mountain passes
the criminals have changed their practice
and there's no evidence of any enforcement there she says
a historical symbol of power and beauty in cultures such as india and china the significance of the tiger goes beyond its aesthetics banks says
tigers are major indicator of the health of the environment certainly the health of the forest that they inhabit
but they are the water gods if you like
they are indicators of how well we are doing to <unk> forests that provide water for millions of people and mitigate climate change
there's an ecosystem reason to save wild tigers
and if today's results are anything to go by banks says india appears to be leading that charge
india despite all the problems it has with high human population in small areas is totally setting the benchmark for wild tiger conservation
a day earlier ukrainian prime minister <unk> yatsenyuk said russian troops had crossed the border to support pro russian rebels
ukraine and the west for months have accused russia of supporting rebels in eastern ukraine by sending in russian troops weapons and supplies
the united states and european countries have imposed economic sanctions on russia over its involvement in ukraine while russian officials have frequently denied claims their military has sent forces to bolster the rebels
on tuesday russian defense ministry spokesman maj. gen. igor <unk> said monday's allegations were designed to attract sympathy and investment for ukraine at this week's gathering of political and business leaders in davos switzerland
yatsenyuk according to ukraine's state run media said monday that his country's military confirmed the fact military personnel and equipment have been transferred from russia to ukraine
tanks grad multiple rocket systems <unk> and <unk> systems radio electronic intelligence systems are not sold at local donetsk street markets
only the russian army and defense ministry have them yatsenyuk said
the prime minister's spokeswoman <unk> <unk> confirmed to cnn the quotes attributed to yatsenyuk are accurate
unrest in ukraine began with protests in the country's capital last year after pro moscow president viktor yanukovych favoring closer ties to russia dropped plans to sign a political and economic agreement with the european union
after months of protests and days of deadly clashes between demonstrators and security personnel in kiev parliament ousted yanukovych in february
weeks later russia annexed the crimean peninsula
in april violence broke out in two ukrainian regions that border russia donetsk and luhansk as separatist leaders declared independence from the government in kiev
pro russian separatists have claimed control of parts of donetsk and luhansk since the spring despite a push by ukrainian forces to defeat them
from mid april to september sixteen alone at least three thousand five hundred people were killed and at least eight thousand one hundred others were wounded in the conflict according to the united nations
nearly one hundred and thirty thousand pages of declassified air force files on ufo investigations and sightings are now available in one place online
declassified government records about <unk> have long existed on <unk> in the national archives in washington dc
many of them also live on websites devoted to the topic sometimes free sometimes not
but ufo enthusiast john <unk> says his database project blue book collection is the first to compile every single declassified document from the blue book project headquartered at wright patterson air force base in ohio from one thousand nine hundred and forty seven to one thousand nine hundred and sixty nine in one place for anyone to search or download for free
the collection consists of files from project blue book project sign and project <unk> the names given to official investigations into unidentified flying objects by the united states military
<unk> efforts are not motivated by a close encounter or personal experience with unidentified flying objects
he says he's just driven by curiosity
i'm a history buff
i think this stuff should be accessible he said
secrets are not bad things
i think we should know about this and it should be in history books
<unk> started requesting information related to project blue book through the freedom of information act fifteen years ago
his interest was <unk> by the first case he received information on about a one thousand nine hundred and seventy ufo incident in iran after project blue book ended
it defied explanation he said and five thousand <unk> later my curiosity hasn't gone away
the collection contains ten thousand <unk> each representing a different case
the files include the details of some of the most famous ufo cases including the <unk> incident the kenneth arnold <unk> and the <unk> crash
still <unk> believes the contents are just the tip of the iceberg
it's all a puzzle he said
just when you think you've got all the pieces to make a picture you realize it's only a piece of a bigger puzzle
the blue book project was <unk> after a joint review concluded that no significant information had come from it according to declassified documents on the national archives website
specifically the review said no ufo reported investigated and evaluated ever gave any indication of threat to our national security
nor did the investigations suggest that the sightings represent technological developments or principles beyond the range of present day scientific knowledge a one thousand nine hundred and eighty five wright patterson fact sheet said
since project blue book was closed nothing has happened to indicate that the air force ought to resume investigating <unk>
<unk> is not so sure especially not after viewing all the documents which are full of blacked out material
if the u.s. military can't identify some unidentified flying objects then who can he wonders
and what are they
the biggest takeaway for me is don't believe the company line he said
i think something big is going on
how big i don't think anyone will know for quite some time because government continues to make the rules
it's a hard game to when they make the rules and they're the referee
in a nine zero opinion written by justice samuel alito the court said that the prison policy in this case violated a federal statute designed to protect the religious exercise of prisoners
alito said that the policy as applied to this case violates the religious land use and institutionalized persons act which prohibits a state or local government from taking any action that substantially burdens the religious exercise of an institutionalized person unless the government demonstrates that the action constitutes the least restrictive means of <unk> a compelling government interest
correction officials had argued that the policy was put in place to protect other inmates and deter individuals from attempting to hide contraband
this is a huge win for religious freedom and for all americans said eric <unk> deputy general counsel for the <unk> fund for religious freedom who was co counsel in the case
what the supreme court said today was that government officials can not impose arbitrary restrictions on religious liberty just because they think government knows best
the decision is a significant victory for the inmate gregory holt and his religious liberty claims but alito made clear that existing law still <unk> prison officials ample ability to maintain security
gregory <unk> of americans united for separation of church and state who filed a brief in favor of holt said on tuesday the ruling means the justices want a good reason in order to burden an inmate's religious exercise
here the prison supplied only its say so
it offered no evidence that allowing mr. holt to wear a one two inch beard would threaten prison security other inmates or anyone else
<unk> said
alito wrote we readily agree that the department has a compelling interest in <unk> the flow of contraband into an within its facilities but the argument that this interest would be seriously compromised by allowing an inmate to grow a one two inch beard is hard to take seriously
he said an item of contraband would have be be very small indeed to be concealed by a one two inch beard
a significant problem for arkansas is that more than forty other states and the federal prisons allow a one half inch beard
in two thousand and ten holt was convicted of first degree <unk> and sentenced to life
five years earlier he had pleaded guilty to threatening to kidnap and harm the daughters of president george w. bush
in a handwritten petition holt asked that the justices take up his case because the no beard <unk> policy violated his rights to practice islam as he believes it is supposed to be practiced by wearing the beard
he said he was a devoted <unk> muslim
related opinion
why you should care about a muslim inmate's beard
in court papers david a. <unk> arkansas deputy attorney general had argued that the court should give deference to the <unk> security objectives
he said that <unk> was not intended to elevate accommodation of religious <unk> over an <unk> need to maintain order and safety

in that case a divided court ruled in favor of the religious freedom claims of closely held for profit corporations with sincerely held religious objections to including a full range of contraceptives in their insurance plans
ginsburg said unlike the exemption this court approved in burwell v. hobby lobby accommodating <unk> religious belief in this case would not <unk> affect others who do not share <unk> belief

after his first masters victory in two thousand and twelve watson recalled that his father had always hoped that he would become a baseball player rather than a golfer and now he has done the next best thing by buying a stake in florida outfit the <unk> blue wahoos
the wahoos are based around twenty miles from <unk> the small town in which the <unk> golf star grew up
but the thirty six year old who last year took <unk> practice with wahoos players before their game against the mobile <unk> was quick to stress that majority owners <unk> and <unk> <unk> wouldn't be letting him live out his dream of playing for the team
in a wahoos statement announcing the deal watson explained
you won't see me out there in a uniform
i already asked and they said i can't do that even if i own part of the team
ever since i went to my first blue wahoos game i have been a big fan
i love the atmosphere
it's such a great place to go with friends and family
there's something special about pulling for the hometown team
it's great that <unk> and <unk> were willing to let me be a part of it and i look forward to a long and exciting partnership with them
i just hope <unk> doesn't get tired of my crazy ideas because i have been known to have a few
the <unk> said they were delighted that watson had come on board with <unk> <unk> adding
<unk> bubba and i all view the wahoos as an investment in improving the quality of life for people
together we will continue to create great experiences for all ages make lifelong memories for our fans be a super place to work and now with <unk> leadership we will gain a national and international awareness for the blue wahoos and northwest florida
<unk> arrival has already made a mark on the wahoos <unk> <unk> stadium the bar and restaurant has been <unk> <unk> sand trap in his <unk> and <unk> fans will be able to enjoy a bubba <unk> grilled <unk> sandwich that also includes hash <unk>
the <unk> capacity of a little over five thousand fans is regularly filled and earlier this year the arena was ranked twelve th in the top one hundred u.s. sports venues and experiences by stadium journey magazine
the movie is drawing huge crowds across the <unk> and political spectrum from left leaning cities to conservative small towns
its audiences include large <unk> of women and older viewers two groups that don't typically flock to the <unk>
american sniper has the look of a bona fide cultural phenomenon
all of which has hollywood executives and a lot of other people scrambling to understand why
the movie has no doubt benefited from good timing
it hit three thousand five hundred theaters the day after <unk> six oscar nominations including best picture
but oscar love doesn't always translate to popular success the hurt locker the two thousand and nine best picture winner about a u.s. army bomb disposal team in iraq earned only seventeen million dollar in north america over its entire run
and until now audiences have mostly stayed away from films about the unpopular wars in iraq and afghanistan
so why has american sniper distributed by warner bros. which is owned by time warner the parent company of cnn struck a chord when so many other modern day war movies have not
here are five reasons
we're finally ready for a movie about the iraq war
it's been three years since the u.s. involvement in iraq formally ended and we have some distance on it
with the vast majority of u.s. troops out of harm's way audiences may finally be receptive to a movie that no longer hits too close to home
we saw a similar pattern after the vietnam war in the one thousand nine hundred and seventy s. although hollywood movies about that war were made while it was still being fought the most acclaimed vietnam war dramas the deer hunter coming home <unk> now began hitting u.s. theaters three to four years after the one thousand nine hundred and seventy five fall of <unk>
wrote iraq veteran and film producer paul <unk> in a recent column for variety
most of america is tired of hearing about iraq
but now they're at least open to being entertained by it
it's about someone many view as a hero
while characters in other recent combat movies such as zero dark thirty have been loosely based on actual people american sniper is based on a firsthand account by a navy seal who served four tours in iraq
chris kyle was already a legend in military circles thanks to his one hundred and sixty confirmed kills
his two thousand and twelve memoir american sniper
the autobiography of the most lethal sniper in u.s. military history spent months on the best seller lists
as portrayed by bradley cooper in the movie kyle was about as <unk> american as they come
a god fearing good <unk> boy from texas who loved hunting <unk> his family and his country
after kyle died in two thousand and thirteen thousands filled cowboys stadium outside dallas for a memorial service
his funeral procession stretched for two hundred miles
most of the conversation about what happened with our country in iraq is negative
this is a positive portrayal said cnn senior media correspondent brian <unk>
this is a film with an american hero
however some critics on the left have questioned whether hollywood is <unk> a bloodthirsty soldier who called iraqis <unk> and wrote in his book that his only regret is that i didn't kill more
for weeks audiences have been seeing a <unk> trailer for the movie that shows cooper as kyle his rifle and scope trained on two iraqi civilians in fallujah who may or may not be trying to bomb a u.s. military convoy
i've got a woman and a kid two hundred yards out moving towards the convoy
she's got a grenade
she handed it to the kid he says into his radio his finger closing on the trigger
your call comes the reply from the radio
the tense scene is <unk> with <unk> from kyle's life back home in texas including his wedding and the birth of a child
then we're back to the iraqi street and kyle's split second dilemma
they fry you if you're wrong his fellow soldier tells him as kyle stares down the <unk>
we can hear his breathing
we hear music swelling <unk>
we see the kid start running towards the american troops
we don't know what happens next but we want to find out
it's a human story not a political one
american sniper has no <unk> politicians or speeches about the <unk> of war
it's just kyle's story from before basic training to after he returns home for good
it doesn't deal with whether we should have been there or what we were doing there said cnn's <unk>
it only deals with the reality of what it was like for one soldier once he was there
so it's a soldier's eye point of view
people with opposing opinions on the war might all find evidence in the movie to support their views
military hawks could see the iraqis who are portrayed in the film almost entirely as insurgents bent on killing americans as <unk> who must be <unk> out
opponents of the conflict might see its effects on <unk> character who becomes <unk> and withdrawn as further proof of the <unk> effects of the war on returning soldiers
still almost everything can be <unk> if you try and american sniper is no exception
many conservatives upset with what they saw as the <unk> ambiguous anti military <unk> of such recent iraq war films as the matt damon thriller green zone have hailed american sniper as a tribute to an american patriot
a review on right wing website breitbart dot com called it a patriotic pro war on terror <unk>
meanwhile documentary filmmaker michael moore expressed a more controversial view in a tweet that called snipers cowards
opinion
why i refuse to see american sniper
one of the most popular and charismatic young actors in hollywood cooper has now been nominated for an acting oscar three years in a row
to play kyle he gained more than thirty pounds of muscle and mastered the <unk> texas <unk>
bradley did an amazing job and i truly don't believe there's anybody who could have done better taya kyle chris kyle's widow told cnn's jake tapper
when her late husband's friends saw the movie they told her it's eerie how much it felt like chris
it's like the spirit of chris is <unk> from bradley as he's playing this role
so put it all together a <unk> star a respected director a compelling true story strong marketing and some excellent timing and you get a surprise blockbuster that's not likely to be <unk> anytime soon
but of course hollywood will try
while there have also been largely peaceful protests authorities from africa to the middle east are seeing clashes in the streets and seeking ways to tamp down the uproar among muslims furious over depictions of the prophet mohammed

swiss pilots bertrand piccard and andre borschberg announced the solar impulse two aircraft will depart the united arab emirates on their historic adventure in late february or early march making a total of twelve planned stops
the route includes landings in myanmar
china
india
phoenix arizona
and new york's john f. kennedy international airport
at speeds between fifty and one hundred kilometers per hour piccard and borschberg aim to circle the globe flying about twenty five days over a total of about five months
an earlier version of the plane was the first solar powered aircraft of perpetual endurance to fly day and night without a drop of fuel according to its website thanks to advanced solar cells that charge light weight lithium batteries
the batteries are able to store enough energy to allow the plane to fly long distances at night
developers say solar impulse two takes what engineers learned from its predecessor and pushes it a step further
compare the aircraft's wingspan to a giant boeing seven hundred and forty seven eight
solar impulse two is twelve feet wider at two hundred and thirty six feet
and it's very lightweight just two tons lighter than a large suv
with just one seat designers acknowledge solar impulse two isn't commercially practical
but that's not the point
instead engineers aim to demonstrate the possibilities of solar powered aviation and to promote clean energy technology
soon the plane's unique <unk> may be visible across the horizons of southern europe africa asia and north america
cities on the planned route include the chinese communities of chongqing and nanjing as well as <unk> and <unk> in india
the pilots have already set a few solar aviation records
in two thousand and ten with borschberg in the cockpit a previous solar impulse became the first manned plane to fly for twenty four hours on nothing but solar powered batteries
the team followed that up in two thousand and twelve when the plane flew from spain to morocco making it the first manned sun powered plane to fly to another continent
and in two thousand and thirteen piccard and borschberg flew an earlier version of solar impulse on a mission across the united states
piccard is a bona fide adventurer with world records to prove it
decades after pioneering ultralight aircraft in the one thousand nine hundred and seventy s piccard and his colleague brian jones were the first to circle the earth nonstop in a balloon in one thousand nine hundred and ninety nine
their gondola is displayed at the smithsonian
breaking barriers is a piccard family tradition
his grandfather explored the stratosphere in a pressurized chamber carried by a balloon
ten miles high he was the first human to see the curvature of the planet with his own eyes
<unk> father <unk> the pacific taking a special submarine to a record setting depth of nearly seven miles
borschberg came to the project with more than two decades as a swiss air force fighter pilot
further procedures in this case will be made by the court in krakow the regional prosecutor's office in krakow said in a statement tuesday
<unk> <unk> a spokesman for the prosecutor said the court could take several weeks to reach a decision
u.s. officials have repeatedly tried to bring polanski back to the united states to face sentencing in the decades old case
polanski pleaded guilty in one thousand nine hundred and seventy seven in california to having unlawful sex with samantha <unk> who was thirteen
polanski was forty three at the time
he fled to europe before he was sentenced
<unk> publicly <unk> polanski in one thousand nine hundred and ninety seven and has called for the case to be dismissed
the director of the <unk> has both french and polish citizenship and he has said he intends to film a movie in poland his parents homeland this spring
tuesday's move by the krakow prosecutor comes three months after polish authorities having received a request from u.s. officials to arrest polanski questioned the director but allowed him to leave after the interview
at the time a spokesman for the polish prosecutor general's office said that authorities there didn't believe it was necessary to hold him while the united states sought to extradite him
u.s. attempts to extradite polanski led to his arrest in switzerland in two thousand and nine
but the swiss ultimately rejected the american extradition request in two thousand and ten
switzerland let him go because the united states did not supply all the legal records switzerland requested and because polanski had a reasonable right to think he would not be arrested if he visited the country justice minister <unk> <unk> <unk> said at the time
besides an oscar win for the <unk> polanski also received academy award nominations for <unk> and <unk>

despite the millions earned in major league baseball the minor leagues are filled with players only <unk> around one thousand dollar a month as they chase a dwindling dream of making it big
it's a <unk> salary so low that it has sparked a class act lawsuit against major teams
read
mlb must finally answer for exploitation in the minor leagues
but one man thinks another way out is for minor <unk> to take their professional skills and switch them to another ball game
<unk> fountain the former <unk> coach for pakistan's test <unk> who also played baseball for great britain is recruiting american players to a scheme he calls switch hit twenty aimed at taking the inherent <unk> and <unk> of <unk> and training them in the nuances of twenty twenty cricket
i'm not trying to take players away from a baseball career says fountain who had <unk> with the royals the white sox and the <unk> before coaching some of <unk> top international teams using skills learned in the ballpark
but any current minor <unk> who feel they aren't going to make it or guys who have recently been cut or quit because they simply can not afford to carry on
they are perfect for a career in modern cricket
and the key things for these guys is that it pays considerably better than the gulf coast league
it's something he's already done once
after leaving his post with pakistan last year he converted a group of korean baseball players into a national cricket team that reached the quarterfinals of the asian games this fall
having moved back and forth between the two sports myself i know the potential these guys have for success in t twenty cricket says fountain
i was the first to introduce baseball <unk> techniques to international cricket because a major league <unk> will out throw a professional <unk> every time
this is a sport that americans can do well at
minor <unk> <unk> collins has been chasing the dream of the big leagues since he was a boy
his looks his build the way he talks and even his name are as near to the definition of an american <unk> as you're going to get
but beyond the square jaw and the all state honors as both <unk> and quarterback there's one thing that makes him different to every other guy out there on the diamond
he wants to be the greatest cricket player the world has ever seen
thomas collins iii got the nickname <unk> thanks to the <unk> crashing past the texas hospital where he was born in june one thousand nine hundred and eighty nine
a couple of decades later and <unk> hundred and seventy four <unk> average with thirteen home runs in sixty junior year games at dallas baptist saw him eventually signed by the blue <unk>
his story since then is <unk> similar to thousands like him <unk> in the minor leagues on a poverty line salary of one thousand two hundred dollar a month
i'm always an <unk>
i'm twenty five years old
this year will probably prove a lot
i want to make the big leagues and i'm going to work my butt off until it happens or doesn't happen collins said in his break between working an eight hour milk delivery shift and a full afternoon of <unk> training
collins is one of the first <unk> to switch hit twenty and talks with surprising enthusiasm about a sport he has only seen on youtube links sent to him by fountain
<unk> revolution eleven years ago into twenty twenty or t twenty with games taking three hours instead of five days has seen sleepy spectators replaced with raucous crowds <unk> swinging for the fences instead of blocking balls <unk> on the sidelines and the creation of new competitions
the annual indian premier league for instance awards the best players seven figure contracts for a season lasting just eight weeks
collins hopes it can save him from three point four five am <unk> calls and the end of his athletic career but believes he has something to contribute as well
i've always wanted to do something to change the world something that i can put my stamp on he says
jackie robinson did it for african americans in baseball
we can do it for americans in cricket
the <unk> that americans can bring to the table could revolutionize the game of cricket even more to become a bigger faster stronger sport
look at soccer now
that all came from american players making a stand in what was a minority sport over here
if you would've said soccer about five years ago people would've said get outta here man
now everyone's watching the world cup
another player hoping to break the mold is middle <unk> jordan dean a twenty four year old drafted by the tigers in two thousand and twelve but now with illinois independents the <unk> boomers and studying for an <unk> as a plan b
a lot of us guys in the minor leagues have to take the decision are my legs going to hold up or my bank account and which is going to go first
dean says
in my case it'll be the bank account because i know that otherwise i'll never be ready to finish playing ball
i've talked to my girlfriend about the cricket thing
we'd go through about five or ten minutes thinking how amazing it would be traveling the world playing sport
then it would be what the hell am i saying
it's ping pong in my brain
for fountain the <unk> goes beyond getting his players a t twenty contract
i want to inject enough talent into usa cricket to see it bounce back up the rankings
i want to coach a usa team at a world cup
a team already exists but he believes replacing its largely ex pat spine with american baseball talent is the only way it can join the elite
wearing a jersey with the flag on the front and your name on the back is huge for any american says dean
but fountain has also let his early sign ups know that there are a few things to iron out before he can start printing <unk>
i'm aiming for <unk> in the spring so the guys who are already with teams or trying out for teams can also come and try out for me says fountain
sponsorship is crucial
we're in talks with some interested parties but even if companies like <unk> can lay on some tickets to get these players to the <unk> that would help
i've wanted to do this for years i talked to some tv companies about a reality tv show back in two thousand and ten and i hope it could still be a part of it
<unk> <unk> twenty three was another earning in the region of fourteen thousand dollar a year with a blue <unk> affiliate before they let him go this past season
i think if we all started playing cricket i don't think the expectation would be that we're going to be stars and make millions he says
it would just be great to be the first to bring it out to america
then see where it goes after that
if the project stalls <unk> collins is prepared to go it alone
the whole thing with me is that whatever happens i still want to go overseas and try because i have got that excitement so high he says
i still want to go and train with <unk> to try it out myself
if we can work out a living situation with food i would do it in a heartbeat
i don't have to have some sort of income just as long as me and my wife have food and a place to stay
i know that i'm not going to be the best in the world in the first five years of playing the sport
but i'm also never going to go in and say i'll just be ok
i'm going to go and try and be the best cricket player in the world
fountain says it will take less time than collins thinks
these guys have the potential to take the world of t twenty cricket by storm he said
for the last few years you have heard cricket <unk> use the phrase that was a real baseball shot
well now you will be able to see those so called baseball shots executed by guys who really can hit a ball four hundred feet with a bat whose hitting area is a fraction of the width of a cricket bat
in the movie field of dreams kevin <unk> plays ray <unk> a man who listens to a voice inside his head
the voice tells ray to <unk> under his sole source of income his iowa <unk> and build a baseball diamond for the ghosts of long dead chicago black sox stars to come play in
the voice in his head says don't test out the idea don't talk to anyone to see if it'll work just build it and they will come
<unk> builds the field the ghosts of the players arrive and he's <unk>
that's how it works in the movies
in reality of course it doesn't work that way
just because you can build something doesn't mean you should
even if you cook up something cool and new and make it available real people may still not want it
google seems to have stumbled on that simple fact last week
the tech world was surprised by an announcement that on january nineteen google glass will be withdrawn from the marketplace
sales didn't catch fire
apparently people didn't have much use for it
google may have needed to stop and listen to the needs and emotions of people in the everyday world of consumers
good things certainly <unk> from google glass
a mainstream conversation started about wearable tech taking it out of the lab and <unk> it into the <unk> of consumers
by pushing its agenda into this area google will help open the floodgates of products that deliver the promise of the internet of things
google glass is a demonstration of what gives american business an edge
this kind of applied technology that creates leaps into a whole new category of products and economic territory is the essence of american competitiveness
but google's fast retreat <unk> the most fundamental sin that companies make with the build it and they will come approach
it's a process that tech companies rely on referred to as public beta testing
but in one sense it treats consumers like guinea pigs
a company such as google <unk> a test product such as google glass throws it into the marketplace and asks people to actually pay for the privilege of beta testing their unfinished <unk>
companies are so focused on the mousetrap like google glass they tend to lose touch with the emotions and needs of the people they actually work for
consumers
<unk> <unk> head of google glass development at google x research labs admitted as much
the team looked inside google to the technology they could produce to make google glass and they didn't fully understand what value google glass would play in people's lives
there are other clues that google had little advance interest in their consumers real feelings about the value of smart <unk> technology
before launch google didn't anticipate that few would want to pay one thousand five hundred dollar to parade in public with a device <unk> around their eyes that others might perceive as either a threat to others privacy or a <unk> geeky gadget
google designated early adopters as explorers but the outside world didn't quite see them that way
glasshole was the word people invented to describe google glass wearers
they were thrown out of bars and banned from movie theaters because of privacy and intellectual property concerns
google glass showed yet again that silicon valley's idea of fashion has precious little to do with the tastes of the rest of the world
google <unk> were taken aback
they'd never anticipated rejection
sebastian <unk> a key <unk> on the google glass team was shocked by the glasshole label and surprised that for his <unk> wife and family it was much less desirable for me to wear it than i initially thought
is that tone deaf
maybe
but more than anything google spent its time looking inward at how to make a product that would fit their business agenda of capturing more personal data rather than looking outward
that was a critical mistake
feelings and emotions that consumers bring to a product are the <unk> of the consumer demand engine the demand drivers of why someone wants a product to begin with
those drivers were there to be discovered and applied to the google glass product development process and none of those are connected to the company's ultimate goal of having people hand over yet more data to google
privacy for example is known as a big issue in wearable tech
consumer confidence in the security of digital channels is low
there is not one mode through which a majority of americans are very secure sharing private information
how google protects information through product design helps determine whether a person will be interested in buying their product
google more than any company is familiar with this tricky relationship between technology and privacy
yet it designed a product that raised but didn't acknowledge and address these concerns
google seems to have also missed that fashion is personal and that is no less true in wearable tech
any wearable tech that <unk> the wearer or worse threatens others as google glass did is likely to find limited demand
google is moving to fix the basic issues that dogged google glass by making product improvements utilizing eyewear expertise including a leader with fashion experience and taking advantage of a big gun for strategic guidance tony fadell who brought the ipod and nest to market
we'll find out if the new team <unk> the core reason google glass failed
the company wasn't accountable to its consumers
one can hope that in the next google glass round and for other google moon shots still <unk> in the google x lab the company's engineers will gaze outside their lab to build a field of dreams for the people intended to play there

since the attacks security officials have been scrambling to trace her movements
but on january two a week before her name was internationally known security camera footage shows that boumeddiene and a male companion cleared customs with ease at <unk> secondary airport
something raised a red flag with turkish authorities however and the two were placed under surveillance
they checked into the <unk> hotel on the asian side of istanbul
they were monitored for a couple of days but after engaging in what was described as <unk> activities the surveillance stopped
following the paris attacks <unk> officials alerted french authorities that they had already gathered some intelligence on boumeddiene
the french provided the <unk> with phone numbers that allowed them further to track her movements
<unk> last known location is the city of <unk> along the turkey syria border
<unk> has become a key hub for transit into syria
the <unk> city has seen its population swell due to the influx of refugees from syria's civil war and just about anyone can blend into the chaotic streets
from here those seeking to enter syria can find plenty of routes for the next leg of their journey
cnn spoke to two men in a town close to the border both of whom are professional people smugglers
over the last few months the turkish military has really cracked down on the practice one said his head wrapped in a scarf to hide his identity
but there are always security breaches and alternate routes to be exploited
the second man his face obscured by a black cloth told cnn that a woman dressed all in black paid him some two to three times the going rate to get into syria right around when turkish authorities believe boumeddiene slipped into the country
she said i will give you one hundred <unk> just get me to syria he recalled
she was entirely covered in black like i am now
it was the first time since the war in syria began in two thousand and eleven that either of them had taken a woman across on her own
the <unk> said the woman was of medium build and guessed her age to be like boumeddiene in her mid twenty s. she spoke classical arabic and did not have a syrian accent
that he claimed is all he knows
i saw the one hundred <unk> and i did not ask anything he told cnn
what the woman paid is roughly forty two dollar
on the back of a <unk> they headed down a dusty border road dotted with potential illegal crossing points
the turkish military stopped the cnn team before it could reach the area where the man said the woman crossed into syria
there is no way of knowing if she was boumeddiene
but within an hour of her transaction with the <unk> the woman covered in black was in syria

in one thousand nine hundred and seventy five when mozambique became its own country following a decade long <unk> against portugal the land was covered in debris and was very much a blank canvas
for <unk> artwork proved the perfect medium to inform the public
at the time it was necessary to teach the people what's going on
what is independence
what is mozambique
it was necessary to teach people and people didn't read so we taught through paintings in the road he says referring to the low literacy rate back then
like <unk> <unk> work has achieved international acclaim following an exhibit at the united nation's headquarters in one thousand nine hundred and ninety six
since he's been shown in countries throughout the world
it is a narrative that is becoming popular in the country which has started to gain a reputation as an incubator of fine arts
there is an artistic movement confirms <unk> <unk> president of <unk> <unk> di <unk> a longstanding exhibition space that <unk> many of the country's up and coming artists
the president has no control minister of information nadia sakkaf told cnn as clashes raged
president abdu rabu mansour hadi was thought to be in his private residence at the time not in the palace
there were reports of clashes near the residence
and the prime minister's residence was under attack from the street sakkaf said
the regime still controlled the city of aden and it closed the port of aden as well as roads leading into and out of sanaa according to yemeni state tv which is controlled by the government
the global stakes are high
yemen is home to al qaeda in the arabian peninsula or aqap the terror network linked to such attacks as the recent slaughter at french satirical publication charlie hebdo
aqap also tried to blow up a plane landing in detroit in two thousand and nine
the battle against aqap has helped make yemen's government a u.s. ally in the fight against al qaeda
a power vacuum often benefits terrorist groups
the yemeni government has been grappling with pressure not only from the sunni muslim aqap but also from houthi militants shiite muslims who have long felt marginalized in the majority sunni country
seven things to know about yemen
we are the victims of corruption and false promises houthi rebel leader abdul malik al houthi said in a televised address on a network controlled by houthis and based in beirut lebanon
the government did not respect the peace and partnership deal from september
we are trying to bring some legitimacy to the government
he complained of economic struggles and poverty
al houthi also said there is an international conspiracy to link yemen to the attacks in paris
yemeni people have two options to move against the foreign agendas or stand against them firmly since they seek to spread chaos in yemen
this is why we moved with the yemeni people though many powers inside and outside yemen are angered
but the yemeni people are with us and understand our goals he said
aqap claimed responsibility for the charlie hebdo attack and u.s. investigators have worked on the assumption that attacker said kouachi met the late american terrorist cleric anwar al awlaki at some point in yemen and received orders from aqap a u.s. official told cnn
tuesday's developments came a day after heavy fighting between government forces and houthis left nine people dead and sixty seven others injured yemen's health ministry said before the sides agreed to a ceasefire
gunfire could be heard sporadically across sanaa on tuesday
unknown assailants fired shots monday night at a u.s. embassy vehicle in sanaa the u.s. embassy said tuesday
the shooters fired first into the air and then turned the guns on the vehicle the embassy said
the vehicle carried u.s. diplomatic personnel and was at a checkpoint near the embassy at the time
no injuries were reported
the embassy is known to use <unk> that are recognizable as u.s. government vehicles
two u.s. navy <unk> moved into new positions in the red sea late monday to be ready to evacuate americans from the embassy if needed a u.s. official with direct knowledge of the planning told cnn
u.n. secretary general ban ki moon called on all sides to immediately cease all hostilities exercise maximum restraint and take the necessary steps to restore full authority to the legitimate government institutions
members of the u.n. security council were briefed by the u.n. special adviser on yemen <unk> <unk> and later issued a statement expressing their concern about the crisis
they stressed that hadi is the country's legitimate authority
the members of the security council emphasized that all parties and political actors in yemen must stand with president hadi prime minister bahah and yemen's cabinet to keep the country on track to stability and security the statement read
houthis swept into the capital last year sparking battles that left more than three hundred dead in a month
in september they signed a ceasefire deal with the government and houthis have since installed themselves in key positions in the government and financial institutions
but tensions flared again last weekend as houthis said they abducted presidential chief of staff ahmed bin mubarak in sanaa on saturday
osama sari senior media adviser to the houthi movement in yemen said houthis detained bin mubarak because the president wanted to introduce a new constitution without the houthis approval
since the collapse of the soviet union the country's status as a travel destination has grown steadily with visitors drawn as much by the spectacular architecture and history of moscow and st. petersburg as by the people and rich culture
however recent events in ukraine and the crimean region have dealt a blow to this popularity and could spell further trouble for russia's tourism industry in two thousand and fifteen
ironically with the ruble taking a significant hit after the west slapped sanctions on moscow following the annexation of crimea and tensions in eastern ukraine there's seldom been a cheaper time to go for visitors from many countries
but will they go
and crucially should they
indications so far suggest that two thousand and fifteen will be another tough year for the russian tourism industry
in the past russia's biggest source of visitors has been former soviet states <unk> ukraine
ukraine is by far russia's largest foreign market
last year tourism from that country into russia plunged forty three percents says <unk> kennedy an analyst for the london based travel and tourism intelligence centre
it's a situation mirrored across other former eastern bloc countries
traditionally these visitors have traveled to russia by road which is a cheaper route than flying
but many roads to russia from eastern europe go through ukraine which were shut down because of the conflict
beyond the region tourism from germany the united kingdom and united states experienced the most significant drops trends kennedy says are likely to continue in coming years
the political situation between russia and the eu remains difficult which affects the economy of russia in a negative way says helen <unk> managing director of moscow based destination management company travel russia
needless to say that russia is currently not a popular destination to travel to for many countries there
russia's rail and river <unk> usually a strong draw for tourists have seen a decline in interest for two thousand and fifteen <unk>
according to <unk> <unk> director of sales and marketing for moscow based <unk> dream cruises bookings are down by up to forty percents partly due to a backlash against russia's recent actions
business from all western countries has been affected in one way or the other he says
whereas six months ago that drop down may have been mainly driven by safety concerns now they are mostly of a political and emotional nature
there are no major western travel <unk> warning against visiting russia beyond its border regions with ukraine and regions that have previously been beset by troubles such as north <unk> and chechnya
the uk foreign and commonwealth website notes on russia
most visits are trouble free
there's a more cautionary message from the u.s. state department which expresses concern about sporadic terrorist incidents crime harassment and demonstrations but there's no explicit warning to stay away
felix <unk> is the marketing manager for <unk> <unk> a german tour operator running the <unk> gold trans <unk> train between moscow and beijing
he says the crimean crisis initially failed to dent business when it broke out in march
since there were no travel warnings few people canceled
nevertheless only a few new bookings came in after april for the rest of the season two thousand and fourteen wasn't the best year but still it was better than our forecasts for two thousand and fifteen
<unk> says his company still plans to run its full schedule of trans <unk> trains even though advance bookings are already down thirty percents
<unk> lucas is the co owner of <unk> corporation a u.s. based company with long roots in russia
at this time last year lucas thought that two thousand and fourteen was looking to be a strong year for tourism to russia
while events in crimea didn't lead to cancellations of trips already booked there was a drop in future demand
she says those who pulled out did so because they were not thrilled with the notion of what was going on and they made their decisions based on that rather than personal security issues
another <unk> of falling demand is a <unk> of two thousand and fifteen tour departures by international operators
river cruise companies viking cruises and <unk> are cutting capacity while <unk> has pulled out of russia altogether
for <unk> president <unk> <unk> it's partly a matter of economics and partly a matter of emotion
i'm the first to admit that this is both a personal and a business decision he says
one of my concerns is what the economic situation will be in the future
if there's another conflict or if trade sanctions are being imposed we don't want to provide support to the regime
economic factors are also at play <unk> adds
with the rapid decline of the ruble it's extremely costly to bring in goods to russia he says
so we can not guarantee that we can import the quality of goods and employ the right people to provide our passengers with the level of luxury they are used to
business travel has also been hit although the news isn't all bad
despite the recent downturn asia is emerging as a potential growth market for russia in terms of both business and leisure travel
asian countries tend to be less sensitive to the politics says travel russia's helen <unk>
the same we hear from <unk>
as the number of europeans goes down the number of asians increases
as a result our focus will move from the west to the east
outside of former soviet states china is russia's largest and fastest growing international <unk> market
according to <unk> kennedy
out of the top <unk> countries china was the only one to increase last year
as a result russia's national tourist agency has been making a strategic switch from west to east in the last few months
in part it's doing so by making visas easier to obtain especially for chinese groups heading to crimea
those groups are needed to fill the empty rooms left by the decline of ukrainian <unk> who previously made up seventy percents of <unk> tourism market according to kennedy
fueled by marketing efforts easing of visa restrictions and by the increased buying power of the yuan versus the ruble business from china is expected to be up at least ten percents in two thousand and fifteen
if westerners do venture to russia this year they may discover that it's actually a good time to go
although viking cruises has dry docked a portion of its russian fleet richard <unk> senior vice president of marketing points out that two thousand and fifteen may actually be the best time to visit russia
it certainly won't be as crowded and prices are down due to shrinking demand and favorable exchange rates against the ruble
what many do not see in this context is that there couldn't be a better time to visit
people are <unk> than ever before the cost for restaurants theater visits <unk> yes even hotel <unk> are significantly lower plus
no <unk> at the st. petersburg hermitage
obama began his speech at nine ten p.m. in front of a joint session of the house and senate declaring that the shadow of crisis has passed and the state of the union is strong
at this moment with a growing economy shrinking deficits bustling industry and booming energy production we have risen from recession freer to write our own future than any other nation on earth he said
it's now up to us to choose who we want to be over the next fifteen years and for decades to come he said
will we accept an economy where only a few of us do <unk> well
or will we commit ourselves to an economy that generates rising incomes and chances for everyone who makes the effort
obama argued that a raft of new policy proposals which include an ambitious plan to raise taxes on wealthy americans and financial institutions to pay for progressive priorities favor the middle class and that middle class economics works
and he laid down the <unk> to republicans
they'll continue to work as long as politics don't get in the way
it's a defiant speech for the president now freed from the shackles of vulnerable red state democrats up for re election and looking to burnish his legacy in his final two years
instead of granting republicans their wish for a realistic <unk> in chief <unk> by a midterm election <unk> obama is attempting to set the terms of an economic debate that could continue into the two thousand and sixteen race to replace him in the oval office
he called for cooperation <unk> the theme that there isn't a red america or blue america from the two thousand and four democratic national convention speech that shot obama into stardom
and he flashed a renewed confidence going off script after touting the improving economy to say this is good news people and followed it with a <unk>
later when obama said he had no campaigns left to run and some republicans <unk> clapped the president shot back
i know cause i won both of them
at the heart of his message is a robin hood style plan to raise taxes on wealthy americans investments and financial institutions and use that money to foot the bill for free community college tuition and new tax credits for child care and two worker households
that proposal stands next to no chance of clearing congress
but along with campaign style events and interviews with youtube stars touting his initiatives both before and after the speech democrats hope obama's decision to play up the parties philosophical differences will remind republicans who now control both the house and the senate of the political force they couldn't overcome in two thousand and eight and two thousand and twelve
republicans though see a president in denial one who hasn't learned anything from the <unk> that cost his party the senate in november
whose veto threats and tax and spend proposals are a lame duck <unk> as his influence fades
the president's proposals are so out of touch you have to ask if there is any point to the speech republican national committee chairman reince priebus tweeted
freshman iowa sen. joni ernst delivered the gop's response calling on obama to cooperate with congressional leaders to advance new trade pacts and overhaul the tax code
but she also said now that her party controls both the house and the senate changes are coming and she hit obama's signature health care law while doing it
americans have been hurting but when we demanded solutions too often washington responded with the same stale mindset that led to failed policies like obamacare ernst said
it's a mindset that gave us political talking points not serious solutions
obama's two thousand and twelve republican opponent mitt romney who is considering a two thousand and sixteen run for the white house called the speech disappointing
romney said obama is more interested in politics than in leadership
more intent on winning elections than on winning progress he ignores the fact that the country has elected a congress that favors smaller government and lower taxes
but hillary clinton the leading two thousand and sixteen democratic contender praised obama's speech tweeting that the president pointed the way to an economy that works for all
now we need to step up and deliver for the middle class
gop's rebuttal
we heard the message you sent in november
but the white house is <unk> that with free trade and cybersecurity two potential areas for deals as the major exceptions there's little to be gained in trying to bargain with a congress already bent on forcing showdowns with obama on immigration the keystone xl pipeline cuba health care and more
they see an opening
the economy has improved the president's approval rating now tops fifty percents for the first time in years and free of the constraints he felt ahead of the midterm elections an emboldened obama is <unk> a series of executive actions to check item after item off his long stalled to do list
this could be his best shot at pivoting from an <unk> series of fiscal crises and legislative battles toward an economic debate that could set the tone for the last two years of his presidency and for a two thousand and sixteen race that had been about moving past him
taking top billing in tuesday night's speech is the tax and spend plan obama has rolled out in recent days
the benefits would largely go to students and young families
the child care tax credit would triple to three thousand dollar
households in which both spouses work could qualify for a new five hundred dollar credit
and college students and those <unk> loans could get breaks thanks to obama's plan to make two year community college degrees free
footing the bill are tax hikes on the rich
a total of three hundred and twenty billion dollar over ten years by targeting wealthy individuals and banks
paying most of the price would be couples earning more than five hundred thousand dollar who would see their capital gains rate jump from twenty three point eight percents to twenty eight percents
more inherited assets would be subject to capital gains taxes and top financial firms would face new fees
reality check on obama's state of the union proposals
obama is also making his own moves to give federal workers at least six weeks of paid maternity leave once their children are born and he's lobbying lawmakers to pass a bill allowing workers to earn up to seven paid sick days and pushing local governments to set up their own sick leave programs
before the speech republican congressional leaders made clear that obama's proposals are dead on arrival
it all looks like the same old tax and spend that the president has been advocating for the last six years senate majority leader mitch mcconnell said
he called obama's tax plan another income <unk> effort and said it won't help congress work on a comprehensive tax overhaul
hopefully that's just rhetoric mcconnell said
he knows we're not likely to pass these kinds of measures
and we'll still look for things that we can actually agree on to try and make some progress here
here are several other issues that have dominated the news in recent weeks and how obama addressed them in the prepared text of his speech
fighting isis
obama said that american leadership including our military power has played a key role in stopping isis and called on congress to authorize the use of military force against the group in iraq and syria
instead of getting dragged into another ground war in the middle east we are leading a broad coalition including arab nations to degrade and ultimately destroy this terrorist group
this effort will take time
it will require focus
but we will succeed he said
and tonight i call on this congress to show the world that we are united in this mission by passing a resolution to authorize the use of force against isil
cybersecurity
the president asked congress to approve legislation that would allow government and businesses to work together more closely to thwart online attacks a proposal that could win the support of the gop led congress
no foreign nation no hacker should be able to shut down our networks steal our trade secrets or invade the privacy of american families especially our kids obama said
we are making sure our government <unk> intelligence to combat cyber threats just as we have done to combat terrorism
and tonight i urge this congress to finally pass the legislation we need to better meet the evolving threat of cyber attacks combat identity theft and protect our children's information
cuba
perhaps the richest <unk> of the night is over obama's recent move to thaw the decades old economic and diplomatic freeze with the small island country
obama had invited alan gross the u.s. contractor whose release from a cuban prison he had secured in november
the president's top critic sen. marco rubio had asked cuban activist rosa mara pay to come as his guest
she's the daughter of oswaldo pay a pro democracy activist who was killed in a two thousand and twelve crash in which the car's driver has said it was deliberately targeted by cuban government officials
when what you're doing doesn't work for fifty years it's time to try something new obama said
our shift in cuba policy has the potential to end a legacy of mistrust in our hemisphere
removes a phony excuse for restrictions in cuba
stands up for democratic values
and extends the hand of friendship to the cuban people
and this year congress should begin the work of ending the embargo
iran
the white house had extended the deadline for its negotiations with iran to end the country's nuclear program but lawmakers have said they've run out of patience with the iranian regime and want to impose new sanctions
obama urged them to wait
there are no guarantees that negotiations will succeed and i keep all options on the table to prevent a nuclear iran
but new sanctions passed by this congress at this moment in time will all but guarantee that diplomacy fails alienating america from its allies
and ensuring that iran starts up its nuclear program again he said
it doesn't make sense
that is why i will veto any new sanctions bill that threatens to undo this progress
free trade
obama risked <unk> his own base by asking lawmakers to hand him authority to fast track pacific rim and european union trade deals through congress with limited debate and no amendments a power seen as crucial to <unk> those negotiations with foreign leaders
he posited the trade deals as an opportunity to combat china's growing influence in asia
why would we let that happen
we should write those rules
we should level the playing field
that's why i'm asking both parties to give me trade promotion authority to protect american workers with strong new trade deals from asia to europe that aren't just free but fair he said
and in a move to acknowledge liberal criticism obama said
look i'm the first one to admit that past trade deals haven't always lived up to the hype and that's why we've gone after countries that break the rules at our expense
but ninety five percents of the world's customers live outside our borders and we can't close ourselves off from those opportunities
more than half of manufacturing executives have said they're actively looking at bringing jobs back from china
let's give them one more reason to get it done
internet access
in an in the weeds regulatory proposal that could result in much faster internet access for many cities and states obama is calling on the federal communications commission to override nineteen states laws against <unk> setting up their own broadband infrastructure
i intend to protect a free and open internet extend its reach to every classroom and every community and help folks build the fastest networks so that the next generation of digital innovators and entrepreneurs have the platform to keep reshaping our world obama said
last friday's print edition of the sun was the last to feature a bare <unk> woman ending one of british <unk> most controversial traditions after forty five years according to the times the <unk> sister paper
the sun refused to confirm the report on tuesday
it's all speculation by people who don't work on the newspaper a spokesman told cnn
we regularly mix it up there's no hard and fast rule
despite the sun's denial the women featured on the third page of this week's <unk> have indeed covered up model <unk> huntington <unk> posing in <unk> on monday and <unk> clad soap opera stars <unk> on the beach on tuesday
an overhaul of the most infamous page in the country would be seen as the end of an era and a victory for critics who have derided page three as a sexist <unk> in a society that has moved on since one thousand nine hundred and seventy when rupert murdoch launched the feature shortly after purchasing the paper
stephanie <unk> a twenty year old german <unk> was the first to strip off for the paper in november one thousand nine hundred and seventy
page three quickly became an institution and page three girl entered the british vernacular
the topless pics were credited by some for giving a boost to the sun's circulation figures as well as launching the careers of a number of glamor models over the years including melinda messenger samantha fox and katie price
but murdoch had come under increasing pressure since two thousand and twelve when the no more page three campaign whose slogan is <unk> aren't news demanded that the sun's editors kill the page
the group's online petition has attracted more than two hundred and seventeen thousand signatures since its launch
murdoch the media tycoon who also owns twenty one st century fox seemed to indicate that change could be on the way when he branded page three old fashioned in a tweet last september
a spokeswoman for no more page three expressed delight about the rumors but said the sun needed to go even further
we're really pleased it's a definite step in the right direction laura ashton told cnn
it kind of depends a bit as well what they replace it with if it continues to be women in <unk> then it's still women being <unk> and we don't really think there's any place for that in a national newspaper so the campaign will continue
ashton also had her own idea for what page three could feature in the future
i'd love to see a celebration of women the sun's in a really unique position here where they could turn things around after forty five years of giving us sexist images
they could celebrate women in sport or some other way in which women contribute to society
no more page three was launched by lucy ann holmes in the summer of two thousand and twelve after the writer and actress noticed that the largest female image in the sun newspaper was of a young woman showing her breasts for men even though jessica ennis had won her tremendous gold medal in the london olympics
although topless shots may no longer grace the <unk> print edition the group's campaign is far from over
the tradition lives on at the sun's page three website and the daily star another british tabloid was still featuring naked models on page three as of tuesday
and at the golden <unk> recently hollywood declared its <unk> to attacks on liberty mocking north korea's kim jong un for trying to shut down the movie the interview and announcing its united front with france against terrorism
together we will stand united against anyone who would <unk> free speech said hollywood foreign press association president <unk> <unk>
george clooney talked about the millions who marched for unity in paris
they marched in support of the idea that we will not walk in fear
we won't do it
the tech world too has pledged its support of life and liberty in the wake of the sony hack and paris attacks
facebook ceo mark zuckerberg called for a rejection of extremists trying to silence the voices and opinions of everyone else around the world
google featured a black <unk> on its homepage and apple put a banner with the words je suis charlie on its french website
this is all very fine and good of course
the horrific slayings of french police officers french cartoonists and four jews at a grocery store should be the kind of shock to the system that brings even the most disparate of groups together and maybe even <unk> them out of the false sense of security that al qaeda's leadership ranks have been decimated or that islamic extremism can be thwarted by efforts at <unk>
many are united in horror but one only needs to look back at some recent examples of other horrifying atrocities to know that mere symbolism and solidarity what i call the weapons of soft outrage will not be enough to stamp out terrorism in europe or anywhere else
it's been eight months since boko haram militants kidnapped more than two hundred teenage girls in chibok nigeria and they are still missing despite u.s. first lady michelle obama's best efforts at soft outrage joining a twitter campaign to bringbackourgirls
even though it went viral and everyone from hillary clinton to british prime minister david cameron <unk> in hashtag activism hasn't proven very effective in the face of violent islamic extremism
last week reports that a <unk> inducing two thousand people were killed in nigeria once again shocked western audiences who then learned that most of the victims were reportedly children women and the elderly
the bbc estimates that boko haram now controls seventy percents of nigeria's borno state
in another corner of africa darfur remains a <unk> site of untold violence and genocide that has spanned ten years wiped out hundreds of thousands and displaced millions
last october there was reportedly a mass rape in the village of <unk> sudan as tribal fighting <unk> on
but this weekend the golden <unk> honored clooney with a lifetime achievement award for his work in film but also for raising awareness of <unk> plight
what has all that awareness accomplished
not much as the guardian recently learned
it asked people who have lived and worked in the region what happened to darfur after george clooney came to town
as one resident put it
clooney might be doing something fantastic tracking the movements of sudanese troops and militias but for me as a person living in darfur in touch with what is happening on daily basis i don't see that it has halted or even reduced the genocide
the killing displacement sexual assaults and rape never stopped
while awareness and solidarity aren't <unk> soft outrage is useless in stopping terrorism and genocide
these things often require force the kind of intervention that tends to make soft <unk> uncomfortable
if clooney for example truly cares about the people of darfur i would hope he <unk> that awareness alone will not end the genocide there only force will
hashtag diplomacy isn't an actual solution to a terrifying real problem
but military intervention to bring back our girls or stop the horrific atrocities in nigeria could well be
europe must accept that unity marches and inclusion rhetoric won't protect freedom of speech or religion against extremists determined to attack them
france has <unk> to attacking isis in iraq along with the u.s. but will it join in strikes against isis in syria or al qaeda terrorists in the arabian peninsula and elsewhere
silicon valley must accept that facebook posts and website banners won't prevent terrorists whether isis or actors like kim jong un from attacking western values and western infrastructure
will facebook google and apple support the necessary investments in our national defense that will help better protect our values and our companies
maybe you don't believe that the united states should involve itself politically or militarily in these conflicts around the world
that's a reasonable position even if i disagree with it
but let's not kid ourselves into thinking our soft outrage is either effective or noble
it's lovely to see all these folks stand with france
but standing isn't doing and the hard truth is that symbolism is no match for the fanatics who want us <unk>
are they ready to back up their rhetoric with action
vital signs is a monthly program bringing viewers health stories from around the world
it had moved from one side of the brain to the other
very few things move in the brain says dr. <unk> gkrania klotsas about a british man found to have a tapeworm moving inside his brain in two thousand and thirteen
this form of tapeworm had never been seen before in the united kingdom
the patient who was of chinese descent had recently visited china which along with south korea japan and thailand has more regular <unk> of the parasite known as spirometra <unk>
four years earlier the man had first experienced symptoms such as headaches which the team of doctors at <unk> hospital in cambridge had treated as tuberculosis
but then he returned
when he <unk> he had new symptoms says gkrania klotsas
the worm was now pushing on a new part of his brain causing seizures and weakness in his legs
the condition associated with his infection was in fact <unk>
there is no known drug to effectively treat the infection meaning that upon diagnosis doctors had to be quick to remove the worm surgically
read
are we closer to hiv vaccine
just three hundred infections of the spirometra tapeworm were recorded between one thousand nine hundred and fifty three and two thousand and thirteen but they're thought to be more common in parts of asia
the rural nature of more affected populations means numbers are widely unknown and very little is known about the worms
these worms are pretty mysterious says geneticist <unk> bennett from the wellcome trust <unk> institute in cambridge whose team recently sequenced the genome of the rare worm
we know it has a very complicated life cycle
the adult form of the spirometra tapeworm only occurs in the intestines of cats and dogs but as these animals shed the worms eggs in their feces the eggs can enter and <unk> water
the resulting juvenile form of tapeworm known as larvae can then stay in the water within certain small <unk> or end up in <unk> and snakes
as larvae they can invade humans through <unk> or direct contact with infected animals
the patient in cambridge was thought to have accidentally drunk water whilst swimming in an infected lake according to gkrania klotsas
the worm then took hold
the larvae can <unk> in the brain or somewhere else says bennett
the consequences of these cysts can be tissue damage blindness paralysis or even death
by sequencing the worm's genes bennett hoped to understand the inner workings of the worms to aid future diagnosis and treatment
because it's such a rare infection it's not economically viable to create a drug just for this worm she explains
but by comparing it to other tapeworms we can see which other drugs might apply
the team were given small samples of the worm extracted from the infected patient and their sequencing identified an exceptionally large genome and importantly genes which could help recognize resistance to drugs as well as act as future drug targets
you could also develop a diagnostic test adds bennett
there are many forms of tapeworm three of which can readily infect the brain
from a public health perspective there's one in particular to watch out for
it's mainly the pork tapeworm that's the main brain one says helena helmby from the london school of hygiene and tropical medicine
the pork species known as <unk> <unk> can infect humans in two forms
the first is by eating undercooked pork from infected pigs resulting in <unk> an adult worm residing in the intestine
the second in the larval form through contact with the feces of an infected pig or human which can go on to infect many tissues
if the larval worm enters the nervous system including the brain it can result in a condition known as neurocysticercosis
infection of this kind can often cause epilepsy once inside the brain
almost a third of epilepsy cases in countries where the disease is native are people who have previously had neurocysticercosis according to the world health organization
neurocysticercosis infection arises from poor sanitation and hygiene
you can actually infect yourself says helmby as poor hygiene such as failing to wash your hands could result in you eating the eggs of an adult worm living in your intestine
self infection is common
the global distribution of pork tapeworms is widespread with high numbers across latin america africa and asia according to the world health organization
as a result of its higher prevalence and due to increased international travel gkrania klotsas has three patients in her care in cambridge who have previously experienced neurocysticercosis
infections with pork tapeworms are common but treatable with <unk> drugs targeting the worm
until now treatment for spirometra has been surgical but the recent genetic insight from <unk> team in cambridge found that some drugs such as <unk> which is used against <unk> could have an effect
certain drugs used against cancer were also identified as potential treatments
both helmby and gkrania klotsas are concerned about risks from increased international travel and the global food trade
food import and export is increasing and increasing risks of consuming infected goods says helmby who feels there is a need for more vigilance with food inspection
she predicts more cases will occur in places like the united kingdom where such infections have been virtually eliminated
i'm confident there will be more of this in the future agrees gkrania klotsas who has seen patients infected without having traveled abroad
people are getting infections without going anywhere
those who do travel however also need greater awareness when visiting regions where infections are commonplace
but if health teams are ready for the consequences this rise can be controlled
we need to be able to treat these infections says helmby
that's the challenge at the moment
a challenge where genetics researchers could prove invaluable as their sequencing continues to reveal the secrets of these parasites

now i say i'm sure because i like the germany team
one of our followers in india wanted to know about <unk> favorite places
for traveling i like to go to germany
for tennis i always liked australia
this question on tennis friendships came from india
petra kvitova
i like her a lot
sometimes it's strange on the women's tour
some players never talk
my team and her team were pretty special
we just finished a match walking out of the court
both teams talk like friends
i like that friendship
it's not easy to find a good friend on the tour
i miss my fans as well
but the tennis
of course i miss it but i can not play
maybe wait another year to see how's the knee and then go back to the court
but not to play professionally
twitter follower <unk> was curious about how tennis had changed <unk> life
tennis is my life
i grew up with tennis and now everything i know is from tennis
also i meet friends from the tour
i learned a lot if you have a low ranking how people treat you and if you have a high ranking how people treat you
it's the same all over the world not only in tennis
<unk> wanted to know who li looked up to in her younger days
who is your role model
<unk> <unk> facebook
andre agassi
when i was young in china they didn't show much tennis
one day i turned on the television and i saw that tennis players can be like that
he had long hair <unk> with jeans
that was pretty special for me so i was like tennis players are so cool
<unk> international is a social enterprise training rural ghanaian communities in the art of bamboo bicycle manufacture to provide an economic freedom many of them have never experienced
we were looking at how we can engage the youth in the right areas into a meaningful venture says company founder and ceo <unk> danso who last year launched <unk> as a subsidiary enterprise of a development organization called <unk> project
i've been engaging them in the bamboo bicycle business
bicycles made from bamboo have been around for more than a century but demand has only increased in recent years in part due to the <unk> of the concept by renowned bicycle designer craig <unk> in one thousand nine hundred and ninety five
<unk> went on to form <unk> a <unk> company dedicated to increasing the <unk> of bamboo bicycles particularly in developing countries and today a number of companies across africa are seizing the opportunity to make use of this abundant natural resource to create a boom in <unk>
it's <unk> strength and environmental sustainability make bamboo a highly desirable material
we do bamboo bicycles bamboo bicycle stands and bicycle <unk> for now says danso and their biking portfolio includes road city and mountain bikes in both male and female versions
each bike is purely handmade
once you get your bike nobody else in the world has it
whilst there are bikes being crafted by other manufactures in ghana at the root of <unk> lies not only innovative design but a social conscience with climate change mitigation and rural poverty <unk> among their primary goals
danso takes his rural youth teams through the entire manufacturing process from the harvesting of bamboo through to the final assembly of bespoke bicycles to ensure they're equipped with a diverse skill set
some <unk> have had the pleasure of being trained by <unk> himself
we managed to get him to come down to train people says danso
danso knows the challenges of manufacturing in rural ghana well including low capital high production costs and unreliable electricity sources
sometimes you come to work for two days and there is no light danso says
that's a really big problem to manufacturing in africa
but despite such limitations he is determined for his bicycles to travel the globe
in the next five years we want to conquer the world he concludes
his wish is for boomers to become a resource not only for bicycles but also furniture household items and even houses made of bamboo
we want to make this place the point where you come and get everything from bamboo
but it wasn't a <unk> gun
it was <unk> caliber <unk> <unk>
and the nine month old boy didn't survive
authorities are trying to figure out what led to monday's shooting in <unk> in the northwest corner of missouri
at this point foul play is not suspected and it appears at this time that the shooting was accidental the <unk> county sheriff's office said
sheriff darren white told cnn affiliate <unk> that the baby was in a <unk> when his brother found the gun lying around a bed
when emergency crews arrived they found the infant had been shot in the head
the child was flown to children's mercy hospital in kansas city missouri where he was pronounced dead the station reported
authorities say the gun belongs to a relative but not the mother
police are investigating the <unk> ownership <unk> reported
the mother's other three children are with relatives according to the station
the sheriff said guns are rampant in the rural community
we are big supporters of firearms around here white told cnn affiliate <unk>
we have a lot of people that own weapons
they hunt
they target shoot
most people are very safe with them and this is one of those cases where everything went together in the wrong way
he added we got some guys that work here that have little kids of their own
this kind of hits home with them too
they take it personally
though they say the shooting was accidental authorities have not determined whether charges will be filed against any adult in the case
at least one nearby resident told <unk> she believes the shooting could have been easily prevented
you know just some gun safety could have come into play and would have maybe you know prevented the situation but it's just really sad altogether neighbor jessica <unk> said
according to project <unk> gun owners should lock unloaded weapons in a safe <unk> or cabinet inaccessible to children
gun locks should be used in addition to safe storage and ammunition should be locked away separately from any firearm
parents should also teach their children that if they find a gun in a house they should leave it where it is and tell an adult even if the weapon resembles a toy the advocacy group says
monday's incident is the latest in a series of high profile shootings involving children
among them a four year old girl killed her cousin also four in detroit while playing with a gun found under a bed last january a nine year old accidentally killed a shooting instructor in august while firing a <unk> gun at an arizona range and last month a two year old fatally shot his mother in an idaho walmart after finding a gun in her purse
the suspected key link between senior isis operatives in syria and the belgian terrorist cell belgian moroccan isis fighter abdelhamid abaaoud is still at large a senior belgian counterterrorism official said
abaaoud's last known location was believed to be greece the official said
from antwerp to aleppo and back
europe's nightmare
as belgium's search continues other european nations are also moving in on suspected islamist cells amid concerns heightened by the terror attacks in paris two weeks ago
here's a look at the latest developments
police in berlin <unk> and <unk> raided thirteen properties linked to suspected radical islamists overnight police in the german capital said tuesday
most of the action was directed at a group connected to a mosque in the district of berlin <unk>
the overnight raids are part of the investigation into two alleged islamists who were arrested friday identified as ismet d. and emin f. berlin police said
both of them are accused of providing logistical aid to isis
some two hundred police officers were involved in the raids at thirteen sites across three german states
those subject to the raids have not yet been accused of any crimes but had contact with ismet d. and emin f
there are no indications that the group was preparing attacks in germany
five belgian nationals have been charged with participation in a terrorist organization in connection with last week's raids federal prosecutor eric van der sypt said
the terror cell was on the brink of an attack and planned to target police officers he said
belgian counterterrorism agencies say they suspect that the ringleader of the cell is abaaoud the senior belgian counterterrorism official said
abaaoud is also known as abou omar <unk> and abou omar al <unk> the official said
according to guy van vlierden a reporter at the belgian newspaper hln who tracks belgian foreign fighters in syria for the blog <unk> abaaoud is a twenty seven year old from the molenbeek district of brussels who traveled to syria in january two thousand and fourteen and joined isis soon afterward
the two gunmen killed in one of the raids in the city of verviers are belgians of north african descent from the same brussels district
they were in phone contact with an isis ringleader in greece who belgian authorities believe was probably abaaoud
but belgian authorities have not ruled out the possibility that an algerian suspect arrested in greece over the weekend was the key link between the terror cell and isis
that thirty three year old suspect was wanted in belgium on charges of terrorist activity greek police said monday
belgium is requesting an extradition
one suspect survived the police raid in verviers named as marouane el bali
he was taken into custody and faces charges of participation in a terrorist organization and possession of explosives with intent to commit a criminal attack among other charges said his attorney didier de quevy
but de quevy said his client was not involved in any terrorism
he was just delivering shoes to a friend when he was caught in the wrong place at the wrong time
five men purportedly russians of <unk> origin were arrested in southern france overnight while planning an act of terrorism according to french media reports tuesday
a cache of explosives was found according to <unk> <unk> and other media outlets quoting police sources and the local prosecutor <unk> <unk>
cnn has not yet been able to confirm the reports
meanwhile the paris prosecutor's office said tuesday that four men arrested friday are being placed under criminal investigation in connection with the paris terror attacks
they are under investigation for association with a criminal terrorist organization with the objective of committing crimes against people
in addition one of those in custody will be under formal investigation for possession or transport of weapons linked to a terrorist enterprise
the four men ages twenty two twenty five twenty six and twenty eight will remain in custody
five other suspects held since friday were released monday night
investigators say dna found in a car used to transport jewish market attack gunman amedy coulibaly has been traced to a man who is already in custody in connection with the attacks according to a source familiar with the ongoing investigation
investigators are still looking for a person whose dna was found on a magazine for coulibaly's gun
coulibaly killed four hostages on january nine at a kosher grocery store in paris before police killed him
he's also believed to have killed a policewoman a day earlier
before the siege he had proclaimed his allegiance to the islamic state in iraq and syria or isis
new surveillance video obtained by cnn shows coulibaly and his partner hayat boumedienne outside a jewish institution in paris
the video was recorded at the end of august or beginning of september and stored on a security camera
a source familiar with the ongoing investigation into the paris attacks says the nature of the video makes it clear that the couple was carrying out surveillance of possible targets for several months before coulibaly launched his attack against the kosher supermarket
new york mayor bill de blasio visited the scene of the siege tuesday and he added flowers to a mound of <unk> candles and handwritten tributes to those killed
he voiced his solidarity with france as it <unk> terrorism and he met with representatives of the jewish community
the supermarket assault happened during three days of terror in paris that began with the january seven attack on offices of the charlie hebdo satirical newspaper by gunmen said and cherif kouachi
in all twelve people died in the charlie hebdo attack
the funeral for maintenance worker frederic boisseau the first person to be killed took place tuesday
al qaeda in the arabian peninsula al qaeda's yemen affiliate claimed responsibility for the charlie hebdo shootings
france's le monde newspaper suffered a different kind of attack on tuesday when its official twitter account was apparently hacked by the syrian electronic army a group of pro syrian regime hackers that has aggressively targeted major news organizations and activists
one post that appeared on the newspaper's twitter account said je ne suis pas charlie and decried attacks on syria
after the hacking of our account our teams have taken it back into our hands the newspaper's account said in another tweet about an hour later
we apologize for any fraudulent posts on our behalf

azarenka only played fifteen matches in two thousand and fourteen after last year's australian open thanks to injuries to both feet and a right knee
and unsurprisingly her ranking has tumbled from no
two to outside the top forty
twice a champion in melbourne the twenty five year old entered her first round encounter against <unk> stephens <unk>
stephens has also seen better days including in two thousand and thirteen when the pair met not in the first round but in the semifinals at the year's opening major
it was perhaps the most enticing first round tussle of the tournament but azarenka ensured the hype <unk> the actual match as she eased past the american whose tag of next big thing in women's tennis isn't yet <unk> six three six two in seventy five minutes
azarenka won't be in the shadows much longer if she can replicate tuesday's performance
from the beginning i started to be pretty focused and just maintained that intensity azarenka told reporters
so that was a good opportunity to just really at the beginning take my chances because she's the kind of player that likes to take her chances
there is a lot to build from here
indeed azarenka can take heart from her display but she knows she won't have much time to dwell on it since her second round foe is longtime <unk> and u.s. open finalist caroline wozniacki
the <unk> upended another young american taylor <unk> seven six six two
being an <unk> player it's not a surprise that i have a tough draw or tough opponents in the early round said azarenka
i just need to go through that
i accept the challenges
she was showing some great tennis in the end of last year
i know she's very dangerous
we always had some of tough matches
i would like to focus on myself and what i can do to build my game to prepare as best as i can and just compete
that's my key word for this tournament
compete
besides being former no
one players azarenka and wozniacki share another thing in common going through high profile splits last year
whereas wozniacki and golfer rory mcilroy broke up azarenka and artist <unk> went their separate ways
azarenka trails wozniacki four three in their head to heads although they've only played one full match since two thousand and ten a victory for the <unk> in cincinnati in two thousand and thirteen
it's going to be tough wozniacki said
she's won here before
not the easiest on paper
but at the same time i'm just going to focus on myself my own game
honestly whether you have to beat her in the second round or fourth round whatever doesn't matter if you want to win the tournament
women's top seed serena williams began with a six zero six four win over belgium's alison van <unk> escaping a zero thirty hole on serve at four four in the second set and <unk> wimbledon champion petra kvitova eliminated dutch qualifier <unk> <unk> six one six four
kvitova was relieved since she fell to an outsider in the first round last year
i'm glad that i did better than last year kvitova told reporters
of course i mean the nerves were there
during all match i was still feeling the <unk> and the legs were suddenly so heavy and i couldn't really move
it was difficult but i'm glad i did it
that's important
on paper world no
one novak djokovic and defending champion stan wawrinka are due to meet in the semifinals and both began with three set wins
wawrinka who stunned djokovic last year on the way to opening his grand slam account routed turkey's <unk> <unk> six one six four six two while djokovic defeated <unk> <unk> <unk> a runner up to wawrinka in <unk> this month six three six two six four after a slow start
i was happy to be back on the court wawrinka told reporters
i can feel that i have a lot of support here and it's always nice to come back like that and to feel the crowd behind you
for sure it's great but it's still the beginning of the tournament
first round
it's just one match now i need to be ready for the next one
u.s. open finalist kei nishikori meanwhile downed two thousand and thirteen <unk> nicolas <unk> of spain six four seven six six two
<unk> whose ranking has plummeted from the top fifteen because of foot and shoulder injuries hit fifty unforced errors
home fans had plenty of reason to cheer monday after the likes of <unk> <unk> nick kyrgios bernard <unk> and <unk> <unk> won and tuesday brought more success
australia's top ranked player samantha <unk> who has struggled at the australian open beat <unk> monica <unk> six four six one with <unk> hewitt getting the better of china's zhang <unk> six three one six six zero six four
hewitt thirty three set a tournament record when he stepped on court making his nineteen th straight appearance
he continues to play tennis in the aftermath of several serious injuries
the else being that the pair will meet the same gruesome fate as other captives held by the terrorist group others who were shown in isis videos kneeling in orange <unk> in front of masked black clad men just like the japanese hostages identified as kenji goto jogo and haruna yukawa shortly before being beheaded
in the latest video a masked man gives the japanese government a choice to pay two hundred million dollar the same amount of money prime minister shinzo abe recently pledged for those contending with isis to free the japanese men
that deal holds for seventy two hours which would seem to mean sometime friday since the video appeared on social media tuesday
another move that theoretically could change things would be if japan's government <unk> its alliance with those fighting isis which calls itself the islamic state
tokyo hasn't participated in airstrikes aimed at the islamist extremist group though its leaders have supported those who have as well as the iraqi government
although you are more than eight thousand five hundred kilometers away from the islamic state you willingly volunteered to take part in this crusade the masked man on the video posted tuesday says addressing his comments to abe
but abe who is visiting the middle east didn't seem about to bargain tuesday
he stood by a pledge made in a speech at the weekend in cairo for funding to help build human capacities infrastructure and so on for those affected by isis armed campaign
the pledge aid is very important to the refugees in need and has nothing to do with the islamic communities or the radical militants the prime minister said
we will contribute to the peace and stability in cooperation with the global community
as to the isis threat against two of his nation's citizens abe called it unacceptable
i feel angry about it he said
i strongly urge them to immediately release the hostages without harming them
isis has asked for ransoms before and apparently has been paid them
but rarely are such demands made publicly
even <unk> unprecedented in fact is when the militant group puts its captives on video and threatens them then lets them go
instead isis has made a public show out of its threatening and killings of western hostages starting with <unk> beheading of u.s. journalist james foley
others killings were similarly recorded and posted online including american journalist steven sotloff british aid worker david haines british taxi driver alan henning and u.s. aid worker peter kassig
while not participating in ground combat both the united states and great britain have taken an active role in the anti isis fight with airstrikes and training arming and otherwise supporting groups such as iraq's military kurdish fighters and moderate syrian opposition taking on the militants face to face
that's not the case for japan whose post world war ii constitution allows it to use its military only for self defense
but tokyo is a strong ally with western powers such as the united states that have been singled out by isis
in his remarks tuesday in jerusalem abe who dealt with another hostage crisis involving islamic militants in january two thousand and thirteen when ten japanese citizens were caught up in the terrorist seizure of a natural gas facility in algeria said he had ordered japanese officials to do the utmost to try to save the two men
at the same time the prime minister added terrorists should not be forgiven for any reason
i criticize emphatically
the aim is to safely bring home two men who were in the same war torn region for very different reasons
like foley and sotloff goto went there to help tell the story of what was happening in iraq and syria
in recent months isis militants have managed to take over vast swaths of both countries <unk> going after many in their way who don't share their extremist interpretation of islam
the isis video refers to him as kenji goto jogo but on his twitter handle and a photograph accredited to him he's just called kenji goto
the freelance journalist reported for various japanese news organizations about the situation in the northern syrian battleground city of kobani which for weeks has been under siege by isis and other areas
while it's not known when he was taken captive goto's last twitter post was on october twenty three
the man purportedly shown along with him yukawa is believed to have been captured in syria in august while traveling with rebel fighters according to the japanese news agency <unk>
the forty two year old claimed to have set up a company in tokyo providing armed security services and posted videos online of his activities in iraq and syria
but a report by the news agency reuters in august portrayed him as a lost soul who went to the middle east searching for a purpose after losing his wife his business and his home over the previous decade
<unk> reported previously that japanese officials in jordan had being trying to secure his release including talking to various groups with possible connections to his captors
abe spoke firmly tuesday against the terrorists and their two hundred million dollar ransom demand
what he did not do however is rule out the japanese government paying ransom or negotiating with its two citizens captors
like most countries japan has never advertised that it or japanese companies have paid ransom for hostages
in fact japanese government officials have at times denied such a practice and japan is a <unk> to a two thousand and thirteen g eight <unk> that stated we unequivocally reject the payment of ransoms to terrorists and we call on countries and companies around the world to follow our lead to stamp this out
one reason for this policy is that isis and groups like it can use ransoms to fund their bloody campaigns
paying ransoms also may give them incentive to take more hostages thus putting more people at risk
and ransoms might not always work since isis and other hostage takers aren't usually seen as trustworthy
still ruling out ransoms also rules out one peaceful way to free goto and yukawa
it's possible someone else may intervene to negotiate their release whether out of goodwill or in exchange for something else
or troops from a japanese ally could launch a raid to get to them like the unsuccessful one this summer to free foley
either way others could play a role in this story before it's done hence abe's comment tuesday that the international community needs to deal with terrorists without giving in to them
where fashion meets politics
indian prime minister narendra modi is often seen wearing hats or traditional <unk> representative of each indian state during nation wide visits

the man was preparing to test for leaks inside the ten meter high tank on monday morning local time when he fell according to a statement from the tokyo electric power company

the president tackles this perennial <unk> by proposing that the tax code be changed in two very distinct directions
provide extra money to low and middle income families in the form of tax credits for children and working couples
raise taxes on upper income taxpayers especially the <unk> one percent through various <unk> and increased restrictions on savings
it is certainly easy to dismiss his suggestions given the makeup of the new congress which is controlled by republicans but stranger <unk> have been enacted when major tax <unk> are undertaken
so what does the president suggest
first he wants to triple child care tax credits for children under age five thereby <unk> an existing provision that republicans and conservatives have generally championed to make the tax system more family friendly
second he proposes a five hundred dollar tax credit for married couples when both spouses are employed an idea that essentially <unk> a provision that was enacted during president ronald reagan's first year
the majority party in congress may not be particularly <unk> with president obama's caveat that this credit phase out when a family's annual income reaches one hundred and twenty thousand dollar but such parameters can be negotiated as legislation gets developed
the tax changes on upper income taxpayers are more likely to generate partisan resistance
as a general matter republicans want to lower or even eliminate taxes on capital gains and this position has been party dogma since the first bush administration
in contrast president obama proposes to raise taxes on capital gains received by married couples with incomes exceeding five hundred thousand dollar per year
that income level may be above most people's conception of middle class but it is far below what it takes to be a one <unk>
nevertheless if one wants to address anomalies like warren buffett and mitt romney paying lower effective tax rates than their employees then raising tax rates on capital gains is a necessity
but president obama goes much further and attacks the so called step up in basis rule which the white house calls the trust fund loophole that allows gains on inherited property to go untaxed regardless of amount
targeting this longstanding tax rule takes aim not at those who have worked hard to create businesses and build wealth but at those whose pathway to riches was having the right relatives
obama's proposal in other words seeks to reduce wealth disparities without <unk> the job creators among us
along these lines he also proposes that no tax be due on inherited family operated businesses until they are sold
that said this proposal is no slam dunk
as recent battles over the estate tax have demonstrated americans do not particularly like the federal government claiming to level the <unk> playing field by <unk> family wealth
surveys repeatedly show that resentment of the rich is simply not as strong as some politicians seem to believe
in any case the step up in basis rule was effectively repealed in one thousand nine hundred and seventy six but congress then responded to the ensuing backlash by reversing this repeal retroactively
nearly two decades later an effort very similar to president obama's proposal was put forth during president clinton's first few months in office but the response then was also swift and negative
will this time be different
perhaps the sense among some citizens that the system is rigged will produce a different result this year but income inequality is fundamentally not a problem that is exclusively or even primarily about taxation
causes range from globalization and unfair trade agreements to falling educational achievement and the decline of private sector labor unions among others
tweaking the tax code even in the substantial and perhaps radical ways that president obama is due to propose on tuesday can go only so far in addressing this issue
on the other hand the u.s. tax code is one part of the puzzle that the federal government can control and do something about in fairly short order
tackling tax reform more broadly could be a pathway to bipartisan cooperation that creates a genuine achievement for both president obama and the new congress
in that context repealing the step up in basis rule and perhaps <unk> tax rates on capital gains and regular income would go a long way to simplifying tax planning and return preparation while allowing the market to allocate capital without the often <unk> preferences embedded in the current tax code
that is certainly a worthy project
but it is a very different focus than trying to <unk> income inequality
regarding the latter even if president obama's tax proposals are enacted exactly as he set out they may not do much about income inequality in the united states but they at least do more than just talk about it
the children along with teachers and activists were demonstrating after the playground was walled off during the holidays said <unk> mwangi who participated in the protest

liu and fellow officer rafael ramos were gunned down in their patrol car last month
it struck me that king's vision was both the empowerment of african americans the insistence on civil rights but also the reconciliation of people who seemed so hard to <unk> artist barry <unk> said

a facebook friend of mine promptly <unk> in a post <unk> as to how the new england patriots could come under investigation by the national football league for <unk> any of the balls used in sunday's conference championship game versus the indianapolis colts
a fair question about an unfair tactic to be sure
ok under further review let us take a look at this weird wild <unk> you got ta be kidding me controversy that has <unk> blown up unexpectedly
it became the talk of talk radio monday
and you could picture every staff writer employed by <unk> fallon <unk> and others tapping <unk> on their laptops coming up with joke after joke
it was confirmed by an nfl official that the league was looking into the pretty <unk> possibility that balls used in new england's easy forty five seven victory at gillette stadium were not adequately inflated
yep people actually now wonder whether you can get an extra edge from gillette
patriots superstar quarterback tom brady had the question put to him monday on a radio interview and called it ridiculous saying i think i've heard it all
the idea <unk> as it is would be that a football would be considerably easier to catch and grip if it were filled with slightly less air than usual
particularly in wet chilly weather like that found on a january evening in massachusetts
five things to know for the super bowl
to the <unk> question as to the teams using exactly the same ball i.e
so where's the advantage
each nfl team according to rule two section two of league <unk> will make twelve primary balls available for testing by the referee two hours and fifteen minutes prior to the starting time of the game
the home team will also make twelve backup balls available for testing
eight other balls sealed in a box by the manufacturer are marked by the referee and used exclusively for the kicking game
i don't know if an actual scale is used like a jockey or a boxer making weight but a football is supposed to weigh between fourteen and fifteen ounces
if there are weight loss programs for overweight footballs this would be the first i have heard of it
the biggest loser show on nbc could get a whole season out of something like this
naturally conspiracy <unk> could speculate that the patriots somehow <unk> a way into using a deflated ball themselves giving mr. brady a little help while making sure that the visiting team's quarterback andrew luck of the colts had to pass a football that was more tightly inflated than a <unk> thanksgiving day parade balloon
i have never heard of this accusation being made in all the years i have been following professional football
i mean come on
honey you didn't blow up the balls
how <unk> could a team be
however i did indeed have awareness of a similar situation occurring in college football as recently as two thousand and twelve
it involved the university of southern california a <unk> school my own daughter's <unk> <unk>
<unk> was fined twenty five thousand dollar by its conference for being caught doing exactly that messing with the air in the football
a student manager was responsible
the university said he did it on his own apparently without the knowledge of a single other human being in then coach lane <unk> football program <unk> no fewer than five footballs to be used in a <unk> game against oregon
three bad balls were discovered by officials before the game two more at halftime
the kid was later fired the university was fined and <unk> by the pac twelve conference and much the way tom brady put it monday a lot of us ended up saying
i've heard it all now
turned out that in college football schools provide their own footballs whereas in pro football the exact same eighteen balls are used by both teams
who knew
it is difficult not to laugh at the thought of bill belichick the generally <unk> head coach of the patriots <unk> some kind of <unk> dr
evil plot to <unk> a certain number of those footballs then having a co conspirator somehow sneak the soft balls into the game when new england it was on offense then the harder balls into the game when <unk> had it
<unk> <unk> <unk>
the <unk> belichick would laugh to himself
i <unk> them again
except what are the odds of something like this actually happening
i appreciate that the patriots have been so successful over the years that they have been accused of everything short of spying on their opponents from the hubble telescope
i personally believe the patriots win most of their games because they score more points than the other team does
they will be going to another super bowl this year the one coming up february one in <unk> arizona because the pats know how to play football not how to blow one up
even so their opponents the seattle seahawks had better come prepared
i suggest they bring a scale
the house belonged to technology executive don pyle the chief operating officer for <unk> company spokesman antonio <unk> said
pyle had not been heard from on monday and his colleagues at <unk> were hoping for a miracle cnn affiliate wjla reported
pyle was believed to have been at home with his wife and four grandchildren
when the first firefighters arrived on the scene they received conflicting reports about whether the family may have been out of town
but after interviews with relatives it has been determined that six members of the family are not accounted for the anne <unk> county fire department said
fire officials said they were alerted about three thirty a.m. monday to the fire in the sixteen thousand square foot house
about eighty firefighters responded
the bureau of alcohol tobacco firearms and explosives is assisting the local fire department and an <unk> national response team is being assembled because the fire was deemed suspicious a law enforcement official said
the burned out home is being treated as a crime scene until investigators figure out the cause the official said
the anne <unk> county fire department said fire crews had difficulty knocking down the blaze because the house is <unk> apparently with no fire <unk> on the scene
photos the fire department posted on twitter showed <unk> stretched for long distances
davies said it took several hours for fire department <unk> trucks and a fire boat on an adjacent creek to bring the fire under control he said
<unk> special agent dave <unk> said no one has searched for possible victims yet because of the size and heat of the fire
the foreign ministry in beijing responded monday to the publication by german magazine der spiegel of new documents purportedly from nsa leaker edward snowden
the ministry's spokesperson hong <unk> told reporters monday that he wondered if his country's <unk> could produce any evidence to support their claims
cyber attacks are hard to trace back and are usually committed across borders
this complexity means that it is extremely difficult to identify the source of the attacks
one document reveals that u.s. authorities believe china stole many terabytes of data related to its new state of the art f thirty five fighter jet including detailed engine <unk> and radar design
cnn has not been able to independently confirm the authenticity of the document
the chinese are currently designing their own stealth fighter aircraft the fc thirty one which analysts have noted resembles the f thirty five
according to <unk> f. johnson a correspondent for ihs jane's defence weekly the fc thirty one looks <unk> and its shape mimics that of the f thirty five in some respects but it's questionable whether it rivals its american counterpart from a performance and technological point of view
a data breach impacting defense contractor lockheed martin the maker of the f thirty five was originally reported in two thousand and nine
the company told cnn at the time that to its knowledge no highly classified information had been accessed
it declined to comment on the latest documents

how good is china's new stealth fighter
der spiegel released a new trove of leaked top secret documents on saturday it says are from the archive of snowden a former contractor for the national security agency
he is currently living in russia and faces charges of espionage in the united states
the aircraft's cockpit voice recorder which captures all noises on the flight deck was recovered last week from the depths of the java sea along with the other so called black box the flight data recorder
the voice from the cockpit does not show any sign of a terrorist attack
it is only the pilot sounding very busy andreas <unk> an investigator at indonesia's national transportation safety committee said in an interview with the news agency reuters
he said monday that investigators had heard no threats in the recordings
we didn't hear any voice of other persons other than the pilots <unk> <unk> another investigator told reuters
but it remains a mystery what brought down the aircraft on december twenty eight as it flew from the indonesian city of surabaya toward singapore with one hundred and sixty two people on board
flight qz eight thousand five hundred and one was traveling through an area of heavy thunderstorms when it crashed
the pilot requested permission to turn and climb to a higher altitude because of the weather before contact was lost with air traffic control according to indonesian officials
was weather mechanical failure or human error to blame
investigators have to be very careful before they make any definitive calls according to christopher voss a former fbi agent who investigated the crash of <unk> flight eight hundred off the coast of new york in one thousand nine hundred and ninety six
you want to make absolutely certain before you rule anything in for sure or rule anything out for sure he told cnn
investigators need to identify whether the crash was caused by a problem that could affect other flight crews or aircraft voss said
while transportation officials focus on figuring out what happened search teams are still looking for most of the bodies of the people who were on board the plane
more than three weeks after the crash the remains of fifty three people have been recovered some of them still strapped into seats
many of the rest could be in the wreckage of the fuselage which searchers located last week at the bottom of the sea
but their efforts to examine and get inside the wreckage have been hindered by high waves and strong currents
the divers couldn't even reach the bottom which hampered our operation supriyadi an operations coordinator for indonesia's search and rescue agency told reporters
they did managed to recover a few bits of debris from the area including passenger windows and seats airasia said in a statement
search officials have said they are considering using giant balloons to lift the roughly one hundred foot long fuselage from the seafloor to the surface as they did with the tail section of the aircraft earlier this month
the passenger is being kept overnight at <unk> university medical center for further evaluation in an abundance of caution spokeswoman nancy <unk> said
luke <unk> a spokesman for united said an ill passenger was on a flight that arrived in newark from brussels monday afternoon
after arriving at newark airport from brussels medical personnel met a united flight to assist an ill passenger on board he said
passengers and crew stayed on the plane until the medical personnel cleared the aircraft
while the centers for disease control and prevention acknowledges it's possible a person infected with ebola in west africa could get on a plane and arrive in another country the chances of the virus spreading during the journey are low
it's very unlikely that they would be able to spread the disease to fellow passengers stephen monroe deputy director of the cdc's national center for emerging zoonotic and infectious diseases told cnn last year
the ebola virus spreads through direct contact with the blood secretions or other body fluids of ill people and indirect contact for example with needles and other things that may be contaminated with these fluids
it's a <unk> morning at <unk> financial district in the chinese city of <unk>

take a look and see what's missing
the people
after several highly publicized and embarrassing incidents of air rage the civil aviation administration of china said last week it is considering steps to blacklist offending passengers according to state media
no final decision has been made on the proposed no fly list but it could lead to legal punishments
from <unk> hot water at a flight attendant to fights over crying babies outbursts by chinese passengers have disrupted several flights in recent weeks both in china and further afield
in one of the most recent episodes a flight departing a city in southwestern china was canceled after <unk> passengers opened three emergency exits following a seven hour delay
james <unk> aviation expert journalist and author of china airborne says the flurry of angry episodes reveals growing pains in china's airline industry
many newly prosperous travelers have never experienced the kind of travel headaches long familiar to the rest of us he adds
it's a nation of first generation air travelers <unk> said
all of the <unk> and beating down the rest of us have had now for decades about how you have to behave in airports and airliners is coming as a new experience to a lot of people in china
chinese travelers also have to <unk> with chronic delays in the country's busiest air hubs
<unk> blames much of the misery on the chinese military which controls the vast majority of the country's increasingly crowded airspace
aviation authorities have opened new commercial flight routes in recent years in an effort to improve china's <unk> on time performance record and the government has approved a second international airport in beijing to ease the congestion but these steps will take time to take effect
<unk> says chinese culture also plays a role in the behavior of certain chinese air travelers
it's perhaps the most <unk> country i've ever been in
it's every person for himself or herself he says
we're seeing a lesson about how the people in china feel they have to behave
i am glad to be in havana and glad alan gross is not said sen. dick durbin d illinois referring to the u.s. state department subcontractor who was freed last month as part of the landmark deal
gross had spent five years of a fifteen year sentence in cuban prison for <unk> banned communications equipment to cuba
the delegation was led by sen. patrick leahy d vermont who played a crucial part in the negotiations to free gross and along with durbin included sen. sheldon whitehouse d rhode island sen. debbie <unk> d michigan rep. peter <unk> d vermont and rep. christopher van hollen d maryland
the group met with cuban officials to talk about improving political and trade relations
on wednesday a state department delegation will travel to havana to discuss migration issues and the restoration of full diplomatic ties
the meetings mark the highest level talks between cuba and the u.s. governments in thirty five years u.s. officials said
this is historic durbin said at a news conference in havana on monday
we were frozen in the same foreign policy with cuba for over fifty years
finally this president came to the realization that this policy wasn't serving the interest of the united states or of cuba or of the world
the two sides are expected to discuss increasing staffing numbers and the restriction currently placed on u.s. diplomats that forbids them traveling more than twenty five miles from the interests section
cuban diplomats in washington and new york face similar limitations on u.s. travel
u.s. officials have also said they will push for cubans to have free access to the soon to <unk> u.s. embassy which they said could open before obama and cuban leader raul castro next see each other at the summit of the americas in april in panama
u.s. lawmakers opposed to the normalizing of relations said they may try to block the confirmation of a u.s
ambassador to havana and any increase in funding to the us diplomatic mission there
but john <unk> who served as chief of mission to the u.s
interests in havana from two thousand and eleven to two thousand and fourteen said having a u.s. embassy in cuba would ultimately serve american interests
we have a large number of cubans <unk> to the u.s. and now visiting the u.s. <unk> said
likewise we have many more americans coming to cuba and a small percentage of those run into problems
they have accidents they become injured or ill and wherever they are abroad they look to the u.s. embassy to provide assistance
we will need additional full time staff to deal with these challenges
last week the u.s. relaxed some of the travel restrictions meaning more americans can visit the once off limits island nation
the change in policy is expected to also allow major u.s. airlines to provide regular service to cuba
while travel restrictions are only now being loosened already people are visiting cuba from the u.s. in greater numbers
last year one hundred thousand u.s. citizens visited cuba on people to people cultural travel and some four hundred thousand cubans living in the u.s. made trips back to the island
there was also some easing of commercial rules americans can use credit cards while there and they can bring back four hundred dollar worth of cuban goods and one hundred dollar of cigars or rum
the major shift in u.s. policy could be featured in obama's state of the union address on tuesday as the white house announced alan gross would attend the speech as a guest of first lady michelle obama
leahy said that gross was still transitioning from a prisoner <unk> in cuban prison to being <unk> by washington's political elite
i talked to alan about this leahy said
and he said wow i am kind of looking forward to this
fifty percent say they approve of the job obama's doing as president according to a washington post abc news poll released on monday
that's the best obama's fared since the spring of two thousand and thirteen and it's the latest in a string of surveys showing obama's ratings inching up including a cnn orc poll from late december showing obama at a twenty month approval high
obama's state of the union wades into two thousand and sixteen
improving economic conditions have finally triggered more optimism in the country the surveys show though many americans still say the nation's financial state is poor
even as more people feel the benefits of a <unk> economy there's still a persistent sense among americans that it's not improving fast enough
the washington post abc poll out monday showed fifty six percents of americans felt the country was on the wrong track an improvement from the seventy percents who felt that way in two thousand and thirteen but still reflective of a majority who aren't seeing much to crow about in the economic recovery
that gloom is part of the reason democrats fared so poorly in november's midterm elections and why obama's address on tuesday will be delivered to the first gop majority congress of obama's presidency
the white house hopes that with improving approval poll numbers will come more unity among democrats around obama's agenda which aides say can be reduced to three words
middle class economics
it's important for us to find every single way that we can to provide some relief for middle class families because as the economy finally after six years gets to the point where people are beginning to feel it we need to make sure we lean in so that folks have a little bit more money at the end of the week said david <unk> the director of obama's political office
that means proposing new tax breaks for married couples where each partner works increasing the child care tax credit and offering two years of community college free to qualified applicants
the white house says those kinds of moves will help bolster middle class americans who aren't yet feeling the economic recovery despite plenty of data indicating the country moving further away from the recession
but even as obama finds himself more popular than he has been in months his agenda appears to be facing its toughest challenge yet with republicans in control of both chambers of congress
gop leaders have already dismissed the white house tax plan as an <unk> bid at tax reform an issue both sides say they want to tackle in the final two years of obama's presidency
the president's aides say they still expect to make progress
the state of the union is an opportunity for the president to lay out his vision to put forward his proposals
republicans now in charge of congress will have an opportunity to put forward their proposals <unk> said
this is the beginning of a process and we hope that it's fruitful
he announced confidently to a group that included a number of british <unk> that the police in the united kingdom don't dare to <unk> in these zones where sharia law is widely used
<unk> muslims establish enclaves and carry out as much of sharia law as they can without regard for the laws of the democratic countries which provided them a new home he said
this is the sort of ill informed fantasy that plays well in certain right wing circles
this probably works for jindal back home in louisiana
oddly enough fox news got into trouble recently on the no go zone nonsense too as when steve emerson a so called terrorism expert explained to the american masses that birmingham a major british urban center was populated entirely by muslims and that non muslims just simply don't go in
british prime minister david cameron correctly labeled him a complete idiot and emerson's remark caused a spokesperson for the network to admit that muslim no go zones don't actually exist not in britain not in europe
needless to say there are places where a lot of muslim immigrants live in close proximity and outsiders might feel uncomfortable walking around
the same would be true for parts of america where you might feel uncomfortable walking around if you were say black or white it would depend on the neighborhood
it's not unusual for <unk> economic even racial or ethnic groups to cluster
my own grandparents came to the united states as immigrants in one thousand nine hundred and twelve and they lived for some years in italian ghettos in new york
most immigrant groups start in ghettos somewhere and many of them never get out
but the question of sharia law is interesting
unofficial sharia courts will be found in europe here and there
but these arbitration bodies don't trump the legal system of the country where they occur
an article in the economist noted in fact that there have long been <unk> courts in jewish neighborhoods in britain not a dissimilar sort of thing
there are even places in the united states where christians can work out their disputes in a kind of <unk> manner
family law for instance is often the issue here and there are cultural values that play into the need for this kind of culturally <unk> arbitration
that in some muslim neighborhoods there might be an accommodation to sharia law seems not surprising and this doesn't mean that sooner or later we can expect <unk> women to be <unk> to death in birmingham or thieves to have their hands <unk> off in east london
blasphemy will not soon lead to the gas chamber in europe indeed capital punishment is not legal in any european country
getting back to gov
jindal one has to wonder what prompted his ignorant outburst
was this a lame attempt to play into the broad public fears of radical islam that have arisen in the wake of the charlie hebdo killings
if so that's not good enough for a politician with any shred of integrity
in my view jindal immediately <unk> himself from ever holding a national political office by making such a bizarre statement though it hasn't stopped any number of american politicians with bizarre notions from winning major national offices in the past
such behavior does however embarrass this country in the court of world opinion
the british and most european countries have struggled to accommodate muslim immigrants but they have nevertheless welcomed them in large numbers
for the most part these immigrants have behaved well despite the fear of their traditions and beliefs that leads to crazy <unk> by politicians such as jindal
there have been isolated and gruesome incidents of terrorism the murder of a british soldier lee <unk> in the spring of two thousand and thirteen comes to mind or the vicious attacks in london of july seven two thousand and five which left fifty two dead and over seven hundred injured
the british have had to confront terror and they've done so without <unk> large parts of their own population
indeed they've been forced to come to terms with what i would call british <unk> the old imperial feeling that nobody who is not british can possibly lead a civilized way of life
jindal was apparently on a ten day fact finding mission designed to bolster his credentials for a possible run at the white house in two thousand and sixteen
he's not as stupid as he sounds in fact
let's hope that he is a quick study and that he learns how not to say <unk> things in public that cause a good deal of offense if not harm to <unk> people fueling hatred rather than coming to terms
as we mark martin luther king jr. day this year it's worth asking
can america handle either one
when nelson mandela became president of south africa after the end of apartheid he had two choices
he could have gone down a path of confrontation and retribution against the white <unk> who had ruled so <unk>
or he could have skipped quickly past the history and reality of apartheid and pardoned all its perpetrators in the interests of maintaining order
he did neither
in one of his many acts of civic genius he chose a path for his country that exposed the ugliness of the past and only then invited forgiveness
his government launched a truth and reconciliation commission led by archbishop desmond tutu
the commission gathered public testimony across the land naming the institutional structures and individual acts that had <unk> blacks
no perpetrator was granted amnesty without a candid accounting of his or her deeds
the opportunity for <unk> justice gave every participant a sense of heightened responsibility a chance to be bigger citizens together
only then could reconciliation begin
and though the commission was not sufficient to solve race in post apartheid south africa it was still necessary
without such an attempt at formal accounting without such an opportunity for <unk> and <unk> to face one another that nation's challenges would be even greater today
for proof consider our own nation one hundred and fifty years post slavery
for a <unk> while after the civil war we tried reconstruction
<unk> could earn wages and vote freely and claim an equal place in politics
then we gave up on reconstruction
and jim crow came along to make black citizens second class and to ensure that neither truth telling nor reconciliation would be on the agenda
consider our nation fifty years post civil rights movement
that movement is sometimes called the second reconstruction
it sought to finish the fight to make truly equal citizens out of the descendants of slaves
but here we are today still plagued post ferguson and post staten island by divisions of color and <unk> and by an inability to talk about them without angry <unk>
that's why it's worth asking whether the united states today could take a page from south africa's script
<unk> davis a civil rights attorney and <unk> justice activist in oakland california has proposed just that
in a widely circulated essay in yes
magazine davis argues that ferguson missouri needs a truth and reconciliation commission on <unk> violence against african americans and that america does too
you can hear the objections already
for instance
won't <unk> acts of racism from the past just make it harder for us all to get along
but of course racism is not only in the past
it did not end with the <unk> amendment of one thousand eight hundred and sixty five or with the voting rights act of one thousand nine hundred and sixty five
it is present in the acts and attitudes of many today
it is present in the institutional residue of past choices
that the phrase <unk> must be said says it all
the criminal justice system the education system the economic system and the pop culture system all of them value black lives black voices and black experience less than fully
we must all face that fact
there's also this objection to a commission
that by <unk> everything it would basically be racist
consider the words of supreme court chief justice john roberts who arguing against affirmative action once wrote that the way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discrimination on the basis of race
this <unk> <unk> <unk> out history
it <unk> the difference between injury and remedy
it wants to rush us along to a <unk> that our society hasn't yet earned and perhaps shouldn't even seek as an ideal
as a chinese american i am an <unk> of what white people wrote in the constitution and what they did to subvert it
i am the <unk> of what black people and people of every color have done to <unk> the constitution
i am sometimes the object of a presumption that yellow people are presumed foreign until proven otherwise
i own the good the bad and the ugly of this country
none of this is neat
none of it is <unk> either
ultimately the deepest objection to a racial truth and reconciliation process in america is that it would be hard
hard to start and to finish
we americans can be a bit lazy when it comes to messy civic and historical <unk>
we want our stories and our story to have happy <unk>
we want reconciliation on the cheap
but the point of <unk> day and of <unk> entire life is that true redemption is never cheap or easy
so to honor him truly let's commit to what's hard
whether through official commissions or citizen conversations let's face ourselves
editor's note
<unk> <unk> a cnn contributor and a democratic strategist is vice chairwoman for voter registration and participation at the democratic national committee
a nationally <unk> columnist she is an adjunct professor at georgetown university and author of cooking with <unk>
stirring the <unk> in america
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author
but like dr. king we must continue to march on
we march on toward the realization of the american dream
we are not diverted by those who would deny opportunity based on what we look like or where we came from or who would deny equality based on who we love
we march on poverty until every child has the <unk> of body and mind needed to fuel their chance at success
we must find ways to bring those from the outskirts of hope closer to the circle of opportunity
we march on ballot boxes because the rights for which we fought are too important to give up now
and no one should silence us simply because they might disagree with our views
we march on because all lives matter not to be judged by the color of their skin
how long
not long because the images and words and fights of half a century ago still have the power to <unk> us to march
how long
i don't really know
but as dr. king once told us the arc of the moral universe is long but it <unk> toward justice
this year i know i am not the only one with the oscar nominated selma on my mind
across the country people are lining up in theaters and watching a raw image of the sacrifice six hundred voting rights marchers made
as they pursued the right to vote they were brutally attacked by police using billy clubs and tear gas
the lessons of the struggle depicted in this movie are important important enough to be mindful of them every day
but we should be especially mindful as we celebrate martin luther king jr. day
today is a day of national reflection but it is also a day of action
remembering those who sacrificed before us is important but carrying on their legacy and continuing to march forward is essential
the walk from selma to montgomery that turned into bloody sunday leaves us with a strong reminder of how much those before us gave for basic human rights
the walk is a strong reminder of how john lewis stood side by side with dr. king so that today he can stand in the chambers of congress and continue to use his voice to fight as he did fifty years ago for the right to vote
because even though fifty years have passed since the marches of one thousand nine hundred and sixty five that led to the passage of the voting rights act of one thousand nine hundred and sixty five we are still in that fight today
just last week republican house judiciary chair bob <unk> said that it's not necessary to fix the <unk> voting rights act after the supreme court's decision left the door open to <unk> and unfair voting restrictions
all i can say is he either does not read the news or he doesn't think protecting all eligible americans right to vote is important
in the last election cycle we saw the country take significant steps backward as more states restricted the right to vote
in ohio and wisconsin republicans passed measures limiting the times polls are open and cutting weekend voting typically favored by black and low income voters
in north carolina republicans passed what have been called the nation's most restrictive voting laws establishing rules that make it more difficult for people to register to and actually vote
in texas students were banned from using student <unk> as a valid form of identification while recently married or <unk> women were stopped from voting if their names did not match their <unk>
and it's important to remember that all of these new voting restrictions are aimed at addressing a problem that does not exist
reported cases of voter fraud are incredibly rare so it's puzzling why the gop is so <unk> on pushing these laws
one thing we do know is that these laws disproportionately affect women young people the elderly african american and latino voters voters who traditionally vote for democrats
those negatively affected by these unnecessary indeed <unk> voting restrictions constitute over half of the voting population
the two thousand and fourteen midterm elections left us with even more conservative state houses and more conservative governors so it's never been more important that we remain vigilant in fighting back against these discriminatory measures
when more voices are heard our country is better for it
when more voices are heard the leaders better represent the views of those they represent
our country has seen unrest this year and as our civil rights leaders taught us a vote is the clearest way to make our voices heard to stand up for our convictions
we have such a pressing moral obligation to live up to the name of this day
for dr. king who gave his life along with many others including <unk> lee jackson <unk> <unk> and the rev
james <unk> for the six hundred individuals who made unbelievable sacrifices that day in selma for our children who should not have to face the same hardship the men and women before us had to face
let's honor this day and those who fought for freedom before us and let's keep fighting for the things we still believe make us the country we are today
let us continue to march on
a soft spoken and shy man shin shared his harrowing story about escaping from a total control zone called camp fourteen giving western audiences an accessible reading on north korea
over the weekend shin stated that parts of his stories are inaccurate although he did not specify which aspects
he posted on facebook that parts of his past that i so badly wanted to cover up can no longer be hidden
<unk> harden author of escape from camp fourteen wrote on his website that shin had admitted several inaccuracies including the length of time he spent in camp fourteen
shin's high profile role and now admitted inconsistencies in his story raised concerns that it could undermine human rights advocacy efforts and distract from testimonies by other north korean refugees
there are a lot of people who actually have been to the camp and experienced it
it will be wrong for their witness accounts to lose credibility because of this incident said <unk> <unk> <unk> a former north korean camp guard who knows shin
peter jung director of the human rights group justice for north korea said he's worried that people testifying about north korea will be called a <unk> but that shin's new revelations can't challenge the fact that north korea control camps exist
jung said that many north korean refugees such as shin suffer from major trauma after escaping the regime and called for support
i hope he gathers his courage and tells his story accurately and honestly and we must help him do that
north korean <unk> and testimonies can not be verified there are no paper trails and investigators can not interview or access witnesses in a closed society
their stories are compared for consistency with other defectors and experts but the process is far from foolproof
cnn has not been able to reach shin who noted in his social media apology that these will be my final words and this will likely be my final post
shin's admission of inaccuracies comes at a time of <unk> attention on north korea's human rights record following a landmark u.n. commission of inquiry report listing abuses of the pyongyang regime
while escape from camp fourteen was not the sole reason for the creation of the commission <unk> <unk> then the u.n. high commissioner for human rights urged the probe after meeting shin and another north korean prison camp survivor in december two thousand and twelve
since the commission report's release in two thousand and fourteen the u.n. general assembly has called for more sanctions and a referral of those responsible to the international criminal court
the matter remains at the u.n. security council where it's likely china would block referrals of kim jong un and his leadership to the international criminal court
michael kirby chairman of the commission of inquiry into north korea said that shin's testimony consisted of only two <unk> in the four hundred page report and that he was only one of hundreds of north korean witnesses
it's a very small part of a very long story
and it really doesn't affect the credibility of the testimony which is online he said
lots of people took part this inquiry
their stories are powerful and convincing and these stories do not only represent shin but other people in north korea
in a reversal of his story told for years shin told harden on friday that he had been transferred to another prison camp eighteen when he was six instead of spending his entire life inside north korea at the total control zone camp fourteen the author says on his website
the distinction of whether shin was imprisoned in camp fourteen or eighteen was not a deal breaker for kirby
it seems as if the issue is whether he was in the total control zone or whether he was in an ordinary prison camp
in another words it's whether triple horror or double horror kirby said
shin bears the physical scars of torture including a missing <unk> and burn marks on his back according to the book
and harden noted in his book that during the interview process shin at times was unreliable and in many crucial instances corrected his korean memoir an autobiography that shin wrote in two thousand and seven called escape to the outside world which was only published in korean
north korea had sought to <unk> shin
last fall a pro north korea government website released videos with english <unk> featuring a man whom shin recognized to be his father <unk> the story that his son was ever in a prison camp
shin responded with a statement accusing the government of holding my father hostage
it's unclear if the video had any bearing on the timing of shin's admission
<unk> the former prison camp guard who has known shin for seven years said he believes the <unk> of shin's story is true and that torture in either camp is still the same
shin became an icon for north korean human rights
whether he was in camp fourteen or camp eighteen he is definitely a person from a political prison camp
he was born there and tortured there
a small group of german tourists is trapped inside
the bargain priced apartment they've been renting maybe doesn't seem like such a good deal now
there's no word of when a maintenance engineer will show up or even if such a person exists
this is clearly no <unk> ivory tower
and that's just the way cuban author <unk> juan gutierrez likes it
up here i'm like a ghost
i've been a privileged witness to what has gone on in the neighborhood he told me on a recent visit to his home
gutierrez has been living on the top floor for more than thirty years now
he's transformed a small roof terrace into his own observation platform to peer down on what he calls central havana's dirty reality
these days gutierrez says he's turned to buddhism to beat his addictions to cheap rum and wild sex
up in his ninth floor sanctuary he's just about out of harm's way
but one <unk> and he may just fall he says maybe he'll join me for a small drink down at ground level in the next few days
gutierrez has rarely been so clean living
he says he's spent most of the last three decades <unk> the streets and alleys below
things are continually happening down there
pornographic erotic <unk> and <unk> <unk> he explained wide eyed
<unk> almost twenty works of <unk> and poetry are foul <unk> cynical and scathing
the kinder literary critics have dubbed him the pioneer of dirty realism
his worst critics have condemned him as a crude <unk> for example before you even finish the first page of his acclaimed dirty <unk> of havana there are graphic sexual scenes
some people accuse me of <unk> but i say no
the reality is excessive
i have to tone things down to make it believable
it's a very brutal violent reality and in order to make it credible you have to tone it down a bit he says
but i am interested in ugliness the ethics and the aesthetics of the dirty ones the poorest people who live right on the edge he adds
his <unk> works are centered on the one thousand nine hundred and ninety s during cuba's so called special period
that was just after the soviet union collapsed leaving its caribbean ally cuba to economic <unk> and ruin devoid of subsidies or a market for its goods
but gutierrez says not a lot has improved since then at least in central and old havana
everything has stayed the same here
the same poverty the same misery the same people who are just survivors he said
i write about people surviving on the limits
<unk> his finger into the afternoon sun gutierrez points out <unk> colon <unk> and san <unk> the four streets that he says once formed cuba's largest red light district before the one thousand nine hundred and fifty nine revolution
he suggests that prostitution migration from the countryside to the capital and the <unk> of extended families are the root causes of the chaos he says still <unk> in this area
there were hundreds or thousands of <unk> down there
the people left there today are the daughters and the <unk> of the <unk>
that's important to note in social terms
this was never a normal neighborhood he explained with a grin
gutierrez worked for twenty six years as a journalist for state run newspapers and magazines
but when he began publishing his crude and critical brand of fiction he was fired
he's pushed the boundaries of free speech in cuba but has never been jailed for speaking his mind
he seems to have little intention of keeping quiet
i'm soon going to be sixty five
i have to take advantage of those years to say what i have to say
people don't dare
they just die with their <unk> shut
when you have ideas you have to express them gutierrez said
his literary depiction of his neighbors here in central havana may seem harsh
but walking the streets you can quickly see he may have a valid point
a few doors from his apartment building there's the entrance to the local revolutionary defense committee a neighborhood group set up to promote the values of the revolution
on the door a black and white photo of a young fidel castro
diagonally opposite is a small store with welded bars at the window
the only thing inside a huge <unk> of white rum
a half measure sells for forty cents and a full seven hundred and fifty <unk> goes for eighty cents
it was only mid morning but a man rooted through the trash outside pulled out a small plastic bottle and with <unk> hands asked for a fill up
that surely can not be what castro enshrined in the poster across the street had in mind
a land where tourists drink mint filled <unk> while a few blocks away an alcoholic worker knocks back a huge <unk> of train sparks the name cubans colloquially give to cheap industrial strength rum
this neighborhood always was on the margins of all the talk of revolutionary ideals
maybe in the seventies and eighties when there was some kind of revolutionary pride it was a little different
but generally people stayed on the sidelines gutierrez told me
while his works are <unk> critical of the decades long social breakdown in his neighborhood his overall outlook on life and the cuban system is more nuanced
when castro and his rebels seized power in one thousand nine hundred and fifty nine gutierrez was seven years old selling ice cream on havana's streets
he recalls the brutality of the outgoing dictatorship of general <unk> batista and the celebrations and hopes for newfound freedom ushered in by the rebel forces
there was a lot of joy in the first few days
it was like freedom had arrived he said
despite the experiences of the decades since then gutierrez says he still considers himself a romantic leftist
he rejects suggestions that he has anything in common with cuba's right wing dissident movement
i think is trying to save the good things of socialism and the revolution like education health and national pride
we still have to advance a great deal in human rights and personal freedoms he added
for some of <unk> neighbors change can not come fast enough
it's past midnight in a dive bar on <unk> street
a washed up boxer <unk> <unk> along to a salsa tune on the tv then asks for a double strength rum and coke
he says he was a <unk> olympic and pan american games champion
when it comes to <unk> cuba has proved itself to be in a sporting class of its own
but now fifty <unk> has little left to show for his glory years except for a nose like a lump of rubber broken so many times he has no <unk> left
in a hotel bar a few doors down on havana's <unk> waterfront a thirty three year old woman clad in leopard print hot pants sips on a <unk> beer and strikes up a conversation
she says police once gave her a ticket for <unk> tourists official speak for prostitution
she says her day job is a physical education teacher for primary school children
she earns just ten dollar a month with her state salary and spends that in the bat of one of her false <unk>
but she says the job provides her with a vital cover story
having legitimate employment she says keeps her out of trouble with the law when she turns tricks at night
she charges her foreign clients one hundred dollar a night if they don't bargain her down she says
like many others she has high hopes that she will be able to cash in on the potential influx of american tourists after president barack obama's announcement of more stable u.s. cuba relations
but back up the street gutierrez is not convinced there will be a quick fix to those relations
the problem he says are elderly cubans on both sides of the florida straits
for more than half a century there's been a lot of hatred between cubans in the u.s. and those on the island
there's been a lot of thirst for revenge
we have to wait for the years to pass and the old men to die he says
only then can we resolve things in a civilized way
but on tuesday the situation in yemen apparently became much more dire as the country's minister of information said shiite houthi rebels had taken over the nation's presidential palace
amid reports of renewed fighting in yemen nadia sakkaf told cnn that the residence of yemen's prime minister was under attack
sakkaf called the situation the completion of a coup adding that president abdu rabu mansour hadi has no control
yemen the poorest country in the region is home to al qaeda in the arabian peninsula or aqap which most recently claimed responsibility for the massacre of journalists at the french satirical magazine charlie hebdo in paris
it's one of the world's biggest <unk> of terrorism
aqap is benefiting hugely from the current conflict in yemen
gunfire could be heard throughout the capital sanaa on tuesday as cnn's nick paton walsh reported that security there was tenuous
on monday night unknown assailants fired shots at a u.s. embassy vehicle in the city the embassy said
it has said it's prepared to evacuate but no orders have been given
here are seven things you need to know about what's happening in yemen and why it matters
yemen is a country of about twenty six million people on the southwestern tip of the arabian peninsula
it borders saudi arabia and oman and is near important red sea shipping lanes
yemen is a young nation having been created in one thousand nine hundred and ninety when north and south yemen united
the north and south started a civil war within a few years with the north prevailing after thousands died
yemen is very poor because of declining oil resources
because terrorists in yemen have reached into the united states
remember umar farouk abdulmutallab the underwear bomber who tried to blow up an american <unk> over detroit in two thousand and nine
he took his marching orders from aqap
the boston marathon bombing suspects and maj. nidal hasan the american soldier who gunned down thirteen people at fort hood texas apparently were inspired by an american born cleric in yemen anwar al awlaki
an american drone killed him in two thousand and eleven
many would be jihadis from the west are recruited into al qaeda through a slick english language online magazine inspire that's run out of yemen
u.s. officials consider aqap the most dangerous branch of al qaeda according to cnn terrorism analyst paul cruickshank
it's actually a three way battle among the government the houthis and aqap
the houthis a rebel group composed of shiite muslims feel marginalized in the majority sunni country
in september houthis seized government buildings in sanaa and its airport
they demanded greater political influence
president hadi introduced a new constitution without the houthis approval and the rebels abducted yemen's presidential chief of staff to show their disapproval
in response the government closed roads as a security measure
that set off renewed fighting
most of the recent fighting has been for control of the presidential complex
on monday the government and the houthis announced another ceasefire
hadi has battled aqap since taking office in two thousand and twelve and the united states has invested heavily in this campaign
he reorganized yemen's military and for a while put aqap on the defensive
but the conflict with the houthis diverted resources that could be used against aqap
aqap is working to keep things unstable but it doesn't look like the group has been involved in the sanaa fighting so far
in october aqap staged a suicide bombing against a houthi rally that killed fifty people
it also released a video showing members executing fourteen houthis
at the same time it has stepped up attacks against police and the army
no way
in fact they're adversaries in the long running sunni shiite conflict
differences between the two main branches of islam developed over the centuries
shiite muslims believed the prophet <unk> cousin should have been the successor after his death in in <unk> six hundred and thirty two while sunnis believe a successor should have been elected
only ten percents of the world's muslim population is shiite
they're named after the late cleric hussein <unk> al <unk> who was killed during a two thousand and four rebellion against the government in saada according to the u.s. state department
houthis are mostly militias and tribes that follow the <unk> sect of islam
al qaeda considers them shiites
some members of al qaeda and even western diplomats allege that iran one of the few shiite muslim nations is <unk> the houthi rebellion in an effort to control yemen's red sea coast on one of the world's busiest shipping lanes
the houthis deny iran is funding them
hadi has said the houthis are being trained and advised by hezbollah the lebanese shiite militia
some presidential officials are worried about actions by republican guards former regime officials who are still loyal to ali abdullah saleh the ex president who was kicked out in two thousand and twelve during the arab spring
the weaker the government the easier it will be for al qaeda to bring in people and train them for terrorism
the chaos <unk> western efforts to hunt down al qaeda and <unk> western efforts to even be in the country
on sunday morning the militants targeted the villages of <unk> and <unk> in the mayo <unk> division of cameroon's far north region <unk> more than eighty houses and taking captives
three of those abducted were later found dead state run media reported
<unk> bakary the regional governor told cnn on monday that soldiers from the cameroon <unk> mobile intervention <unk> freed some of the captives during an operation against boko haram
the twenty four people regained their freedom as the soldiers were chasing the boko haram militants
the insurgents were fleeing back to nigeria from <unk> they came he said
col. didier badjeck a cameroonian defense ministry spokesman confirmed the captives had been freed
communication minister issa <unk> bakary said sunday's mass abduction was the largest that boko haram has conducted inside cameroon
the kidnappings came as some two thousand chadian troops arrived in cameroon to help fight the insurgents
the deployment followed cameroonian president paul <unk> call for international cooperation in the fight against boko haram
cameroon has already deployed about seven thousand troops across the far north where boko haram has scaled up attacks over the past six months
boko haram has terrorized northern nigeria regularly since two thousand and nine attacking police schools churches and civilians and bombing government buildings
it has also kidnapped students including more than two hundred schoolgirls who were abducted in april and remain missing
the islamist group has said its aim is to impose a stricter form of sharia law across nigeria which is split between a majority muslim north and a mostly christian south
initially boko haram militants crossed the border into neighboring cameroon to steal food or kidnap foreign nationals but more recently the group has attacked military installations
while chad is the first country to put boots on the ground in cameroon the international community and regional bodies are also expressing concern
the u.n. security council is expected to condemn boko haram by name in a strongly <unk> statement later monday
put the seventy seven year old pontiff in front of a microphone and he will make news
case in point a brief press conference on monday aboard the papal plane from the philippines to rome when francis sounded off in his very <unk> like way on birth control corruption and kicking <unk> where the sun don't shine
here are those and several other eye opening comments from francis over his nearly two years as pope
answering a question about birth control on monday francis said that parents shouldn't <unk> endlessly trusting in god that it will all work out
but god gives you methods to be responsible francis said
some think that excuse me if i use that word that in order to be good catholics we have to be like <unk>
no
responsible parenthood
that doesn't mean the pope now supports artificial birth control
the church has long allowed natural methods of preventing pregnancies
on his way to the philippines last week francis was asked about the terrorist attack on the french magazine charlie hebdo
while denouncing terrorism the pope said there are limits to free speech
if dr. gasbarri a great friend says a swear word against my mother then a punch awaits him francis said referring to alberto gasbarri a man who organizes papal trips and was then standing next to him on the plane
it's normal it's normal
one can not provoke one can not insult other people's faith one can not make fun of faith
the pope said monday that in theory violence <unk> jesus turn the other cheek teachings but in practice people must be prudent enough not to needlessly provoke others unless they want to risk a harsh response
when he was a bishop in argentina francis said monday a couple of suspicious men offered four hundred thousand dollar to his poor neighborhood but only if he first made a significant deposit with them
if you think that sounds like the real world version of email phishing scams the pontiff would probably agree
in that moment i thought about what i would do
either i insult them and give them a kick where the sun doesn't shine or i play the fool
francis said he played the fool telling the men that his office didn't have a bank account they would have to check with the church's financial experts in the <unk>
the pope said he later wondered if he let them off too easy allowing them to take advantage of others
who am i to judge gay priests
in two thousand and thirteen the pope was asked about the so called gay lobby in the vatican
if someone is gay and he searches for the lord and has good will who am i to judge
francis said a rhetorical question that rocketed around the world
though he was answering a question about the so called gay lobby at the vatican the pope indicated a change in tone if not in teaching in the church's stance towards gays and lesbians more generally
meeting with catholic leaders from his native latin america and the caribbean last year the pope said that there are a lot of holy people in the curia <unk> rome based bureaucracy
but there is also a stream of corruption francis said including a gay lobby
we need to see what we can do he added somewhat <unk>
only the pope knows exactly what he means
the vatican has <unk> up refusing to explain
catholic experts believe francis was referring to a secret <unk> presented to his predecessor pope benedict <unk> that investigated a series of embarrassing leaks from vatican insiders to italian journalists
the <unk> referred to a vatican network of sexually active gay <unk> who might have been subject to <unk> according to italian reports
the internet is god's gift but beware of the trolls
the internet in particular offers immense possibilities for encounter and solidarity francis said last year
this is something truly good a gift from god
at the same time though all those tweets and texts and comment streams can cause us to lose our bearings said the pontiff
the speed with which information is communicated <unk> our capacity for reflection and judgment and this does not make for more balanced and proper forms of self expression
all atheists go to heaven
during a homily in rome last may francis said that god <unk> everyone not just christians but atheists as well
we must meet one another doing good the pope said
to those who say
but i don't believe father i am an atheist
the pope said but do good
we will meet one another there
so was the pope saying that people can go to heaven even if they don't believe in god
probably not say church experts
catholicism has long held that salvation is open to everyone but with a really big caveat
if you know about the church and don't become a member the door to heaven is likely closed a catholic spokesman said
many american atheists say they appreciated the olive branch from the pope however unclear his remarks may have been
i didn't want to be pope
meeting with catholic students from italy and <unk> last june francis <unk> his boring speech and instead took questions from the children
a little <unk> in a blue scarf elicited laughter by bluntly asking francis why did you want to become pope
i didn't francis answered
in fact a person who wants to become pope doesn't love himself
and god doesn't bless him the pontiff said
christians should mind their own <unk>
in some of his <unk> comments as pope francis has criticized christian <unk>
we all chat in church the pope said
as christians we chat
it is as if we want to put each other down francis continued
instead of growing one makes the other feel small while i feel great
that will not do
gossip the pope said is like honey
it tastes sweet at first but large doses deliver stomach aches
throwing food away is stealing from the poor
the first latin american pope has made fighting poverty a top priority of his <unk>
scarcely a speech or homily ends without a mention of the poor and marginalized
last june francis <unk> a culture of waste in which <unk> <unk> compassion people become just another disposable object and little care is given to those who need help
this culture of waste has made us insensitive even to the waste and disposal of food which is even more despicable when all over the world many individuals and families are suffering from hunger and malnutrition
francis said
we should all remember however that throwing food away is like stealing from the tables of the poor the hungry
and the potential two thousand and sixteen republican presidential candidate decried what he called immigrants insistence on non assimilation the fact that you've got people who want to come to our country but not adopt our values which he called dangerous
jindal has the reputation of policy <unk> among republicans and boldly told gop officials during a two thousand and thirteen address to the republican national committee that they must stop being the stupid party and needed to stop insulting the intelligence of voters
asked by cnn's wolf blitzer whether he would walk back his comments on no go zones made in a speech to the henry jackson society in london earlier that day jindal said not at all
and i'm also making a bigger and maybe even more controversial point that radical islam is a grave threat we need muslim leaders to denounce the individuals not just the acts of violence he said adding that it is absolutely correct to insist on assimilation of immigrants in the united states
but pressed for specific examples of such no go zones jindal <unk> saying he had met with elected officials and others to discuss them and noted a report in uk tabloid the daily mail that purported to highlight the challenges facing law enforcement in such areas
i knew by speaking the truth we were gon na make people upset jindal told blitzer
jindal was also unable to offer examples during an earlier interview with cnn's max foster saying that he's heard from folks here that there are neighborhoods where women don't feel comfortable going in without veils
we all know that there are neighborhoods where police are less likely to go into
i think that the radical left absolutely wants to pretend like this problem is not here
pretending it's not here won't make it go away he told foster
pressed for details jindal said only i think your viewers know absolutely there are places where the police are less likely to go
and asked whether that feeling may be caused by high crime rates rather than the muslim population in the area jindal said this isn't a question
i know the left wants to make this into an attack on religion and that's not what this is
what we are saying it's absolutely an issue for the uk absolutely is an issue for america and other european and western nations he said
during his london speech jindal said in the west non assimilationist muslims establish enclaves and carry out as much of sharia law as they can without regard for the laws of the democratic countries which provided them a new home according to prepared remarks
it is startling to think that any country would allow even <unk> for a so called no go zone
the idea that a free country would allow for specific areas of its country to operate in an autonomous way that is not free and is in direct opposition to its laws is hard to fathom he said
jindal also suggested the rise of such no go zones has contributed to growing anti semitism throughout europe which has prompted many jews to <unk> from their home countries
how does such evil rise again in democratic countries
jindal asked
i believe it is because radical islamists have been given too wide a berth to establish their own nation within a nation he said
muslim leaders need to condemn anyone who <unk> these acts of violence and clearly state that these people are evil and are enemies of islam he added
the idea of no go zones sparked controversy last week when a fox news commentator raised the prospect of areas in france britain sweden and germany where those countries governments don't exercise any sovereignty and which instead are run largely by muslim immigrants
the commentator also mentioned whole cities where non muslims simply don't go in in particular the city of birmingham in the united kingdom
british prime minister david cameron later pushed back on the idea calling the commentator a complete idiot
when i heard this frankly i choked on my <unk> and i thought it must be april fools day
this guy is clearly a complete idiot he said
the fox commentator later apologized to birmingham for labeling it a no go zone but stood by the idea that such areas exist
fox news however issued a formal apology for the remarks with host julie <unk> <unk> the comments as <unk> errors and saying the network deeply regret the errors and apologize to any and all who may have taken offense
cnnmoney
fox news <unk> four times for inaccurate comments about muslims in europe
but a jindal aide said the governor stuck largely to the text as prepared which included the criticism of the zones
and the remarks have drawn praise from conservatives and <unk> national media attention at a time when the potential presidential contender is looking to raise his profile in time for a white house bid
national review columnist larry <unk> called it a brilliant take on radical islam
it is the toughest speech i have read on the whole issue of islamic radicalism and its destructive murdering <unk> ways which are upsetting the entire world <unk> wrote in an op ed
it's no surprise that bobby jindal would go abroad and <unk> the facts in an effort to divide people this is exactly what we've come to expect from jindal here at home democratic national committee spokeswoman rebecca <unk> told cnn
jindal is just embarrassing himself
he is abroad while louisiana is facing a budget crisis of his own making he can't even govern his state he is the last person we want <unk> into foreign policy
opinion
bobby jindal doesn't know what he's talking about
the information collected through the classified national security agency program helped u.s. intelligence officials assess north korea's involvement in the cyberattack and ultimately led president barack obama to directly blame north korea for the attack according to a times report that cited current and former u.s. and foreign officials with knowledge of the program
starting in two thousand and ten the nsa broke into chinese networks connecting north korea to the world wide web and embedded malware into the networks used by north korea's <unk> including those working in the bureau one hundred and twenty one unit believed to be responsible for the sony hack
within weeks of the first attacks u.s. officials and eventually obama said north korea was responsible for hacking into sony's servers <unk> private salary information and personal correspondence and ultimately threatening a terrorist attack if sony released the movie the interview
north korea had called releasing the movie which depicted a comedic plot to assassinate north korean leader kim jong un an act of war
the nsa's efforts helped the u.s. develop what officials described to the times as an early warning radar though only after the fact were u.s. intelligence officials able to link the sony attacks to the north korean government
private cybersecurity companies raised doubts about the certainty and <unk> of the fbi and other u.s. agencies claims that north korea was behind the attack on sony but u.s. officials have remained firm in their conclusions and had cited additional classified information that the private companies could not access
the u.s. hit north korea with additional economic sanctions targeting specific individuals early this year keeping good on its promise to retaliate against north korea for the attack on sony
north korea also experienced widespread internet outages in late december and blamed the united states
u.s. officials declined to comment on the outages
sony pictures ultimately released the interview in select movie theaters and through youtube

gross and his wife judy were listed among the two dozen or so guests who were invited to the first lady's box a high profile seating assignment designated for americans who the white house believes illustrate their policies at work
at the time of his release in december gross was five years into a fifteen year prison sentence for allegedly working on behalf of america to undermine havana's government
on the day of his release president barack obama announced the united states would renew diplomatic relations with cuba for the first time in decades loosening travel and trade restrictions and beginning the process of opening an embassy in havana
sen. marco rubio a staunch opponent of the u.s. <unk> with cuba will counter obama's message on cuba with a guest of his own his office announced monday
rubio will host cuban activist rosa mara pay as his official guest during tuesday's address
paya is the daughter of prominent cuban dissident oswaldo paya who was killed in two thousand and twelve in a car crash that his relatives and fellow activists allege was a government assassination
in his remarks i expect the president will bring up his new cuba policy rubio said in a statement
while i disagree with the president's new cuba policy i hope rosa mara <unk> presence on tuesday night will at least remind him that her father's murderers have not been brought to justice and that the u.s. is now in fact sitting at the table with them
paya penned an open letter to obama published last month in the washington post criticizing obama's decision to normalize relations with cuba as the wrong step to foster democracy and a respect for human rights
cuba politics front and center during state of the union
others on the president's state of the union guest list include eight people who have written letters to president obama some of whom he's met with during trips around the country over the past year

only the russian army and defense ministry have them
the prime minister's spokeswoman <unk> <unk> confirmed to cnn the quotes attributed to yatsenyuk are accurate
russian officials could not be immediately reached for a response
the report came a day after protesters gathered at kiev's independence square to march for peace
yatsenyuk and ukraine's president were among those who attended the rally which had as its slogan i am volnovakha in memory of the thirteen passengers who died near the city of volnovakha after their bus was hit by artillery fire on january thirteen

we will not give up a single meter of our land
meanwhile fighting in the east continued
government forces and pro russia rebels have been battling for control of the eastern donetsk and luhansk regions since april after russia annexed ukraine's southeastern crimea region the previous month
then the real horror came
the sight of another <unk> trailer <unk> straight toward him
when i saw those lights coming i knew he was going to hit me <unk> said
and then i closed my eyes and prayed that everything turned out <unk> that was all i could do
he gripped the steering wheel tightly as the second semi smashed through his pickup crushing it like a soda can
it was just metal <unk> and glass
it was just all fast and loud
<unk> told cnn's new day that he was a man of faith
i do believe and i'm very firm in that and i just held on to the wheel as tight as i could tucked my head and just kept praying the whole time
after he hit i just hoped that it would be over with soon he said
the crash left only two things intact
the marred shell surrounding <unk> seat and <unk> who was pinned between the two trucks
when the second truck hit my back end it spun my bed underneath the first trailer that i hit and continued to swing my nose around and i guess put my nose underneath the second trailer
and as that trailer came around it just kind of pushed me down and further into that that small v where you can actually see both the <unk> within <unk> reach on both sides
and so if they would've pushed me even a foot it would have crushed me the twenty seven year old father said
but he was alive
and alert
and nearly scratch free
<unk> was part of a twenty six vehicle <unk> saturday on <unk> eighty four outside baker city oregon
this is the biggest crash i have seen in a while oregon state police sgt
kyle <unk> said
it was extremely slick out there
one semi that spun around on the black ice started the chain reaction
about a dozen people were injured including two seriously
but there were no fatalities
it's surprising no one died in this <unk> said
before trying to <unk> out <unk> decided to let the sound of traffic <unk> to make sure things were ok
then <unk> by came to help
one guy pulled my feet out just enough so i could slide out of the car
<unk> injuries
a bruise on his left <unk> and a few <unk> on his right hand
he told new day he thanked god for his survival
i don't have the answers and if i did i probably wouldn't be doing what i'm doing now
when things like that happen and what i've kinda come to realize is that it is a miracle and that i need to take that into my life and remember it and now i need to figure out who i need to be in this life and what i need to accomplish

netflix confirmed on friday that it's renewed the contracts of several bbc shows including several fan favorites
doctor who is among those that will remain available on the streaming service beyond the end of the month
last week there were concerns that the shows might not return to netflix because of an <unk> contract
fans of doctor who had launched an online petition to keep the series available
other bbc shows however weren't so lucky

he doesn't even speak arabic very well
on friday the day after belgian police killed two extremists during a raid in verviers a cnn crew met <unk> mother and sister at her home just a few hundred yards from the scene of the shoot out
at the time belgian media were suggesting he may have returned to verviers and been killed in the police raid
they were too upset to talk
at that moment they had no idea whether <unk> was alive or dead
the imam of the local mosque franck <unk> told cnn they had not seen <unk> since two thousand and thirteen
he had been a serious but kind boy and had worked in a local restaurant the imam said
<unk> and the president of the mosque <unk> <unk> said that extremism was not common among muslims in verviers but that fewer young people were attending the mosque and instead were being influenced elsewhere
while the identities of the two men killed in the police raid have not been disclosed it now seems <unk> is still alive and likely still in syria or iraq one of dozens of young belgian men and women who have left their <unk> industrial towns to wage jihad in iraq and syria
a recent study by the brookings institution in washington estimated that at least two hundred and fifty individuals have left belgium fewer than the number from britain and france but the highest in europe when measured per capita
other sources put the number above three hundred
one of them posted a photograph of himself brandishing an automatic weapon and with an ammunition belt round his neck
calling himself <unk> <unk> he said he came from <unk> a small town on the dutch border
he was reportedly the fourth resident of <unk> to leave for syria
another belgian jihadist with a high profile is abdelhamid abaaoud a twenty seven year old belgian of moroccan descent from a suburb of brussels
an isis video posted in march last year shows him in a truck <unk> four dead bodies away in the aftermath of a massacre
abaaoud's thirteen year old brother also arrived in syria later to become <unk> the youngest foreign fighter there
belgian analyst and historian <unk> van ostaeyen says jihadists help each other with travel advice through social media
one posted on facebook
everything you need is available here be it clothes or things for your home we have everything
and a tip
don't behave like a warrior
shave your beards behave like tourists and buy tickets back and forth
precise figures on the number of europeans who have gone to iraq and syria and which groups they have joined are hard to come by
the consensus among counter terrorism analysts is that more than three thousand have traveled of whom five hundred have returned including up to seventy who have come back to belgium
of those who have gone there appears to have been a sharp shift toward joining the islamic state in iraq and syria in the last year
van ostaeyen writes
if there is one important difference between those who left during the first wave and the second it would be their favor to fight for the islamic state
and isis has made it clear it plans to send fighters to europe once western forces are in its words defeated in iraq and syria
an outlawed group called sharia four belgium is suspected of arranging the travel of some would be jihadists
nearly fifty of its members are currently on trial in antwerp but almost all are being tried in <unk>
guy van vlierden an investigative journalist with belgian newspaper <unk> <unk> <unk> who tracks jihadist networks told cnn that sharia four belgium had <unk> because of prosecutions and the flow of members to syria
as an informal network though i think it still exists
and from time to time people try some kind of <unk> van vlierden said
one of the group that went to fight is <unk> <unk> <unk> a belgian moroccan from antwerp in his twenties who is believed to be in raqqa isis's self declared capital and has a facebook page in the name of abu <unk>
after the attack on a jewish museum in belgium by a gunman accused of allegiance to isis he wrote on facebook page
may allah raise up more young people who take the example of those who committed the attack in the jewish museum
analysts of islamist extremism in europe talk of a third generation muslim teenagers and men in their early twenties intensely alienated from the countries to which their parents and grandparents <unk> in hope of a better life
a significant minority among them feel marginalized within their own country and are <unk> by isis's slick <unk> propaganda machine
some even see the kouachi brothers who attacked the offices of charlie hebdo in paris as heroes
there were a number of incidents in french schools when the <unk> silence for the victims was interrupted
one college teacher in a suburb of paris with a high muslim population told cnn that since the paris attacks some muslim students had adopted the slogan <unk> as a <unk> to <unk>
few of them will ever pack their bags but they could easily be further radicalized at home
most of those who do make it to syria are raw recruits with few skills
but they learn fast and one worrying dimension of the conflict to western analysts is the coming together of this third generation with veteran jihadists men like <unk> <unk>
now forty eight <unk> left prison in two thousand and eleven after serving a long terror sentence
he is thought to have trained in afghanistan and as a young man had been condemned to death in his native morocco for trying to overthrow the monarchy
on facebook last year he suggested he was in aleppo syria
his current whereabouts are unknown
while european intelligence agencies scramble to tackle the first wave of returnees some analysts offer a few <unk> of comfort
among the hundreds who have followed their dream of jihad some never imagine returning home
<unk> a young dutchman and former soldier told a dutch television network that he did not expect to come home far less commit an attack in holland
others are killed or become suicide bombers
a few return home disillusioned with the violence
the brookings study says the threat posed by foreign fighters could be reduced by better co operation among european intelligence services
intelligence from the communications of foreign fighters shared open source monitoring and other information obtained by one service can prove crucial for discovering <unk> networks it says
van vlierden says that given their modest resources the belgian security services have been pioneers in tracking fighters
i truly think for example that the jewish museum attack wouldn't have happened with a perpetrator from belgium itself he told cnn
four people were shot dead at the museum in brussels last year
the alleged assailant a french national named mehdi nemmouche was arrested in france highlighting the additional problem posed by europe's open borders
twenty six european states are part of the <unk> agreement which <unk> passport and immigration controls between <unk>
in paris analysts and former officers in the security services have long been critical of the lack of collaboration between france's police and the domestic and foreign intelligence services in the wake of the paris attacks
that lack of communication became apparent after the toulouse shootings in two thousand and twelve when mohamed <unk> killed seven people across several days in toulouse
governments in northern europe now face threats on multiple fronts from loosely organized cells with ready access to weapons and in many cases the expertise to use them
last july <unk> <unk> <unk> and peter van ostaeyen warned in the new york times that policy makers unrealistic obsession with foreign fighters could be a distraction from a more serious domestic terrorist threat
the unfortunate lesson to be drawn from recent events in paris and belgium is that policy makers now need to focus on both
on sunday hours before he was set to testify before the national congress about his allegation he was found dead in his apartment the country's ministry of security said monday
nisman fifty one who had been investigating the jewish community center bombing that occurred more than twenty years ago was found in his bathroom with <unk> caliber gun and shell casing nearby the ministry said
no cause of death has been released but according to the buenos aires herald security secretary sergio berni and <unk> fernndez secretary general to the presidency said there are signs that nisman's death was a suicide
the forensic investigation is crucial
in forensic science when you have a body a <unk> and a weapon everything leads to one place berni said according to the newspaper
we have to wait for the judicial to confirm
buenos aires police will conduct tests on nisman's hands to see if there is gunpowder on them the state run telam news agency reported
such a test would be necessary to determine whether he committed suicide
as the days go by and we have the results from the autopsy we will be able to determine the cause of death
i can't venture a hypothesis
that wouldn't be prudent <unk> fein the federal prosecutor leading the investigation into nisman's death told reporters in buenos aires
i can confirm that there was a gun <unk> caliber gun
i can confirm that he died due to a gunshot
i can not confirm further details
i will find those out in the coming days
the prosecutor had been under the protection of a ten man security detail members of which belonged to the federal police
the detail called his secretary sunday afternoon to say he wasn't answering his phone telam reported
when he didn't answer his <unk> and his sunday newspaper was found on his doorstep the security detail reached out to his family
the detail took nisman's mother to his apartment in le <unk> tower a high rise in the puerto <unk> neighborhood of buenos aires and upon finding the door locked from the inside with the key still in the lock nisman's relatives reached out to a locksmith the agency reported
nisman's mother and a guard later found the prosecutor's body blocking a bathroom door inside his room telam said
nisman was set to testify to lawmakers behind closed doors on a report alleging that president cristina fernndez de kirchner foreign minister <unk> timerman and other officials had covered up iran's involvement in the bombing of the argentine israelite mutual association building
the attack killed eighty five people and wounded more than three hundred
fernndez de kirchner and timerman wanted to cover up iran's involvement in order to boost trade specifically oil imports and grain exports with the islamic republic nisman alleged last week according to the herald
chief of the cabinet of ministers jorge <unk> told cnn and other media outlets that nisman's allegation is crazy absurd <unk> irrational ridiculous unconstitutional
timerman also formally rejected the accusations last week
appointed in two thousand and four by fernndez de <unk> late husband then president <unk> kirchner nisman told members of the argentine opposition that he had documents to back his allegations the herald reported
he was also expected to <unk> sources for his research
congresswoman patricia bullrich who represents buenos aires in the national congress lower house and who organized the hearing said she spoke with nisman on saturday
he said he was very threatened and he knew that this was a very heavy topic she said
i am very dismayed
argentine prosecutors have long accused iran of involvement in the bombing and requested the arrest of iranian citizens in connection with it among them former defense minister ahmad vahidi former iranian president ali akbar <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> head of iran's revolutionary guard at the time of the attack
in two thousand and thirteen argentine lawmakers approved the creation of a truth commission designed to investigate the bombing in conjunction with iran
the national criminal court is investigating nisman's death the security ministry said
his body has been sent to a morgue for autopsy <unk> told cnn
israel's foreign ministry in a statement to media outlets called nisman a brave and prominent <unk> who fought <unk> for justice as he worked to expose those behind the one thousand nine hundred and ninety four attack
the state of israel voices hope that argentine authorities will continue with nisman's activities and make every effort to exact justice on those responsible for the terrorist attacks in argentina the statement said
the anti <unk> league called for a full and transparent investigation into nisman's death which it labeled another tragic episode that will extend the decades long delays in bringing the iranian <unk> and perpetrators to justice
the timing and circumstances of mr. nisman's death coming just days after he released detailed allegations of high level government attempts to evade his investigation and hours before he was scheduled to present additional details to members of the argentine congress raise serious questions about whether mr. nisman's death was related to his work on the amia bombing <unk> national director abraham <unk> said in a statement
the two time grand slam champion who retired from tennis in two thousand and fourteen chose to start spreading the news about her pregnancy at the australian open in the rod laver stadium

i think dennis is doing a good job she added before <unk> he just made one ace

she later took to facebook to talk more about her excitement at the prospect of becoming a mother
this summer dennis and i are expecting our first child
we are <unk>
she wrote
i've been feeling great and dennis and i have been doing some traveling and enjoying this special time in our lives

referring to the melbourne crowd she added
it really feels like this baby is going to enter the world already having about fifteen thousand friends
not just fifteen thousand friends there's also china's one point three billion population after <unk> sporting success made her a household name in the country of her birth
it's estimated that over one hundred million chinese watched the live tv coverage of her two thousand and eleven french open win reportedly the biggest tv audience for a single sports event in china
back at the australian open all eyes were on li after decision to announce her news at the melbourne event
i look forward to spending a few more days in australia and wish all of the players and the tournament the best of luck

dennis doyle has experienced all of the travel and exactly none of the joy
when the thirty two year old new york knicks <unk> first drummed up the plan to follow his beloved nba team at every stop including london for an entire season he had no idea it would be a historic one
sadly for him it was historic for all the wrong reasons
this is the worst basketball that i've seen this season says doyle while exiting the o two arena after the knicks were blown out by the milwaukee bucks for their sixteen th loss in a row
doyle arrived in london on saturday to watch the knicks as part of the <unk> global games initiative
i was hoping they would win close to forty games sneak into the playoffs and see what could happen he says
instead the knicks are on course to have their worst season in franchise history with a five thirty six record at the halfway mark
the failure is extreme even for a team that has battled a <unk> door of personnel changes and off court controversy for well over a decade
during the off season the knicks hired phil jackson to run its front office <unk> territory for the legendary former coach
his first move was to appoint his long serving lakers point guard derek fisher as a rookie head coach
both it appears are learning on the job at the expense of fans who pay the highest ticket prices in the league
for doyle however supporting the knicks is practically out of his hands
if it were possible i would have left the team about ten years ago he says referring to an era that included crippling player contracts along with an in house sexual harassment charge against then coach and general manager <unk> thomas
so i've given up trying to get a divorce we're stuck together
unfortunately
in london he will attend his first english premier league football match at his adopted team of tottenham hotspur on saturday
i ended up choosing the team most like the knicks doyle explains
they are from a big city but have a history of disappointment
there's something that resonated with me in that
rather than sport a lucky jersey like most super fans doyle wears an <unk> jersey <unk> <unk> number seven which he bought after the third game of the season when the knicks had a record of two one
they have won only three games and lost thirty five since
it's a tough season so we really appreciate his effort of trying to see all of our games says pablo <unk> the knicks <unk> point guard and <unk> favorite current player
you know i feel a little bit sad not only for him but for all knicks fans around the world <unk> explains
because of course we never expected this kind of season
but by now we are in the middle of deep changes so i think in the future the team will be much better
doyle who went to law school at georgetown received a pink slip from his law firm on the same day the knicks announced jackson's hire
he took it as a sign
after talking it over with his sister kelly a life coach in charlotte north carolina doyle paid three thousand five hundred dollar for a season's worth of middle tier corner seats at madison square garden and began plotting his six month odyssey
including away tickets which he paid for in advance i probably could have gotten a discount if i had waited to see how bad they are he <unk> along with flights and accommodation the experience has set him back twenty five thousand dollar
it's a crazy amount of money i understand that he says between sips of guinness at an oak infused pub in <unk> hill west london
but a lot of people in my position will travel the world
lawyers burn themselves out they take a year off and spend a good deal of money
this is my version of that
doyle who says there was an element of relief in getting fired is using the time off to hone his writing skills on his travel blog and has already signed with a book agent
a great fan of nick <unk> fever pitch he intends to write a memoir about the knicks season in the same <unk> minus the trophy ending
in some ways he sees the knicks <unk> season as a <unk> blessing in <unk>
i think it is <unk> more interesting to write about a really really bad team then to write about a <unk> team or even a really good team
he says
right away there is a certain interest a <unk> curiosity
although the knicks often trail by double figures early doyle says he tries to remain focused at least until the end of the third quarter
sometimes however the losing is just too hard to take
at a certain point it's like watching a small animal get tortured and there's no reason to continue to subject myself to that kind of pain he says
outside of the <unk> he <unk> the psychological pull of returning to life as a lawyer sometimes from the most unexpected places
in new orleans prominent personal injury attorney morris bart invited doyle to sit <unk> with him but on one condition
i had to sit and listen to him explain why i was making a mistake by leaving the practice of law says doyle who became aware that the vip experience was a subtle recruiting effort
even other extreme fans find <unk> mission <unk>
that's a lot more hardcore than i am says <unk> al <unk> a thirty five year old milwaukee bucks faithful who flew in from kuwait and spent seven hundred and fifty dollar on a floor seat to see the london game
he got fired he spent his savings watching a horrible team lose
that's a <unk> fan
nevertheless doyle admits that he'll be relieved once the season is over and doubts he'll renew his season ticket even though he thinks the knicks can become a playoff team next season
i don't think i'll be able to afford it he <unk>
there's one more reason why he's not renewing
i miss watching it on tv he says
millions of people demonstrated in condemnation of the atrocities amplified by a chorus of horror under the banner i am charlie
there were eloquent pronouncements of outrage captured well by the head of israel's labor party and the main challenger for the upcoming elections isaac <unk> who declared that terrorism is terrorism
there's no two ways about it and that all the nations that seek peace and freedom face an enormous challenge from brutal violence
the crimes also elicited a flood of commentary <unk> into the roots of these shocking assaults in islamic culture and exploring ways to counter the murderous wave of islamic terrorism without sacrificing our values
the new york times described the assault as a clash of civilizations but was corrected by times columnist <unk> <unk> who tweeted that it was not and never a war of civilizations or between them
but a war for civilization against groups on the other side of that line
<unk>
the scene in paris was described vividly in the new york times by veteran europe correspondent steven erlanger
a day of sirens helicopters in the air frantic news <unk>
of police <unk> and anxious crowds
of young children led away from schools to safety
it was a day like the previous two of blood and horror in and around paris
erlanger also quoted a surviving journalist who said that everything crashed
there was no way out
there was smoke everywhere
it was terrible
people were screaming
it was like a nightmare
another reported a huge detonation and everything went completely dark
the scene erlanger reported was an increasingly familiar one of smashed glass broken walls twisted <unk> <unk> paint and emotional devastation
these last quotes however as independent journalist david peterson reminds us are not from january two thousand and fifteen
rather they are from a report by erlanger on april twenty four one thousand nine hundred and ninety nine which received far less attention
erlanger was reporting on the nato missile attack on serbian state television headquarters that knocked radio television serbia off the air killing sixteen journalists
nato and american officials defended the attack erlanger reported as an effort to undermine the regime of president <unk> <unk> of yugoslavia
pentagon spokesman kenneth bacon told a briefing in washington that serb tv is as much a part of <unk> murder machine as his military is hence a legitimate target of attack
there were no demonstrations or cries of outrage no chants of we are rtv no inquiries into the roots of the attack in christian culture and history
on the contrary the attack on the press was lauded
the highly regarded u.s. diplomat richard <unk> then envoy to yugoslavia described the successful attack on rtv as an enormously important and i think positive development a sentiment echoed by others
there are many other events that call for no inquiry into western culture and history for example the worst single terrorist <unk> in europe in recent years in july two thousand and eleven when anders breivik a christian ultra zionist extremist and <unk> slaughtered seventy seven people mostly teenagers
also ignored in the war against terrorism is the most extreme terrorist campaign of modern times barack obama's global assassination campaign targeting people suspected of perhaps intending to harm us some day and any <unk> who happen to be nearby
other <unk> are also not lacking such as the fifty civilians reportedly killed in a u.s. led bombing raid in syria in december which was barely reported
one person was indeed punished in connection with the nato attack on rtv <unk> <unk> the general manager of the station who was sentenced by the european court of human rights to ten years in prison for failing to evacuate the building according to the committee to protect journalists
the international criminal tribunal for yugoslavia considered the nato attack <unk> that it was not a crime and although civilian casualties were unfortunately high they do not appear to be clearly disproportionate
the comparison between these cases helps us understand the condemnation of the new york times by civil rights lawyer floyd abrams famous for his forceful defense of freedom of expression
there are times for self restraint abrams wrote but in the immediate wake of the most threatening assault on journalism in living memory the times editors would have served the cause of free expression best by engaging in it by publishing the charlie hebdo cartoons <unk> mohammed that elicited the assault
abrams is right in describing the charlie hebdo attack as the most threatening assault on journalism in living memory
the reason has to do with the concept living memory a category carefully constructed to include their crimes against us while <unk> excluding our crimes against them the latter not crimes but noble defense of the highest values sometimes inadvertently flawed
this is not the place to inquire into just what was being defended when rtv was attacked but such an inquiry is quite informative
there are many other illustrations of the interesting category living memory
one is provided by the marine assault against fallujah in november two thousand and four one of the worst crimes of the u.s. uk invasion of iraq
the assault opened with occupation of fallujah general hospital a major war crime quite apart from how it was carried out
the crime was reported prominently on the front page of the new york times accompanied with a photograph depicting how patients and hospital employees were rushed out of rooms by armed soldiers and ordered to sit or lie on the floor while troops tied their hands behind their backs
the occupation of the hospital was considered <unk> and justified
it shut down what officers said was a propaganda weapon for the militants
fallujah general hospital with its stream of reports of civilian casualties
<unk> this is no assault on free expression and does not qualify for entry into living memory
there are other questions
one would naturally ask how france <unk> freedom of expression and the sacred principles of fraternity freedom solidarity
for example is it through the <unk> law repeatedly implemented which effectively grants the state the right to determine historical truth and punish <unk> from its <unk>
by <unk> miserable descendants of holocaust survivors to bitter persecution in eastern europe
by the <unk> treatment of north african immigrants in the banlieues of paris where the charlie hebdo terrorists became jihadis
when the courageous journal charlie hebdo fired the cartoonist sin on grounds that a comment of his was deemed to have anti semitic connotations
many more questions quickly arise
anyone with eyes open will quickly notice other rather striking <unk>
thus prominent among those who face an enormous challenge from brutal violence are palestinians once again during israel's vicious assault on gaza in the summer of two thousand and fourteen in which many journalists were murdered sometimes in well marked press cars along with thousands of others while the israeli run outdoor prison was again reduced to rubble on <unk> that collapse instantly on examination
also ignored was the assassination of three more journalists in latin america in december bringing the number for the year to thirty one
there have been more than a dozen journalists killed in honduras alone since the military coup of two thousand and nine that was effectively recognized by the u.s. probably according post coup honduras the per capita championship for murder of journalists
but again not an assault on freedom of press within living memory
it is not difficult to elaborate
these few examples illustrate a very general principle that is observed with impressive dedication and consistency
the more we can blame some crimes on enemies the greater the outrage
the greater our responsibility for crimes and hence the more we can do to end them the less the concern tending to <unk> or even denial
contrary to the eloquent pronouncements it is not the case that terrorism is terrorism
there's no two ways about it
there definitely are two ways about it
theirs versus ours
and not just terrorism
more from <unk>
two thousand and thirteen
israel's west bank plans will leave palestinians very little
the <unk> region is among the oldest industrial areas in the world and in its heyday of the seventeen th and eighteen th centuries it was home to around six hundred active windmills
at the <unk> <unk> among its wooden <unk> houses and museums just ten windmills are still in operation <unk> oil <unk> and <unk>
one of these historic windmills is de kat meaning the cat which uses wind power to create <unk> for paint
the listed building has a rich history
first built between one thousand six hundred and forty six and one thousand six hundred and ninety six the <unk> survived a fire in one thousand seven hundred and eighty two and a body rebuild in the one thousand nine hundred and seventy s
<unk> kempenaar the miller at de kat has been working with windmills for over thirty years
every day he stands on the <unk> platform as <unk> have done for centuries looking at the sky and feeling the power of the elements
you must have a special kind of feeling for this technology kempenaar says
kempenaar has to pay close attention to the wind because it dictates the day's work
each part of the mill from the wings to the tail can be adjusted and tweaked to make the most of the wind that day
sometimes you hear a sound and it's a problem with a bearing
sometimes you listen to the waves on the water and you say oh boy the wind has changed direction
de kat is a fully functioning paint mill
when the wind is strong it turns three thousand kilogram granite stones which grind down <unk> into a fine powder and pack it with <unk>
the weight of the stones are enormous and powered by the <unk> energy in the world kempenaar says
the breeze of the lord
this natural process is nothing new
it goes back to the area's roots
the whole industrial revolution was born here explains kempenaar
it was all coming by <unk> the main port of the world the main port of europe for three hundred years so many boats were arriving in the harbor of <unk> on the coast loaded with raw materials and needed an industrial process
windmills are a passion kempenaar has had since he started his studies as a miller in one thousand nine hundred and seventy eight and he'll continue to preserve this art for as long as the wind continues to blow and as long as the <unk> <unk> continue to preserve this reminder of the dutch golden age

by showing students as young as six how robots can solve real world problems fundi bots founder <unk> king benge wants young people to develop a creative skill set they can apply to solve issues specific to their lives
we have a team in northern uganda building an automated farming program explains thirty two year old king benge
the project includes an irrigation system for crops and also a temperature monitoring solution to make sure
cow feed doesn't <unk> and go bad
the students are also working on an automatic seed <unk> to feed pigs
in a country where over ninety percents of primary school aged children are enrolled in classes according to world bank data fundi bots first focuses on <unk> time slots in schools
as well as presentations and video based learning fundi bots also offers hands on robotics training and helps keen students form weekly robotics clubs
the initiative has taken off in fifteen schools spread across the capital kampala and <unk> in the north where experienced mentors visit once or twice a month to offer ideas and encouragement
but tinkering with robotic parts and coming up with new ideas carries on after school too
during holiday camps students are taught robotic concepts and then given time to implement that learning by building a robot by the end of the camp
central to the fundi bots philosophy is that building robots does not require a fortune
students are encouraged to use recycled materials or components like laser pointers and microphones that were never originally designed to be a robotic building block
one group of thirteen and fourteen year olds is creating a small remote controlled vehicle with a temperature reader on the front that could be used in fire risk areas king benge explains
their idea uses a wireless transmitter which sends data back in real time but they managed to keep costs quite low at around one hundred and thirty dollar by using locally sourced materials like wheels from toy cars
while the physical components may not command high prices the skills students gain in the process could prove lucrative
according to <unk> <unk> the global market for robotics amounted to twenty five point eight billion dollar in june two thousand and fourteen and is expected to grow to more than seventy billion dollar by two thousand and twenty
while the fundi bots program is showing initial signs of having an impact in uganda king benge says that's just the start
fundi bots is based in uganda but our five year mandate is to build a presence in five african countries by the end of two thousand and twenty explains king benge
the most promising country at the moment is rwanda because the government is very forward thinking and very keen to develop as the <unk> powerhouse in the region
fundi bots which held a workshop in rwanda last october might be the first robotics teaching program in uganda but it is not the only one of its kind in africa
the african robotics network was established in ghana in april two thousand and twelve to improve education around robotics
one way the group has worked on this goal is by organizing the week long ashesi robotics experience
it was during this set of workshops that a participant developed the <unk> a basic mini explorer robot which can navigate obstacles and learn about its surroundings
the robot which uses <unk> <unk> <unk> in the design can be built from scratch for a total cost of just eight dollar <unk>
the enthusiasm of the kids is incredible says <unk> <unk> assistant computer science professor at ashesi university college and co founder of the african robotics network
recognizing that a robot can be made from familiar items like a computer mouse or game controller really <unk> robotics and electronics for them
robots are also playing a more prominent role in kinshasa the capital of the democratic republic of congo
eight feet tall robotic traffic <unk> designed and built by a team of local engineers have been recording and controlling traffic twenty four hours a day for just less than a year
as the ugandan students learn new ways to build robots king benge says there's no limit to what could emerge from the workshops and retreats
when i see the students coming up with innovative ideas i really see minds are being changed
students are being exposed to the creative process and i look forward to seeing them come up with bigger projects in five or ten years time

the hunt is still on for the ringleader behind a terrorist cell targeted in raids last week belgium's justice minister said
the suspected leader and key link between senior isis operatives in syria and the belgian terrorist cell belgian moroccan isis fighter <unk> abaaoud is still at large a senior belgian counterterrorism official said
abaaoud's last known location was believed to be greece the official said
an algerian national who may have links to abaaoud was arrested over the weekend in greece and is being extradited to belgium
the man detained by belgian police after last week's raid has been identified
his attorney says he isn't a terrorist
he was just delivering shoes to a friend when he was caught in the wrong place at the wrong time
but investigators believe the man played a key role in the terrorist <unk> plot the belgian counterterrorism official said
investigators are looking for a man whose dna was found on a gun magazine used by amedy coulibaly who killed four hostages at a kosher supermarket in paris
sales of counterfeit goods by charlie hebdo attacker cherif kouachi helped fund the purchase of weapons a source familiar with the ongoing investigation in france told cnn
five belgian nationals have been charged with participation in a terrorist organization in connection with last week's raid in verviers federal prosecutor eric van der sypt said
the terror cell planned to target police officers he said
belgian counterterrorism agencies think the suspected ringleader of the cell is likely abaaoud the senior belgian counterterrorism official said
according to guy van vlierden a reporter at the belgian newspaper hln who tracks belgian foreign fighters in syria for the blog <unk> abaaoud is a twenty seven year old from the molenbeek district of brussels who traveled to syria in january two thousand and fourteen and joined isis soon afterward
the two gunmen killed in the verviers raid belgians of north african descent from the same brussels district were in phone contact with an isis ringleader in greece who belgian authorities believe was likely abaaoud
but belgian authorities have not ruled out the possibility that an algerian suspect arrested in greece over the weekend was the key link between the terror cell and isis
that thirty three year old suspect was wanted in belgium on charges of terrorist activity greek police said monday
belgium is requesting an extradition
and greece isn't done yet
police there say they have made multiple arrests and are looking for more suspects
other countries are also helping belgium <unk> suspected jihadists
french authorities captured two suspects as they were trying to cross from france into italy van der sypt said
four days after police raided a suspected terror cell in verviers belgium killing two people who authorities said were part of a terrorist cell on the brink of a major attack we now know the name of the surviving suspect
marouane el bali was taken into custody and faces charges of participation in a terrorist organization and possession of explosives with intent to commit a criminal attack among other charges said his attorney didier de quvy
but de quvy said his client was not involved in any terrorism
he went to verviers to see his fiance and was dropping off a pair of sneakers de quvy said
he did not know that these guys were connected to international terrorism
he arrived he sat down and the moment he sat down the policemen starting shooting
he managed to escape by jumping out the window
the other two however took their guns and responded and got killed
authorities say it wasn't just a case of being in the wrong place at the wrong time
investigators believe el bali played a key role in the terrorist <unk> plot and was a key <unk> between two dead gunmen and a wider network in brussels the senior belgian counterterrorism official said
el bali is also believed to have fought with isis in syria at some point
there are still concerns that part of the terror cell remains at large in belgium and could take revenge for the death of their comrades the senior counterterrorism official said
belgian security services suspect around ten people were involved in the cell but they don't know the number for sure and that worries them
belgian counterterrorism officials believe the cell had ambitious attack plans beyond attacking police given bomb making chemicals found in their safe house in verviers and police uniforms
they also suspect terrorists were plotting multiple attacks
the belief is that the cell has now been disrupted and will take some time to get back on its feet
the wider cell was being monitored for less than two months
over the last several weeks belgian security services started monitoring the verviers group twenty four seven
why did police move in last week
one reason the official said is that the cell obtained weapons and belgian police could not continue round the clock surveillance indefinitely
investigators say dna found in a car used to transport jewish market attack gunman coulibaly has been traced to a man who is already in custody in connection with the attacks according to a source familiar with the ongoing investigation
investigators are still looking for a person whose dna was found on a magazine for coulibaly's gun
coulibaly is the gunman who killed four hostages on january nine at a kosher grocery store in paris before police killed him
before the siege he had proclaimed his allegiance to the islamic state in iraq and syria or isis
the assault happened during three days of terror in france that began with the attack on offices of the charlie hebdo satirical newspaper in paris
in all twelve people died in the charlie hebdo attack on january seven
al qaeda in the arabian peninsula al qaeda's yemen affiliate claimed responsibility for the charlie hebdo shootings
on monday cnn affiliate bfmtv reported charlie hebdo cartoonist laurent <unk> will succeed editor stephane charbonnier who died in the attack
although french officials said they thought cherif kouachi had given up terror related activities and moved to end surveillance on him after he began selling counterfeit goods it turns out the proceeds from those sales were being used to buy weapons a source familiar with the ongoing investigation in france told cnn
that's just one of several missteps by intelligence agencies in france being revealed by the investigation into the attacks the source said
other <unk> include a lack of communication and delays in circulating information according to the source
in one case a french surveillance agency received an alert about one of the kouachi brothers phones in february two thousand and fourteen but it took four months for information to be passed on to the country's main domestic spy agency the source said
by then neither brother was under surveillance the source said
the surveillance on cherif kouachi ended in november two thousand and <unk> the surveillance on said kouachi the older brother ended in june sources have told cnn
also authorities now say they think both said and cherif kouachi traveled to yemen in two thousand and eleven via oman even though <unk> passport had been confiscated in two thousand and ten
however investigators have been unable to find either brother's name in travel databases according to the source
the shenzhen evening news issued an apology on sunday on their official <unk> weibo account a widely used chinese social media site confirming the incident
we sincerely apologize for the disturbance and discomfort we have caused to <unk> family fans and <unk> the statement read
the newspaper admitted to taking photos of the thirty three year old's body during a <unk> removal surgery in a operating room after her death on friday evening at a shenzhen hospital
she had agreed to donate her <unk> after her death
according to the statement the photos were deleted immediately after family members objected
yao is a pop star known for singing the chinese version of let it go from <unk> <unk>
she first rose to fame in china's hit reality television singing competition the voice in two thousand and thirteen
allegations of the incident surfaced on social media a day after the news of the thirty three year old's death broke
a widely shared post on weibo under the user name entertainment whistleblower said that three journalists from the shenzhen evening news pretended to be medical staff assisting in the surgery and <unk> into the morgue to take photographs of the deceased <unk> body
the statement from the newspaper did not say how many journalists were involved or detail exactly how the photos were obtained
cnn contacted the hospital about the allegations but they had no comment on the incident
the allegations unleashed a storm of criticism about media ethics on social media
where is your humanity
commented one weibo user referring to the newspaper
a simple apology online and that's all you're going to do about an incident that seriously <unk> ethical borders
said another
but that's not the way cubans see things
they regard many facets of daily life as falling into a gray area open to their own selective interpretation at least until the authorities catch up with them
that was the case when i decided to join ninety three year old <unk> torrente on a trip to the outskirts of havana to a cockfighting arena
on paper this was a privately operated underground venue <unk> and unregulated by the cuban state
for a semi clandestine event it was clear plenty of people seemed to know about it
as i picked my way down a short dirt track and past a couple of tethered <unk> i heard voices shouting and what sounded like scores of <unk> <unk>
in front of a metal gate two men barred my way
there's a problem they said
i assumed they were referring to the camera gear in my hands or the fact i was a foreigner
entrance fee will cost you seventy five <unk> they said
that's the equivalent of about three u.s. dollars more than half a week's salary for a cuban state worker
but for me it was the price of passage into the twilight world of many ordinary cubans where rules are never quite what they seem
on the other side of the gate one of the first people i ran into was the event organizer
not allowed but not really forbidden
well this definitely isn't permitted but i don't really think it's forbidden he said laughing and explaining he'd been staging <unk> every saturday for the last fourteen years
many fans of the <unk> had told me stories of how they had been at fights that had been raided by the police and were forced to run away to avoid arrest
when i asked this organizer how he had managed to sidestep sanctions for so long he <unk> and placed two fingers on his shoulder a hint he was <unk> a contact in the security services to turn a blind eye
talking about official corruption however is highly <unk> upon as well as bad for his business so i made my way <unk> without further questions
the cockpit and small <unk> stands were made of welded scraps of rusty metal
not elegant but highly effective
about two hundred men and a handful of women and children were clinging to the bars cheering on their favored rooster as it <unk> and scrapped in a <unk> circle
my guide for the day <unk> torrente who lives miles away in <unk> old havana quickly filled me in on tactics
it's part technique and part luck he said
in fact it's mostly luck
it's a bit like life itself
if you were born to win then you'll win
but if you were born to lose it doesn't matter how good you are you'll end up like this he said flapping his arm and simulating the death of a rooster
i'd met torrente a few days earlier as i searched for a barber's shop
the salon was closed but torrente sat nearby <unk> the belly feathers off one of the four fighting <unk> he is currently <unk>
his birds are still too young and too <unk>
he's feeding them corn and putting them on a strict training routine
but on the saturday afternoon i joined him he had no direct stake in the fights
cockfighting itself may be somewhat a gray area the letter of the law appears to permit a handful state run events at venues where health and safety measures are enforced but bans private events like the one i was at
but cuban law seems unequivocal in declaring gambling illegal
prior to fidel castro's one thousand nine hundred and fifty nine revolution the u.s. mafia controlled <unk> and prostitution in cuba
thanks to the income from those rackets the <unk> also had a say in how government was run
the <unk> law book somehow seemed to have been <unk> here on the outskirts of havana
<unk> shouted across the arena and <unk> hand signs at one another offering odds to any takers
when one rooster collapsed in a bloodied heap and the other was <unk> victorious small <unk> of <unk> changed hands
on the sidelines of the <unk> a man running a dice game on a green <unk> table invited me take to a photo
he quickly <unk> the offer when i reminded him dice games and gambling were illegal
you can't get rid of cockfighting it's part of cuban culture
it's the sport of the common people one prize <unk> owner who gave him name as <unk> told me
beyond the question of legality it's clear cockfighting is a passion for some in cuba like in other parts of latin america
torrente told me he grew up in western cuba alongside a cockpit
ever since i was born there was a cockfighting arena near my house
the <unk> would come on their horse to the fights
i used to love that he said
torrente's father died when he was just a boy
his uncle antonio paid for his upbringing
his uncle left cuba in the early one thousand nine hundred and twenty s for new york and worked as a traveling pharmaceutical salesman
uncle antonio used to send a check back to torrente's mother every month
and when torrente was twelve in the early one thousand nine hundred and thirty s his uncle sent for him and put him into school in new york
by his own admission torrente learned nothing and was an appalling student
he remembers swimming in the hudson river when he should have been in class
his uncle sent him back to havana after a year
they told my uncle not to waste any more of his money on my education
it wasn't worth it torrente explained
by the time the cuban revolution came torrente says his uncle had purchased six or seven buildings in havana as an investment
he had also gifted a barber's shop to torrente who took up the trade
but castro and his rebels stripped wealthy <unk> <unk> like torrente's uncle antonio of his property and <unk> some of it among society's poorest
torrente was left with a single apartment where he's lived for the last sixty years
three of his own children decided to leave cuba and head to the united states
but torrente says he refused to go for a very simple reason
cockfighting was illegal in the united states
i didn't want to go he said
when it boils down to it i think life revolves around just three things
women cockfighting and boxing he said
in cuba he had all three
torrente is clearly no fan of cuba's socialist system
it seemed that when the revolution took place everything was going to change and get better
but for me and many others it didn't
they took away my barber's shop
they took my <unk> buildings
now i get just nine dollar pension a month he said
then he gently placed his index finger on the tip of his tongue
but you can't speak too much about that he said reflecting the <unk> of an older generations of cubans not to openly voice criticism of the government to strangers
with u.s. president barack obama's december announcement to work towards normalization of ties with an old cold war foe torrente is hopeful
he says he doubts he will live to see the cuban government returning the property it <unk> from his uncle
but the easing of trade and travel restrictions will make it easier for his three children and grandchildren to come back and forth to visit from florida
the changes will also allow his relatives if they can afford it to send higher value remittances to fund him in his retirement
funding his retirement of course means funding his <unk> passion for fighting <unk>
on sunny days torrente places his four raucous <unk> in separate small <unk> outside on the sidewalk
and while he is surely hoping for a thaw in u.s. cuba relations he's reserving his biggest hope for a young rooster he calls painted indian
torrente sets him on a rusty kitchen scale holds up three fingers and says
he weighs three pounds
maybe in six months he'll be ready
i think he's going to be a great fighter
the girl was caught in the early hours of december twenty three at a staircase known as the lennon wall leading to the central government offices in the city's admiralty district and was detained by police for seventeen hours
they then applied to have the girl taken into care
i can understand why the police made the application she told journalists outside the court monday according to local media
after reading the social <unk> report i find that it is not necessary to grant the child protection order at this stage
reports of the arrest and the care and protection order application attracted widespread criticism among protestors as such applications are usually made by the social welfare department not the police and are usually made in cases where a child is at risk
when an application for a care and protection order is made the social welfare department is expected to produce a report assessing the needs and the care of the children or <unk> involved
a spokesperson from the social welfare department told cnn that all court cases in hong kong are open however a court can decide not to disclose information in cases where the identity of a minor needs to be protected
the spokesperson added that the department's integrated family service center would continue to monitor the case and provide the appropriate support and services to the girl and her family
but gary <unk> who participated in hong kong's pro democracy street occupations told cnn earlier this month that the teen was an innocent political prisoner and the use of the law in this case was obviously politically motivated
street becomes canvas for silent protest in hong kong
the lennon wall became a focal point for messages of support for the recent pro democracy protests in hong kong
when the protests were cleared the messages hundreds of post it notes were removed as well
protesters started placing notes on the wall as a show of defiance after police used tear gas on demonstrators at the start of the protest which led to a two month occupation of the main road outside the central government office
the wall was named after the late beatles star john lennon and contained messages of support for the protests and references to his song imagine
the girl widely known as <unk> girl told local newspaper ming <unk> daily earlier this month that she did not regret getting involved with the protests and urged activists not to give up
last week police withdrew an application for a care and protection order for a fourteen year old boy last week
the boy was arrested during the police clear out of the <unk> <unk> protest site last year
the court file said the boy's parents failed to exercise proper <unk> over him
a small protest camp outside the legislative council still remains and there is a small police presence on the site
police officers are <unk> lennon wall and remove all notes posted to it at the end of each day
since the protest sites were cleared demonstrators have resorted to other forms of protest such as the so called shopping revolution which involves protestors blocking the sidewalks and flooding shopping districts every night with yellow <unk>
thirty protest leaders including the three founders of occupy central with love and peace and several prominent student leaders have been called by the police to report to the police headquarters in wan <unk> district where they could possibly be arrested and prosecuted for their involvement with the two month long protest
hong kong police have not responded to requests for comment

after all nadal last competed at a major at wimbledon and had lost both singles matches that he contested this year as he returned from <unk> surgery
nadal who also suffered from back and wrist injuries in two thousand and fourteen cast doubt on his australian open participation just last week
<unk> too owned four victories over the fourteen time grand slam champion
but in a score that is sure to have his rivals taking note the spaniard crushed the former top ten regular six three six two six two
very positive result for me nadal told reporters
i think very good start
always before the first match you have the doubts especially in this situation i'm arriving here
never easy but it was an important match for me
was a comfortable victory that give me some confidence
nadal <unk> <unk> on court even when he wins in straight sets but he needed just one hour fifty minutes to <unk> of the veteran russian
he only faced one break point dropped four points behind his first serve and struck twenty two more winners than unforced errors

my return worked really well
the serve too
i served i think the right way with only one break point during the whole match
and in general i played with not many mistakes
nadal could face roger federer in the semifinals and the swiss began his charge with a six four six two seven five win over <unk> <unk> lu
lu has upset the likes of andy murray andy <unk> and david <unk> in the past but he only really challenged the seventeen time grand slam winner in the third set
an attacking federer appearing in a record extending sixty one st straight major approached the net more than forty times winning seventy percents of those points
nadal and federer were joined in the second round by two time grand slam winner murray although an outside contender for the women's draw ana ivanovic fell
there was a time when many thought the former no
one would never return to the top ten and top five but two thousand and thirteen and two thousand and fourteen saw the serb re climb the rankings
and last week she extended maria sharapova to three sets in a final in brisbane
her goal in two thousand and fifteen she said was to perform her best at the grand slams yet monday's one six six three six two loss to czech qualifier <unk> <unk> means she still hasn't figured things out
ivanovic heavily contributed to her downfall hitting ten double <unk>
it's now only one grand slam quarterfinal for ivanovic in her past nine attempts
it's really disappointing ivanovic told reporters
it's probably the worst thing that could happen
i really have to now sit and work on few things and just maybe try to have a different approach to this kind of event and try to see what was lacking
ivanovic admitted to nerves prior to the encounter as did third seed <unk> halep ahead of her match against <unk> <unk>
but the fast rising halep overcame the nerves and eased past the italian six three six two
sharapova bidding for a first major outside the french open in seven years defeated petra <unk> six four six one
<unk> reward is a second round clash with <unk> <unk> <unk> who snapped a long drought at her home major
having lost all nine of her previous matches in melbourne the big serving <unk> ousted <unk> fellow romanian alexandra <unk> six three six four
i was talking to my coach and i told him i actually did feel like i won the australian open <unk> said
it was just the first round but it's been such a long time coming
not to be able to do it in your home grand slam was very devastating for me
later there was more joy for australia as two of its brightest prospects won five <unk>

there are many children neglected by their own parents glyzelle said sunday at a ceremony at a four hundred year old catholic university in manila
there are also many who became victims and many terrible things happened to them like drugs or prostitution
why is god allowing such things to happen even if it is not the fault of the children
she asked the pope breaking down into tears as she spoke
another former street child jun <unk> told pope francis about his struggle to survive without a home
i was feeding myself with what i can find in the garbage said jun fourteen
i did not know where to go and i was sleeping on the sidewalk
when i was in the street i witness also things i don't like terrible things that happened to my companions in the street jun said
i saw that they were taught how to steal to kill also and they have no respect anymore for the adults
pope francis responded to <unk> question and <unk> testimony by giving the two children a big hug
she is the only one who has put a question for which there is no answer and she wasn't even able to express it in words but in tears the seventy eight year old pope told the crowd
glyzelle and jun are both in the care of <unk> ng <unk> foundation a non governmental organization that looks after manila's street children
the foundation came across glyzelle and her older sister a few years ago said alexandra chapeleau the group's communication manager
the girls had left home where their impoverished parents were unable to support them or get them an education and were fending for themselves on the street she said
they first attended one of the foundation's drop in centers before moving into a residential facility and starting to attend school
in november their younger brother joined them at the foundation
glyzelle is still in touch with her mother and goes home to see her at christmas chapeleau said
the foundation's center where glyzelle lives is home to about forty other former street children
most of them are victims of the terrible things that can happen in the street including physical and sexual abuse chapeleau said
but <unk> tears in front of the pope on sunday were apparently prompted by the intensity of the moment not because of her own experiences
she asked the question on behalf of all the children we take care of not because of something personal regarding her own story chapeleau said
the pope touched on the street children theme again later sunday when he celebrated mass in a manila park with millions of people despite the <unk> rain
we need to see each child as a gift to be welcomed cherished and protected he told the enormous crowd
and we need to care for our young not allowing them to be condemned to a life on the streets
the pope had visited the center where glyzelle and others live on friday after celebrating mass at manila cathedral and reportedly said he was very moved by what he saw
there are estimated to be more than one point five million street children in the philippines about seventy thousand of them in the manila metropolitan area according to the he cares foundation another group that cares for them
in his account jun described seeing some of his friends sniffing glue and taking other drugs
he said he learned to be wary of adults offering money or help because it was often a trap to exploit the children
he initially declined an offer of support from <unk> ng <unk> foundation but later found out that the organization was genuinely trying to help him
i realized that not all people have no heart he said
the pope left the philippines on monday waving as he boarded his plane at the end of an asia trip that also included time in sri lanka
in the first visit by a pope to the predominantly catholic philippines in twenty years francis paid a visit to tacloban the city ravaged by super typhoon haiyan in november two thousand and thirteen
francis had to cut short his time there at the weekend because of the approach of another typhoon
but it didn't stop him from donning a slicker to celebrate mass in tacloban on saturday for hundreds of thousands who gathered despite the stormy weather

police said gamers in the caf continued as if nothing happened even when the police and paramedics arrived
the cctv footage from the internet cafe showed that he had a small struggle before he collapsed motionless said wu
cold temperatures and over exhaustion from the long hours spent playing games likely contributed to hsieh's cardiac arrest a police statement said
according to the taipei times the man was a regular customer who often played for consecutive days
when tired he would sleep face down on the table or <unk> off slumped in his chair the staff member was quoted as saying
that is why we were not aware of his condition in the beginning

so says a new report which estimates that the richest one percents will have as much wealth as the other ninety nine percents combined by next year
the richest one percents have seen their share of global wealth increase from forty four percents in two thousand and nine to forty eight percents in two thousand and fourteen oxfam says in a report monday
at that rate the wealthiest will own more than fifty percents by next year according to the report
do we really want to live in a world where the one percents own more than the rest of us combined
asked <unk> <unk> executive director of the international aid agency
<unk> will co chair the annual world economic forum in davos this week
she plans to use the platform at davos to call for urgent action on the rising inequality
the eighty richest people on the planet have the same wealth as the poorest three point five billion people the report says
the scale of global inequality is quite simply staggering
and despite the issues shooting up the global agenda the gap between the richest and the rest is widening fast she said
it is time our leaders took on the powerful vested interests that stand in the way of a <unk> and more prosperous world
while one percents of the population owns forty eight percents of the world's wealth a majority of the remainder follows the same trend
of the remaining fifty two percents of global wealth forty six percents is owned by the rest of the richest fifth of the world's population the report says
the remainder of the population only possesses five point five percents of global wealth

that news came after fighting around the presidential palace and came after yemen's prime minister went into hiding when attackers shot at him
nine people were killed and sixty seven others injured <unk> the clashes yemen's health ministry said
the yemeni government a u.s. ally in the battle against al qaeda described the fighting as a power grab by rebels known as houthis shiite muslims who have long felt marginalized in the majority sunni country
turmoil between the two sides is worrisome to the west because a power vacuum in yemen could benefit al qaeda in the arabian peninsula a terrorist organization based in yemen that took credit for the attack on the offices of charlie hebdo in paris
it also tried to blow up a plane landing in detroit in two thousand and nine
a houthi <unk> ali <unk> told cnn that the presidential committee had agreed to a deal after hours of negotiations
interior minister <unk> al <unk> also confirmed the ceasefire had been reached
there are conflicting accounts of the cause of the clashes
government officials characterize it as a power grab by the houthis
houthis say yemen's military attacked people demanding that authorities lift road closures introduced as a security measure after the presidential chief of staff was abducted in sanaa a few days ago
a western diplomat in sanaa told cnn the situation was complex
today's events appear to be the next stage in houthi plans to extend their control in yemen
but there are many players with many agendas
so this hasn't finished playing out the diplomat said
it is unclear who fired first near the presidential palace monday
control of the palace is seen as key to the control of the country
there were reports of government buildings a hospital and residential buildings being hit
the presidential palace is controlled by the government and <unk> surrounding the palace are held by rebels known as houthis a senior interior ministry official told cnn late monday
both sides will remain where they are until a deal is signed which is expected to happen tuesday said the official
the yemeni information minister told cnn's christiane amanpour that government control is almost nonexistent
when asked to described the situation on the ground nadia al sakkaf said
this is almost a replica of what happened in september on the twenty one st of september when the houthis came into the city and took over everything and then there was the peace and partnership agreement where they pulled back a little bit and allowed a government to be created
now since then the houthis have not really left the capital
they've been around with their arms and what happened is that they've been interfering in the government's work but we were trying to get this country going the minister said
the u.n. security council will hold a special meeting to discuss yemen on tuesday
prime minister khaled bahah was fired upon when he left a meeting with president abd <unk> <unk> hadi and the houthi political group <unk> al sakkaf said
bahah was unharmed and is now in hiding she said
he is at his place but currently he has been surrounded by houthi militias around his place and they have stationed themselves at <unk> of neighboring buildings
he is worried that the situation might escalate said the minister
the senior interior ministry official said the prime minister was inside the republican palace some seven miles from the presidential palace
the gunfire came from a houthi checkpoint near the meeting place and the attempt to kill the prime minister was a breach on an earlier ceasefire al sakkaf said
but a senior houthi official condemned the attack and denied the group had anything to do with it blaming the attempt on an unnamed third party
houthis said their convoy had also been fired upon after leaving the talks
adding to the disputes the information minister said yemeni state tv and the state run <unk> news agency are now under the control of the houthi political movement
but senior houthi official ali <unk> denied the movement controlled either news outlet
there are concerns that as yemen <unk> into greater sectarian violence al qaeda a predominantly sunni group will gain an even greater foothold there with more recruits and a base from which to attack other targets
this morning it was so chaotic
they said that nobody knew what was going on and who was in charge and these are situations where al qaeda can easily infiltrate and create al sakkaf told cnn
al qaeda in the arabian peninsula has its home in yemen where in recent months it has come under pressure from houthi rebels and government forces
but the charlie hebdo attack may show the group's apparent ability to direct operations beyond yemen's borders
it is thought likely that one or both of the brothers behind the attack in paris visited yemen and received weapons training from aqap and that one may have met with the group's former leader
a u.s. official said the united states was monitoring the violence monday and had sufficient military power nearby to evacuate its embassy on short notice if needed
al sakkaf said gunmen linked to the houthi political movement attacked the presidential palace in a bid to take control of the symbol of power
hadi the president was not in the building and is safe al sakkaf said but government officials were among an unknown number of casualties
houthi rebels claimed responsibility saturday for the abduction of presidential chief of staff ahmed bin mubarak
al sakkaf said monday's dispute began when the government tried to implement a security plan as it feared more <unk> of key staff
but a top houthi official said houthis tried to <unk> with the army and asked for roads to be opened for citizens which led to their people getting attacked
he said they then had to defend themselves
hadi appointed bin mubarak as premier in october but the rebels rejected the nomination
osama sari senior media adviser to the houthi movement in yemen said the houthis had detained bin mubarak as a message to the president
it was because the president wanted to introduce a new constitution without the approval of the houthis sari said
the abduction came amid increased tensions in the arabian peninsula country after the rise of shiite houthi rebels
houthis swept into the capital last year sparking battles that left more than three hundred dead in a month
in september houthis signed a ceasefire deal with the government
since then its members have installed themselves in key positions in the government and financial institutions
hadi was elected president in february two thousand and twelve
he was the only candidate on the ballot
after four months of exciting <unk> action america has its super bowl combatants
the seattle seahawks will face off against the new england patriots in super bowl xlix on february one in <unk> arizona
whether you're a hardcore nfl fan or just a wannabe watching the game for the halftime show and commercials here are five things you need to know for the super bowl
this will only be the eleven th time that the no
one team from the nfc will play the no
one team from afc
and this matchup of no
one seeds is happening for the second year in a row
usually one of the top teams <unk> its toe in the playoffs on the way to super bowl glory
winning the big prize twice is just plain hard to do
just ask barack obama
but if the seahawks succeed in winning another championship in two weeks they will be the first repeat nfl <unk> in a decade
no team has done that since
the new england patriots in two thousand and five
speaking of the pats the bill belichick tom brady era in new england has been nothing short of phenomenal
the coach <unk> <unk> has produced three super bowl wins twelve division championships and a record of one hundred and eighty fifty five together
but there's more history to be made
belichick now the <unk> coach in nfl <unk> history with twenty one wins will become only the second coach to appear in six super bowls while brady will become the only quarterback to play in six super bowls
after this year's title tilt the nfl will break with tradition and ditch using roman <unk> in the super bowl name
the two thousand and sixteen version of the championship game the fifty th to be played in the san francisco forty nine ers <unk> stadium will simply be known as super bowl fifty
the roman <unk> are set to return in two thousand and seventeen for super bowl li
some folks don't care about the game at all
they'll be watching to see who's performing at halftime
after many years of halftime shows featuring a musical <unk> of singers and groups the nfl seems to have found a winner with shows focused on a single artist
think of the great super bowl halftime shows put on by prince bruce <unk> and beyonce
and bruno mars simply set the stage on fire last year
this year get ready to roar with katy perry and she's bringing in lenny kravitz for backup
<unk> <unk> will sing the national anthem
oh and for those keeping up with such things the early las vegas line on the super bowl has seattle as a slight favorite over new england
but that's subject to change during the next two weeks of <unk> buildup to the game
most of those released saturday were children and the elderly said <unk> jabari the kurdistan democratic party leader
once they were freed they walked up to a peshmerga checkpoint southwest of the city of kirkuk according to jabari
they are now under the care of kurdish authorities
yazidis are among iraq's smallest minorities
they are of kurdish descent and their religion is considered a pre islamic sect that draws from christianity judaism and <unk>
one of the oldest religious communities in the world they have long suffered persecution with many muslims referring to them as devil <unk>
the militant group isis which calls itself the islamic state <unk> into iraq's north last year forcing hundreds of thousands of minorities from their homes
the u.s. state department estimates that five hundred thousand yazidis live in northern iraq accounting for less than one percents of the country's population
the airbus a three hundred six hundred st popularly known as the beluga because of its resemblance to the white arctic whale is the european plane <unk> super sized transporter jet
five of these enormous planes make more than sixty flights each week carrying parts for all of airbus planes from manufacturing sites wings in the uk <unk> in spain for example to the final assembly facilities in either toulouse hamburg or <unk>
the planes have been in service since one thousand nine hundred and ninety four but are in need of <unk>
since the plane's inaugural flight <unk> production rates have increased five fold so a new fleet is planned to keep up with demand especially with the new a three hundred and fifty xwb plane now entering service
the need for the new beluga comes with the increase in production rates and to get extra capacity on top of this fleet of five <unk> says stephane gosselin head of airbus transport international
so initially there will be a mixed fleet use of both new beluga and old beluga
and then the second need was as well to anticipate replacement of an aging fleet
a crew of three operates the beluga
two pilots and a <unk>
because of its size the plane reacts differently to other large jets in turbulence
moving sideways more than up and down
the five <unk> currently in operation are actually airbus a three hundred six hundred jets that have been modified to carry large cargo
the top section of the aircraft was cut and an additional wider fuselage section <unk> a bubble was added to the <unk> giving it its characteristic hump
the cockpit was lowered making it possible for the cargo hold to be loaded and unloaded through the front of the aircraft
the result is an incredibly <unk> cargo hold of one thousand four hundred cubic meters
that's the equivalent to six hundred and seventy one people thirty six cars or seven elephants
the perception you have is of a huge volume like a cathedral says gosselin
although the <unk> maximum payload of forty seven tons is surpassed by a handful of other cargo aircraft its <unk> hold makes it suitable for transporting oversized but not particularly heavy cargo like aircraft parts

<unk> on streets of tiny village
the beluga can carry the wings of an a three hundred and forty airliner or a fuselage section for airbus newest wide body aircraft the a three hundred and fifty
but it's not large enough to transport many a three hundred and eighty super jumbo parts
those need to travel by boat barge and road
with the a three hundred now out of service the new <unk> will be based on the airbus a three hundred and thirty and be bigger than the existing fleet
while the current planes can only carry one wing for the new a three hundred and fifty at a time the new jet will be able to take on board both on the same flight
and for plane <unk> who love the unique shape of the existing beluga that will remain much the same
it will be the same look says gosselin because we will operate both <unk> in parallel for a number of years and it will also be compatible with existing loading means
the first of the new fleet will enter service in two thousand and twenty
however what i experienced showed me the better side of what filipinos and the philippines can be
before the mass the streets lining the main boulevard where the pope's <unk> would pass en route to <unk> park were already lined thick with people who had arrived by dawn hoping to catch a glimpse of the pontiff
the pope is a human saint when we see him our problems go away said thirty five year old <unk> <unk>
rick <unk> fifty four who had followed the pope to every event in manila said that even if he did not manage to see him personally he feels he'd feel blessed just to be near him
for me he is the super pope because he is very human and helpful
i want to follow his example
and he is the ultimate guide to the path to heaven <unk> explained
ex street kid <unk> as she asks pope why god lets children suffer
when the <unk> finally drove by the air was filled with cheers <unk> screams and applause
fifteen year old <unk> <unk> told me i felt happy even if just for a moment
i saw him smiling waving his hands at us
i know he probably won't remember but i will remember him
for a hot and humid country used to heavy tropical rain standing outside in the elements for hours didn't seem to be a problem
<unk> wet by lunchtime everyone was still smiling and happy
joey <unk> fifty five who had stood in the rain for five hours explained i feel like it's shining it's really warm
i don't feel the rain
the weather also brought out the filipinos <unk> creativity and <unk>
having listened to the advisory against bringing <unk> those who did not have <unk> wore every form of plastic <unk>
people protected their heads with towels helmets and even shower caps and bubble wrap and trash bags were fashioned into <unk> hats shirts and <unk>
thousands of faithful having found the main venue packed to capacity wandered around the carnival like atmosphere passing <unk> and snack vendors and people waving <unk> wood or <unk> religious figures in search of somewhere to stand and pray
at times the massive flow of people pushed me into a crowd moving in two directions at once with enough room to move only inches forward at a time
but despite this people remained kind and helpful
when i found it impossible to shoot a colleague on video because throngs of people were passing by nonstop one lady offered to hold my umbrella over the camera and another volunteered to direct people around us as we filmed
no matter where you looked on nearby roxas boulevard usually a traffic filled main artery the spirit in the air was ordered and peaceful
hundreds of thousands of people lined up calmly behind police barricades before during and after the mass showing a patience and humility that made me proud
they were here united in purpose because they believed and faith knows no clock
from the altar surrounded by screens the pope told the massive congregation that god created the world as a beautiful garden and asked us to care for it
though he said through sin man has also destroyed the unity and beauty of our human family creating social structures which <unk> poverty ignorance and corruption
the people around me said they hoped the pope's visit would start to heal what one lady described as the illness of the country
lucy <unk> a high school teacher said our government officials should have the integrity and the wisdom to govern our country well without corruption without taking advantage of small people the simple people
<unk> joey <unk> fifty five proudly carrying a carved <unk> nino icon in his arm offered another prayer
i hope he can help with poverty those who are having a hard time
they need jobs better living conditions and a better future for our children
as the majestic sound of the church singing echoed through the streets i looked at the silent faces of those bowing their heads in <unk>
i could not but feel a sense of unity in the moment
<unk> <unk> a sixty five year old retired army officer who traveled thirteen hours by bus to see the pope said
today i feel there is peace and <unk> among filipino people or any other race present here at this moment
i feel so happy
it should be carried on
he was one of the most high profile north korean defectors winning several human rights awards and inspiring a documentary as his memoir was translated into twenty seven languages
now the publisher of the book and its author say shin who claims to have been born in and escaped from a north korean prison camp has revealed that parts of the story he told weren't true
shin may have spent most of his life in north korea at a different prison camp rather than the total control zone that formed the title of his biography
shin's accounts of his time in the <unk> have been widely reported in interviews with media including cnn
he also wrote an opinion piece describing his experiences for cnn digital
<unk> harden author of the book escape from camp fourteen said in a statement on his website over the weekend that shin had changed key parts of his story
on friday jan. sixteen i learned that shin dong <unk> the north korean prison camp survivor who is the subject of escape from camp fourteen had told friends an account of his life that differed substantially from my book harden said
i contacted shin pressing him to detail the changes and explain why he had misled me
harden declined to provide additional details to cnn but published a lengthy explanation on his website
a washington post story based on information harden said he had provided to the newspaper said the most horrific details of shin's story still stand but some of the times and places of the events in his accounts were wrong
from a human rights perspective he was still brutally tortured but he moved things around harden told the post where he worked as a reporter for twenty eight years
shin did not immediately respond to a request from cnn for comment
in a post on his facebook page he doesn't go into details about the purported <unk> but he includes a link to the <unk> story and <unk> to his supporters
this particular past of mine that i so badly wanted to cover up can no longer be hidden nor do i want it to be he says
to those who have supported me trusted me and believed in me all this time i am so very grateful and at the same time so very sorry to each and every single one of you
shin significantly revised details of his early life said harden in a statement
the inaccuracies include the following
in the book in his united nations testimony and in interviews with media including cnn shin has detailed torture and abuse he claimed occurred in a notorious prison known as camp fourteen
shin told harden on friday that he'd actually been transferred with his mother and brother to a less restrictive prison camp camp eighteen when he was six years old
it was there not at camp fourteen where shin now says he witnessed authorities execute his mother and brother
shin had previously said that he had lived his entire life in camp fourteen before escaping in two thousand and five
he now says he escaped from camp eighteen twice before in one thousand nine hundred and ninety nine and two thousand and one wrote harden in his statement
during his second escape attempt from camp eighteen he was caught in china and <unk> to north korea
first he was sent to camp eighteen and later transferred to camp fourteen for torture and punishment wrote harden
shin now says he was twenty years old when he was tortured as a punishment for escaping wrote harden
his original account indicated that he was tortured when he was thirteen for plotting to escape
shin had been saying that he was tortured when he was a teenager since his arrival to south korea in two thousand and six
shin had described in the book that his finger was chopped off by an angry guard after he dropped a <unk> machine in camp fourteen
now shin told harden that his finger was <unk> as a guard pulled out his <unk> as punishment for escaping
when i agreed to share my experience for the book i found it was too painful to think about some of the things that happened shin told harden
so i made a compromise in my mind
i altered some details that i thought wouldn't matter
i didn't want to tell exactly what happened in order not to <unk> these painful moments all over again
shin told harden that he thought that dates places and circumstances were not all that significant according to the <unk> statement
accounts from north korean defectors are often difficult to confirm with lack of documents and the regime's general secrecy
harden stated that he was working with the publisher to amend the book
it's unclear what action the <unk> publisher will take in response to the <unk> in shin's story
viking the publisher of escape from camp fourteen by <unk> harden has been <unk> that there were some inaccuracies in the story shin dong <unk> the subject of the book told the author penguin books spokeswoman louise <unk> said in a written statement sunday
we are working with the author on an accurate understanding of the facts
north korea has repeatedly denied shin's claims and described testimony before a united nations commission by him and others as <unk> put forward by human scum
in a video posted last year on a website that carries pro pyongyang propaganda shin's father denied that his son was ever in a prison camp
shin said in response that his father had been taken hostage and was being used in a campaign to <unk> him
human rights activists argue that changes in shin's account do not ultimately affect his testimony saying they still believe he was tortured and that his story highlights the horror of prison camps
the new york times reported sunday that shin said he had held back about revealing inaccuracies in his story out of concerns that it could hurt his advocacy work
i <unk> because friends feared the damage my coming out might do to the movement for north korean human rights he said according to the times
in his facebook post shin said he was not sure if he would be able to continue his efforts to end political prison camps in north korea
but instead of me you can all still fight he said
i still have faith in you
the film <unk> with paul newman in one thousand nine hundred and sixty three or bad day at black rock with spencer tracy
and junior <unk> with steve <unk> as a sort of rodeo rider said richmond
it seemed like another world from sort of <unk> england
when he turned seventeen richmond headed to the united states where he spent three months <unk> his way through the western states
i just wanted to see things like i'd seen in films he said
richmond captures the <unk> and expanse of places like central wyoming and montana in his latest photography project last best hiding place which releases in book format in june in the united kingdom and in the fall in the united states
but don't expect any <unk> <unk> scenes in his photography
i preferred the idea of actually slowly looking at the places away from perhaps western art he explained
looking at the the sort of everyday side of things which i find more interesting
richmond began the project seven years ago as the financial crisis began to unfold across the united states
he said he was surprised by the scale of development on halt in the towns outside salt lake city
he named his photography series last best hiding place after a phrase he came across during his travels referring to those living slightly under the radar in remote parts of the american west
some of the parts in
central wyoming and central montana they are as remote as i've ever been richmond said
and when you're traveling fifty miles between almost just a gas station and that's it it sort of changes one's viewpoint of scale and distance
richmond spent the early part of his career as a fashion photographer and taking portraits of actors including ben <unk> ian <unk> and <unk> thompson but his heart wasn't in it
i wasn't really thrilled by the idea of being a fashion photographer richmond said
after the death of my first wife it just sort of taught me to do what you want to do and i go ok i want to concentrate on this sort of work
his images include people and places in faraway towns like miles city montana
<unk> south dakota
and <unk> utah
often richmond would determine where he'd go next by pulling out a map and picking a town that had an interesting name
sometimes it worked sometimes it didn't
i remember looking in utah one time and i came across this town i just thought well it sounds really interesting and it's in the hills and it's called <unk> richmond explained
the story of the town itself is quite typical of a lot of those towns
it was nothing no food it grew huge and then slowly died off
the thing that really fascinated me was the fact that this town was really hanging on
everything just seemed to click in that town
richmond spent one summer traveling with a group of rodeo cowboys captured in one image simply doing their laundry
he said the biggest culture shock of his entire trip happened during the rodeo events
i was surprised by
the sense that at <unk> you have the whole idea of prayers
it's such an un english thing
at any sort of sports event you wouldn't have a quiet moment and say the <unk> prayer and god bless the troops
but out there it seemed absolutely standard
out of the thousands of images that he took richmond carefully selected ones he felt embody the real face of the american west
but he insists that his audience needs to create their own <unk> about what they are witnessing in his photos
the place has to resonate with me
there has to have some sort of <unk> or poetry about the image so people can see into it he said
there's no story here so the pictures don't have to fit in
these pictures can float around a bit more they don't have to fit with a strict text narrative
relations across the florida straits turned so bad that the two countries pushed the entire world to the brink of nuclear war
exploding cigars to blow up cuba's rebel leader fidel castro or toxic <unk> to make his trademark beard fall out were just two of hundreds of shadowy cia plots to thwart the communist revolution
but the cold war between the u.s. and cuba will begin to seriously thaw this week after more than half a century
president barack obama is sending the highest level u.s. delegation in decades to the island this week in a controversial bid to normalize ties between the two former arch foes
spearheading the u.s. diplomatic mission <unk> jacobson assistant secretary of state for western hemisphere affairs she deals with latin america and cuba
jacobson is scheduled to touch down in havana this wednesday
by the time she arrives her deputy alex lee will already be hard at work meeting cuban officials at the state run conventions palace
lee and his team are charged with discussing bilateral migration issues
to make business easier u.s. diplomatic sources tell cnn the u.s and cuban teams are separating the orders of business
on wednesday lee will discuss with cuban officials including the number and types of visas the u.s. offers to cubans wishing to visit or go live in the united states
one of the reasons that is so important is that over the decades thousands of cubans have left the island either legally or <unk> sometimes in perilous homemade boats or rafts
on thursday <unk> team will meet a cuban delegation led by her counterpart <unk> <unk> the director of the north american division of cuba's foreign relations ministry
their role is to explore ways to launch normal diplomatic and commercial relations
there is clearly a lot of work to be done and this week's negotiations could chart the path forward for a larger agreement on normalizing relations
in a conference call with reporters on monday a senior state department official expressed measured optimism about the talks but noted that much would depend on the willingness of the cuban government to engage the u.s. on a broad range of issues
certainly in this conversation we're able to get on the table all of the things that we are interested in and all of the things the cuban government is interested in so that we know the parameters within which we're working the official said adding that the u.s. delegation does not expect to close every issue of contention in these talks alone
asked whether there might soon be an opportunity for the secretary of state to meet with his cuban counterparts the official was hardly dismissive
we would see the secretary's visit down to cuba as something that would take place in the future the official said adding that such a trip would depend largely on how these and other upcoming diplomatic talks play out
president dwight eisenhower broke off relations with cuba and shut down the embassy in january one thousand nine hundred and sixty one
two years earlier leftist rebels led by fidel castro and <unk> <unk> among others swept to power <unk> gen. <unk> batista the dictator backed by the u.s. government and by the u.s. mafia which ran lucrative prostitution and gambling rackets on the island
cuba progressively allied itself with the soviet union
in april one thousand nine hundred and sixty one kennedy launched the botched bay of pigs invasion
and in one thousand nine hundred and sixty two as the soviet union deployed nuclear missiles to cuba and pointed them at the u.s. the world <unk> toward atomic <unk> in what became known as the cuban missile crisis
down the years the cuban government backed leftist and communist regimes and uprisings in latin america and africa
that earned the island a spot on a u.s. blacklist known as the state sponsors of terrorism a dubious classification it still shares with syria sudan and iran
in later years cuban u.s. relations were marked by successive crises sparked by refugees trying to get out of cuba and cross the florida straits in <unk> craft
the meetings scheduled between the u.s. and cuban delegations this week in havana are likely to achieve baby steps on a much longer road to normalization u.s. diplomats have told cnn
one of the practical issues on the table will be the measures needed to convert the u.s
interests section one of the largest diplomatic missions in terms of staff on the island with more than fifty u.s. citizens including ten marines who act as guards into a full embassy
cuba will be looking to do likewise with its mission in washington
the two sides are expected to discuss matters such as staffing numbers and the restriction currently placed on u.s. diplomats that forbids them traveling more than twenty five miles from the interests section
secretary of state john kerry has already begun his review about whether to remove cuba from the state sponsors of terrorism list u.s. diplomatic sources told cnn
a senior state department official told reporters the department expects to complete that review quickly possibly well ahead of the six month deadline set by the president
these discussions are the first since obama last month announced two nations would move towards normalization of relations after decades of a u.s. embargo against the communist nation
as part of that move the u.s. relaxed some of the travel restrictions meaning more americans can visit the island nation
that easing came into effect this weekend
previously u.s. citizens had to seek a license from the treasury department to go there so now they don't so long as the travel meets one of a dozen criteria
while travel restrictions are only now being loosened already people are visiting cuba from the u.s. in greater numbers
last year one hundred thousand u.s. citizens visited cuba on people to people cultural travel and some four hundred thousand cubans living in the u.s. made trips back to the island
there was also some easing of commercial rules americans can use credit cards while there and they can bring back four hundred dollar worth of cuban goods and one hundred dollar of tobacco or alcohol products
as part of the talks that led to the normalization announcement last month cuba agreed to release fifty three political prisoners but that became controversial as u.s. officials refused to identify them or to say when they would be freed
last week the state department announced cuba had in fact freed all of those prisoners
in addition to talks about opening embassies and re establishing diplomatic ties the two governments are also expected to talk about human rights and further commerce
on migration matters havana is especially upset over the u.s. law the so called wet foot dry foot law which allows cubans citizenship for those who reach american soil
cuban officials argue the law encourages cubans to take the dangerous often fatal journey across the straits of florida
it has been widely rumored that that legislation seen as giving <unk> migration status to cubans could be revoked
but u.s. diplomatic sources in havana told cnn the issue was not being put on the table by us
several american airlines have expressed interest in starting flights to havana as soon as the two governments hammer out an agreement authorizing them
and according to the office of new york gov
andrew cuomo the governor plans on leading a trade mission to cuba in the coming term
this weekend a separate u.s. delegation led by democratic sen. patrick leahy and including five other congressmen is in cuba
this visit has no direct relationship to <unk> delegation
ukraine's president and prime minister were among those who attended the rally that had as its slogan i am volnovakha in memory of the thirteen passengers who died near the city of volnovakha after their bus was hit by artillery shelling on january thirteen
we will remember every ukrainian hero who gave for the sake of independence sovereignty and territorial integrity of ukraine said ukrainian president petro poroshenko
we will not give up a single meter of our land
meanwhile fighting in the east continued
government forces and pro russia rebels have been battling for control of eastern donetsk and luhansk regions since april after russia annexed ukraine's southeastern crimea region the previous month
the ukrainian army was able to regain full control of the donetsk airport military spokesman col. <unk> <unk> said sunday
over the last twenty four hours four ukrainian soldiers were killed and thirty two were wounded the spokesman said
a seven year old boy and a sixteen year old were killed when a missile struck a house in the town of <unk> in donetsk said <unk> regional police chief vyacheslav abroskin on his facebook page
a young girl was seriously injured
a ceasefire deal was reached on september five in minsk belarus following talks between representatives of ukraine russia and rebel leaders
a subsequent agreement on september nineteen set out more measures but there has been little sign of progress as all sides blame each other for the bloodshed
the united nations issued a statement sunday calling on all parties to exercise restraint
the secretary general is alarmed by the severe escalation of fighting for control of donetsk airport in eastern ukraine which has already caused numerous casualties and threatened to completely unravel a hard won september two thousand and fourteen cease fire it read
the statement continued
the secretary general stresses that further <unk> of a situation that has led to heavy loss of life and civilian suffering must be avoided at all costs
the united nations stands ready to support all efforts toward de escalation and the <unk> of a genuine peace process to restore ukraine's stability and territorial integrity
that means average land and sea temperatures worldwide have never been hotter in modern times according to the national oceanic and atmospheric administration and the national <unk> and space administration
this isn't about whether we believe in science
it's about whether we believe the thermometer
in fact the sixteen hottest years on record have all occurred since one thousand nine hundred and ninety seven the new data confirm contributing to widening deserts rising seas withering drought ravaging storms blistering heat and other climate change impacts reaching from the tiniest african village to our own <unk>
here in the united states arizona nevada alaska and california all wrapped up their hottest years on record
california remains mired in the grip of a three year drought its worst in centuries
the northeast is still rebuilding from hurricane sandy
and that was just one of the climate related disasters that cost this country an estimated one hundred and thirty nine billion dollar in damages in two thousand and twelve alone
above and beyond the economic costs climate change has created a widening humanitarian crisis noted by spiritual leaders around the world
for example pope francis is expected to publish an <unk> on the state of the world's environment singling out climate change as an urgent challenge to global stewardship
it's reported that he'll call on people of all faiths to embrace our obligation to protect future generations from this grave and gathering scourge
president obama has embarked on the single greatest u.s. effort yet to combat this growing menace by reducing the dangerous carbon pollution that's driving climate chaos
he has directed the environmental protection agency to put in place the first limits on carbon pollution from the power plants that account for about forty percents of the u.s. carbon footprint
under the president's clean power plan we'll cut carbon emissions from our power plants twenty six percents by two thousand and twenty and thirty percents by two thousand and thirty
we can do better than that and we should
the president's plan puts us on the right track
since last summer epa officials have been hard at work coordinating with their state counterparts public service commissions power companies and other vested stakeholders to come up with tailor made plans to hit the targets in the most cost effective way
some power companies are already well on their way investing in efficiency so we can do more with less waste getting more power from the wind and sun cleaning up dirty power plants or some combination of the three
even as we as a nation begin to make progress though some coal gas and oil companies and their allies on capitol hill want to turn us back around
republican leaders in the congress have pledged to lead legislative efforts meant to keep the epa from cutting carbon pollution
the republican leaders aren't offering answers of their own mind you
they just want to block any action that could help us address the problem of climate change
it's part of the big <unk> agenda they've vowed to press putting fossil fuel profits first and putting the rest of us at risk
we have a responsibility in this country to stand up and speak out for what matters most
that's the essence of american democracy
it's part of what makes us exceptional
it's part of what makes us great
we just finished worldwide the hottest year on record
those are facts no amount of climate change denial can alter
we have a choice in this country
we can continue to feed climate disaster by anchoring our future in the fossil fuels of the past or we can protect future generations from the ravages of climate change by investing in the clean energy solutions of tomorrow

the image ignited a wide ranging debate in the comments of the picture about the ongoing conflict between israel and much of the arab world
officially israel and lebanon are still at war even though there have been no large scale hostilities on the border since two thousand and six
travel between them by citizens of the two countries is prohibited
the miss universe organization defended the picture saying it was unfortunate that the picture has been perceived in a negative light
at an event with one of our charitable partners miss universe lebanon and miss universe israel <unk> ended up in an impromptu photo together which was then posted on instagram the organization said in a statement to cnn
it is unfortunate to know a photo of four smiling women from different parts of the world working together at an event could be <unk> as anything other than what it is a celebration of universal friendship which the miss universe pageant is all about
greige addressed the controversy on saturday on social media sharing what she called the truth behind the photo
she also posted the same photo on her instagram account with miss israel <unk> out
from the start of pageant preparations greige said she was very cautious to avoid being in any photo or communication with miss israel
as she explains it she was posing for a photo with miss japan and miss slovenia when suddenly miss israel jumped in took a selfie and put it on her social media she said
matalon weighed in sunday after a website posted an article with the headline miss lebanon in trouble
she took a <unk> of the article and <unk> it it doesn't surprise me but it still makes me sad and posted it on her social media accounts
too bad you can not put the hostility out of the game only for three weeks of an experience of a lifetime that we can meet girls from around the world and also from the neighboring country
comments on her original photo echoed the sentiment
as a lebanese i really don't see anything wrong with this picture
it's time we promote peace over violence as the latter has gotten us no where
and if you really wan na discuss politics it surely shouldn't be under the picture of four beautiful ladies who have nothing to do with your b <unk> good luck ladies
it's not the first time beauty pageants have been caught up in political controversy
according to multiple news reports former miss lebanon christina <unk> pulled out of miss universe two thousand and two because she did not want to share the stage with miss israel amid tensions in the middle east
the miss universe pageant has always been a celebration of different cultures welcoming women from all around the globe
it provides an opportunity for the participants to see just how much they have in common the organization said
with eighty eight women from around the world coming together for the miss universe pageant new friendships are forged and we hope that these relationships can make inroads for change in the future
it comes courtesy of the award winning cocktail waitress at <unk>
a private restaurant run by forty one year old cuban entrepreneur alain rodriguez
the recipe for success is maintaining the real taste of cuba whether that's in the food and drink or our taste for life he told me
businesses like <unk> are among the most visible examples of economic reforms that are fueling small private enterprise already launched by president raul castro
rodriguez a former <unk> at havana's famed el nacional hotel says he set up his own business just over two years ago in a house owned by his cousin and financed with his own savings and some investment from relatives in the united states
now small businesses like his could get substantial new cash injections thanks to measures announced by president barack obama which came into effect friday
among the changes it will be easier for americans and their spending money to come to cuba
cuban authorities and tourism industry experts estimate that could open the door to one million u.s. visitors a year added to the expected three million international tourists from other parts of the world
equally significant the obama administration has approved a four fold increase in remittances from cuban americans to their families in cuba and no upper limit on remittances destined to fund small business
unveiling the changes to u.s. trade and travel policy on december seventeen obama said
we're calling on cuba to unleash the potential of eleven million cubans by ending unnecessary resistance to their political social and economic activities
<unk> the decision drew fire from some u.s. republicans who thought the easing of restrictions would put more money into the hands of the cuban government the united states longstanding cold war foe
but perhaps obama's decision over time could prove to be a <unk> to generating change on the island
u.s. economist milton friedman a former adviser to president ronald reagan once said
economic freedom is an indispensable means to the achievement of political freedom
now with obama's changes some ordinary cubans could gain higher incomes because they work in the growing tourist sector could set up private businesses or could receive higher value remittances from families in the united states
others may be left behind unable to make ends meet on meager state sector wages currently running around twenty dollar a month
as economic divisions are exacerbated so is the chance of growing political divisions that could ultimately chip away at cuba's socialist system
if salaries start to rise and more remittances come in then great
in cuba we don't pay much attention to who is a first second or third class citizen
but if that starts to happen we'll have to see how we deal with it he said
rodriguez is already considering the possibility of new outlets and has patented his <unk>
trade name with a view to possible franchise options
but he is convinced liberalization must be gradual and <unk>
he does not favor a free for all
he says all his twenty staff are affiliated to the cuban labor federation <unk> and march in the may day parade to havana's revolution square
rodriguez is a firm believer that cuban government reforms coupled with a bigger influx of u.s. dollars will not undermine cuban socialism
across havana at a very different type of private business nail salon owner <unk> <unk> has a very different viewpoint
at twenty nine she has never worked for the state
she charges around five dollar as she works quickly but precisely <unk> then painting <unk> like <unk> nails
she seems to have a well established clientele who drop by a side room in her ground floor apartment in old havana
<unk> expresses very little patience for cuba's socialist system and perhaps surprisingly is not afraid to speak her mind
i am one of the capitalist generation
i've never worked for the state and i believe that the capitalist generation is better than the other she said
until fairly recently such talk would have run her the risk of being branded a counter revolutionary by her neighbors
<unk> is <unk> when she suggests her generation has little time for talk of the cuban revolution
all that business of fidel and the revolution is a very pretty story but it's got nothing to do with now she said
now its different
young people want to go to good places a disco an all expenses paid hotel and with a state salary you just can't do that
above her <unk> <unk> has <unk> a sign into the fluorescent light fitting
no money
no nail do
a warning that cuba's once cherished dream of <unk> an <unk> society may be <unk>
the attacks happened in the villages of <unk> and <unk> in the mayo <unk> division of the far north region of cameroon on sunday morning <unk> <unk> a journalist for the state broadcaster told cnn
three of those kidnapped were found dead <unk> said
the cameroonian government did not immediately comment
meanwhile thousands of chadian troops arrived in cameroon to join that country's soldiers in the fight against boko haram
the governor of cameroon's far north region <unk> bakary told cnn that the first contingent of chadian troops arrived in a convoy of more than four hundred vehicles and a second wave of soldiers were expected to arrive soon
the chadian soldiers are coming in with dozens of tanks armored vehicles and other military equipment cameroon defense ministry spokesman col. didier badjeck said
the chadian parliament unanimously voted friday to send troops to cameroon and nigeria to join in the fight against boko haram
the move comes after cameroon's president paul biya made a strong call for international cooperation in the fight against boko haram
biya told diplomats recently that boko haram was a global threat that calls for a global response
such should be the response of the international community including the african union and our regional organizations he said
chadian officials concluded that boko haram also poses a danger to chad
chadian president idriss deby said attacks on cameroon by the terrorist group could destroy <unk> economy
we can't remain <unk> to what is happening to our neighbors deby said
cameroon is the entry and exit point for chad economically
much of what is imported to chad comes through the cameroonian <unk> of <unk> and <unk> crude oil is transported through a pipeline that runs from southern chad to a floating facility eleven kilometers off the cameroon coast
the presence of chadian troops on the front could be key to reversing the gains so far made by the terrorist group
trained in desert combat chadian forces played a critical role in fighting jihadists in northern mali where they became major allies to french troops in the fight against terrorists there
in fact they were instrumental in the killing of some high profile jihadists
the involvement of chadian troops marks a major shift in cameroon chad anti terrorism cooperation
in the past year it focused mostly on securing individual borders
while chad is the first country to put boots on the ground in cameroon the international community and regional bodies are also expressing concern
on friday the russian ambassador to cameroon <unk> <unk> said his country will supply cameroon with modern and sophisticated military weapons
he said the equipment will include heavy artillery armored cars and missiles
michael stephen <unk> u.s. ambassador to cameroon also said his country would help train cameroon soldiers and offer equipment for the fight
boko haram has been staging cross border raids on cameroon the latest being the attempt by the insurgents to take over a cameroon military base in <unk>
cameroonian troops killed one hundred and forty three of them and lost one soldier
on january three boko haram fighters briefly took over control of a military base in <unk> forcing cameroonian soldiers to retreat and then for the first time use airstrikes against the insurgents
attacks on military installations mark a big shift in boko haram operations in cameroon
<unk> would cross the border and either attack to steal food or kidnap nationals and expatriates in exchange for ransoms
cameroon has already deployed about seven thousand troops across the far north where boko haram has scaled up attacks over the past six months
the new england patriots are going to the super bowl for the eighth time after defeating the visiting indianapolis colts forty five seven in the afc championship game on sunday
the patriots will play the seattle seahawks in super bowl xlix on february one
the defending nfl champion seattle seahawks downed the green bay packers twenty eight twenty two in overtime in sunday's nfc championship game
the seahawks who beat the broncos in last year's nfl title game will face either the indianapolis colts or the new england patriots in super bowl xlix on february one
previous story posted at eleven thirty one a.m
et
the end is near
in two weeks the super bowl will be upon us
after this <unk> of american sports spectacles the salad days of basketball and baseball will follow along with a smattering of other sports but in the good <unk> us of a we know who is king
no not lebron james silly
football is king
these last two weeks of pro football are what every fan has been waiting for even as a sinking feeling grows in the pit of each of their <unk> with the realization that after twelve more quarters of football it's over till september
<unk> wives and girlfriends and even husbands and <unk> will rejoice as the football gods return their beloved not to mention her or his attention span and weekend productivity will reach peaks unseen since the summer
soon your loved one can finally join you on your <unk> trip for a second opinion on that <unk>
but before you get too excited you must get through these last fourteen days and what better way to build some goodwill ahead of next month's <unk> trip than to show you care what happens
pretending you care about the super bowl is easy
nfl fans are sure everyone cares about the super bowl even if you're secretly hoping the men in tight pants quit throwing the brown ball around so you can see more ten million dollar <unk> commercials
conference championships are another story
in fact you may be asking what's a conference championship
fear not you <unk> soul you
cnn has you covered with five things that will make you look as though you have more than the slightest idea what is happening sunday
in the national football conference the seattle seahawks and the green bay packers will face off in seattle at three five p.m
et while the new england patriots and indianapolis colts will kick off the american football conference championship in <unk> massachusetts at six forty p.m
et
what's a <unk>
don't ask that aloud
no one knows
but they're the defending champions after <unk> the denver broncos in last year's super bowl
want to start a fun conversation over the dip bowl
ask how it is that denver quarterback <unk> manning is always mentioned among the greatest yet with one exception always loses at some point in the playoffs
after the heated debate dies down you can say matter of <unk> well at least he has a career in <unk> pizza and insurance to fall back on
then toss some chips in your mouth and walk off
it appears las vegas is not expecting much of a contest in either game
both games are predicted to be decided by a touchdown which is a rather large spread for a conference championship
in the regular season the seahawks beat the packers by twenty points in week one while the patriots beat the colts by twenty two in week eleven but don't pay that too much attention
weeks can be like dog years in the nfl
seattle is a seven or eight point favorite over green bay which isn't that surprising given seattle has been on a tear of late green <unk> quarterback is <unk> and <unk> field is one of the more terrible venues to play in
they have this thing called the twelve th man which is actually tens of thousands of <unk> loud fans
they have their own flag and they don't care that navy blue and neon green clash
new england is also expected to win by seven to hear vegas tell it
the patriots have lost only two games since september and one of those losses to the buffalo bills on december twenty eight may have been a product of the pats not taking the game too seriously since they had already locked up their division
they also have tom terrific who tends to shine in big games though it should be noted that the patriots have lost the last two afc championships and their last two super bowls
green bay quarterback aaron rodgers has been getting it done since week four after telling uneasy packers fans to relax after the team got off to a one two start
the packers have lost only two games since then
rodgers is surrounded by talent as his offensive line running back eddie <unk> and wide receiver <unk> nelson have been getting it done all season
the green bay defense is led by clay <unk> who will be looking to disrupt <unk> rushing and passing games
look for seattle running back and <unk> <unk> <unk> lynch and quarterback russell wilson another insurance salesman to make some big plays but in seattle defense <unk>
you might remember <unk> richard sherman from his <unk> <unk> after last year's nfc championship but also look for <unk> earl thomas and <unk> chancellor to be <unk> the <unk>
especially keep an eye on chancellor
it's possible that he <unk> beaten the carolina <unk> all by himself last week
that's only a slight exaggeration
in the afc championship you'll want to watch indianapolis quarterback andrew luck
he was the first round draft pick in two thousand and twelve effectively resulting in a colts legend manning leaving for denver and he's been showing he is worth the hype passing for almost thirteen thousand yards in his first three seasons
with little in the way of a running game you'll see him using his tight ends a lot while looking for wide receiver <unk>
hilton to make big plays something the patriots have promised to prevent
the patriots have a solid defense <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> jamie collins and <unk> <unk> will look to make life <unk> for luck but they're better known for a rounded team effort on offense
yes brady will be looking for the six foot six rob <unk> to break free in <unk> but expect him to spread the ball around plenty especially to running back <unk> gray who showed his upside in a four touchdown effort earlier this season
against the colts
in seattle and the boston area
oh most certainly
the national weather service on sunday morning issued a high wind warning for northwest washington
winds are expected to reach speeds of up to forty mph with gusts up to sixty mph but forecasters predict they will die down before kickoff
there's also about an eighty percents chance of rain
with the wet and the wind the kicking and passing games could be tricky for both teams but the seahawks and packers have outstanding running backs in lynch and <unk> so that may make life easier for them
on the plus side it will be in the high forty s or low fifty s throughout the game so they won't be battling bitter cold
it will be a little colder in <unk> for the afc championship but not much somewhere in the mid forty s. the boston area also has a good chance of rain and winds will be moving at around fifteen mph
though brady and luck are both skilled ball handlers and both <unk> their trade in chilly <unk> there's always the possibility that the wind and rain will make for a <unk> game especially when you consider neither team has the safety net of an awesome running back
maybe you've heard the phase aaron rodgers leg in recent days
or perhaps ad <unk>
yes it would be hard for even the most <unk> of fans to have missed the news that rodgers <unk> is torn
how badly is unclear but the seahawks thomas has said he isn't buying the line coming out of the packers camp
what's clear is that rodgers was far from mobile in last week's game against the dallas cowboys
despite rodgers <unk> around in the pocket the cowboys failed to put pressure on him especially in the fourth quarter as the one legged wonder completed twenty four of thirty five passes for three hundred and sixteen yards and tossed three <unk>
don't expect <unk> defensive players to be so <unk>
expect them to bring the house and often against rodgers and try to knock him down on every play
and don't expect the legion of boom to go any easier on his receivers or on <unk> who has been complaining of knee soreness ahead of sunday's matchup
in <unk> you'll have a more traditional story line in the old guard versus the new
brady of course is the poster boy for winners and not because of the <unk> boots contract and being married to <unk> <unk>
since coming to the nfl in two thousand and one he's played in five super bowls and won three of them
this will be his ninth afc championship game
but remember he's lost his last two conference championships and his last two super bowls so don't be surprised when commentators wonder aloud if luck twenty five who has taken the colts to the playoffs in each of his three seasons is ready to take the crown from the thirty seven year old <unk> head
want a fun drinking game
take a <unk> from your beer every time someone says heir apparent during the <unk> show
a first half penalty from <unk> <unk> and a second half <unk> <unk> header secured all three points for the north london club <unk> their champions league ambitions whilst leaving second place manchester city five points <unk> of chelsea
arsenal have had a terrible record against top four opposition away from home in recent years and little was expected of a team ravaged by defensive injuries
last season manchester city won the <unk> fixture six three
instead arsenal put in a <unk> disciplined performance against a manchester city team without their <unk> midfielder <unk> toure who is now at the african cup of nations and struggling to score goals
although striker sergio <unk> started he looked rusty and rarely threatened colombia world cup goalkeeper david <unk> in the arsenal goal
it took a soft penalty to open the scoring when manchester city's captain vincent <unk> was judged to have <unk> <unk> <unk> as he <unk> into the box
<unk> <unk> by far the best player on the pitch dispatched the penalty despite manchester city goalkeeper joe hart guessing the right way
the penalty changed the game manchester city coach manuel <unk> told sky sports after the game hinting that he believed <unk> <unk> the referee
it was not a penalty he added
manchester city didn't look like <unk> and it wasn't a surprise when <unk> <unk> doubled the lead with a header early in the second half converting from a <unk> free kick
we played high up in their half and it worked because we knew we wanted to make the space tight and we did it well arsenal coach arsene wenger said after the game
people are very quick to judge and you forget we have many defenders out
it was down to discipline
we have a very important fight in front of us
the victory lifted arsenal into fifth place one point behind manchester united
manchester city however are now five points behind leader's chelsea

president obama says he's on the offensive and he has certainly unveiled an ambitious list of proposals in the weeks leading up to the state of the union speech tuesday night

chris christie might be telling republicans to relax about the race for the white house but sen. lindsey graham wants the gop to get serious about his candidacy
cnn's peter hamby reports that graham had a meeting with some of his top donors about a week ago in south carolina and told them
in the first quarter of this year i'm going to raise half a million dollars go to early states and see if there's a space for me in this field
while graham's candidacy might end up being more of an issue driven campaign rather than a serious bid for the nation's top office his run might cause some trouble for other candidates in an important early contest
if he does run remember south carolina is an early primary state and that would put a lot of his top donors and operatives in a <unk> because usually they have their choice of candidates to support said hamby
but if their hometown guy runs for president they're going to have a choice to make
it has been more than a month now since hillary clinton held a public event but that doesn't mean she is taking a break from politics
to the contrary
as has been widely reported the former secretary of state is building a two thousand and sixteen campaign team that looks very different from her two thousand and eight high command
her husband's former chief of staff john podesta is leaving the obama white house to lead team hillary
and two veterans of the two thousand and eight and two thousand and twelve obama campaigns will serve as clinton's top strategist and chief media adviser
the biggest question is whether clinton has been using this down time to hone her campaign rationale to answer liberal critics who say she is too cozy with wall street or republican critics who label her more about the past than the future
but while awaiting her return to the public stage on wednesday even senior republicans and those democrats pushing to draft elizabeth warren concede her two thousand and sixteen staff recruits are top notch

in foggy conditions and on soft snow in the women's downhill at <unk> <unk> italy vonn recorded a time of one minute thirty nine point six one seconds beating austria's <unk> <unk> by zero point three two seconds
the victory tied vonn with austria's <unk> <unk> <unk> who set the benchmark between one thousand nine hundred and seventy and one thousand nine hundred and eighty
i was a little bit nervous in the start the thirty year old said in an interview with the international ski federation website
i thought i <unk> really well on friday but it was tough conditions and i wasn't able to be on top of the podium
today was kind of the same the snow was soft but at least it was sunny
i just tried to keep my feet underneath me and not to push the <unk> against the snow too much and it worked out
the victory marks an incredible comeback for vonn who had been out with a serious knee injury for eighteen months
in a desperate attempt to get fit for the two thousand and fourteen sochi winter olympics vonn aggravated her knee and needed a second operation
much of the talk since her comeback has concerned the world cup record which has proved something of a distraction
every time i'm in the starting gate i'm trying to win whether it's sixty sixty one sixty two or whatever it is i just try to ski my best she said
so it was more frustrating just talking about this record in the media
but for me mentally it was the same as any other race
now i'm happy we can stop talking about it
although few will actually stop talking about it
vonn now has the chance to hold the record outright with sixty three wins in monday's super g
i've surprised myself how far i come vonn told cnn after her victory
i'm really excited for another race tomorrow
hopefully i can break the record tomorrow
i love what i do
i want to win as many races as possible
i have a lot more to give the sport

as china's president during a time of unprecedented growth and change xi jinping has guided a number of transformational initiatives
but few industries have felt his influence so profoundly as china's exploding domestic tourism sector
from food he snacks on to mundane tourist observations he makes here are eight ways in which xi jinping has had an impact on tourism within mainland china and in some cases beyond
xi <unk> taste <unk> have become so influential that hong kong's apple daily has compared the president to a walking michelin guide for china
want to try the pig blood noodles xi <unk> twenty years ago
a noodle shop in <unk> <unk> where xi ate noodles two decades ago has leveraged the president's popularity into long lines
xi confirmed his love of the dish in two thousand and fourteen and perhaps made the <unk> owners dreams come true when he re visited the place and had another bowl
the owner told a reporter that ever since the news broke out there's been a significant increase in customers
items that had previously been sold out at around eleven p.m. were gone by five p.m
in two thousand and fourteen according to hong kong based newspaper ta <unk> <unk> after the small town of <unk> began promoting its red army rice after xi had eaten a bowl the town reported an eighty percents growth in tourist visits over the previous year
perhaps the best illustration of the xi jinping effect on local cuisine is what's come to be known as the qing feng dumpling incident
in december two thousand and thirteen xi and a handful of government officials visited beijing's qing feng steamed dumpling shop for lunch
xi <unk> paid and picked up his <unk> twenty one lunch by himself a bowl of <unk>
the dish became a <unk> in mainland china turning the humble shop into an overnight sensation
lining up for dumplings now takes at least an hour according to local reports
during the october two thousand and fourteen holiday following xi's visit different branches of qing feng in beijing recorded at least a ninety percents increase in orders mostly from tourists
many overseas business interests called to inquire about franchise rights to the shop
visitors can now order the president set to try the meal xi ate
in an unexpected twist the shop has also become a popular protest site for chinese citizens who <unk> banners and express <unk> often protesting government corruption before heading in for steamed dumplings
during a visit to maldives in two thousand and fourteen xi commented that chinese tourists should behave themselves and act in more civilized fashion overseas
don't throw empty bottles everywhere he instructed
don't damage their coral reef
eat less instant noodles
eat more local seafood
the instant noodle remark was a humorous reference to a widely publicized report in two thousand and thirteen about a maldives resort allegedly removing <unk> from the rooms of chinese tourists fearing they'd only cook cup noodles instead of spending money at the <unk> restaurant
we can't confirm whether chinese tourists are still <unk> instant noodles in their rooms but maldives travel package sales for some companies reportedly doubled after the president's visit
the chinese president can be more effective than a tourism board campaign for attracting chinese tourists
wherever xi travels internationally that country can expect a boost in chinese tourists
in addition to the maldives sri lanka new zealand and south korea are some of the countries that have benefited from the xi bump with a rise in chinese tourists following a visit by the president
package tours to sri lanka during the october one st national day holiday in two thousand and fourteen were fully booked after xi visited the country in september
south korea received twice the amount of chinese tourists during its two thousand and fourteen holiday period compared to the same period in two thousand and thirteen
australia and new zealand promised to simplify visa procedures for chinese tourists after xi's visit
chinese online company <unk> has introduced a special travel page promoting each of the places xi has visited
to keep up with xi's movement many chinese <unk> follow <unk> fan blogger <unk> xi <unk> <unk> <unk> who sometimes releases xi's official <unk> and whereabouts before china's official news agency
anyone who's visited a macau casino knows what it's like to be surrounded by whales finding a betting table with a minimum <unk> of less than one hundred dollar per hand is almost impossible
and those are for ordinary <unk>
vip <unk> in some private rooms reportedly are required to <unk> as much as one hundred and twenty five thousand dollar per hand
for a while those high stakes made macau <unk> heaven for high rolling government officials
that was before xi's high profile anti <unk> campaign aimed in part at government waste and corruption
according to industry experts xi's anti corruption push has stopped a number of vip <unk> from visiting macau a major reason for a twenty seven twenty eight percents plunge in the stock values of the six big casino operators in the city in two thousand and fourteen according to the financial times
in <unk> in eastern china west lake is a well known tourist attraction famed for its romantic <unk> views
according to state media china news service when west lake was opened as a public park in two thousand and two xi who was then secretary of the <unk> <unk> provincial committee began offering suggestions on how to improve the visitor experience
one of these included reducing the number of benches along the lake to provide more privacy for <unk>
xi thought that since the benches were too close to each other it'd be very uncomfortable for the couples liu <unk> director of west lake scenic area management committee told online news platform the paper
the park <unk> giving couples a chance to sneak a few more private moments courtesy of their current president
in october two thousand and fourteen xi called for less weird architecture to be built in the country a reaction to the increasingly extravagant construction projects <unk> up around china
xi cited the cctv headquarters in beijing completed in two thousand and eight which has earned the nickname the big pants for its resemblance to a pair of trousers
beijing authorities responded swiftly by announcing plans to place restrictions on new building designs and materials
does xi's conservative architectural taste mean the end of <unk> and unusual structures in china like these

he decided to continue his walk

thinking a photo of the sign would make for a novel facebook post he snapped an image
after crossing the road he was approached by two other uniformed men in a second <unk> truck and waved into the <unk>
he was driven back to reception which black believes was a police station where his passport camera and cell phone were seized

he was questioned and moved to different rooms waiting for hours at a time but the process was civil he said
no one harmed him in any way
after eight or nine hours at the police station a man came in and asked him to stand
his hands and feet were shackled and a hood was put over his head
he was escorted to an suv where his wrists were chained to the floor
after hours more of interrogation he was driven to the <unk> jail
when the sun rose that morning black was relieved to be greeted with smiles from the other inmates
a few prisoners from the philippines spoke english
their conversation revolved around why black was there and the daily routine at the jail
later in the day police took him back to his hotel and allowed him to retrieve his belongings and check out of the hotel
concerned friends and family called the hotel but couldn't obtain any information on his whereabouts
after black spent about a week in jail a translator for the prosecutor's office felt bad about his plight and <unk> his name black later learned
the translator contacted some of his associates which is how friends and family members learned what had happened to him
he was quickly transferred to al <unk> prison where he met a syrian in his mid thirty s named kousai
all of those who could speak any english were very supportive and helpful in both the prison and the jail black recalled but kousai made the most concerted effort
well educated he had a master's degree in business administration from florida state university and spoke fluent english
black called him the cell <unk> <unk> mother
he was always trying to help and facilitate the needs of the prisoners who came from countries such as oman yemen nigeria and egypt all of them foreign workers
kousai himself had been in prison for six months on an immigration violation
when black first walked in kousai and his roommate a massive man everyone called the foreman offered him an orange drink and crackers
the foreman didn't speak much english black said but seemed to be in charge of the cell block
kousai helped black settle into the facility making sure he had snacks and arranging for black to have his prison clothes <unk>
in one act of kindness kousai was chatting with his wife on the prison phone and asked black if there was anyone he wanted to contact
<unk> wife called black's daughter on her cell phone and connected the two on the same phone line
it was the first time that black had been able to talk to someone outside of the prison or jail
his family finally knew first hand where he was and what had happened to him
as the weeks dragged on black became immersed in prison life
he walked the cell block halls to pass time often recalling humorous episodes of m a s h and <unk> to <unk> his spirits
he and the other prisoners told jokes or talked about funny movies to help inject humor in their otherwise serious world
when he got down about his situation many of the prisoners would ask him to join their conversations share cookies and boxed drinks they had bought from the <unk> or offer food they had cooked in their cells
if the prisoner didn't speak english a simple smile or thumbs up was offered
black was grateful for the acts of friendship and he made an effort to <unk> he said
meanwhile black's family friends and colleagues were raising money to hire an abu dhabi attorney and working official channels to get black released
they called themselves <unk> friends of alan black
the u.s. embassy sent representatives to meet with black several times while he was at al <unk>

black was the only <unk> in his cell block though he believes he saw a few others in the prison he said
besides a nigerian man he was the only christian

five times a day the devout would roll out their prayer mats
black never spoke much about religion with the other inmates he said and he never felt any animosity aimed toward him for being a christian
he had no biases against muslims and they had no <unk> about him
in fact many of the inmates told black they prayed he would be released soon he said

he was very passionate and forceful black said
he told the judges that he thought the case was an embarrassment and that i should have been fined and released the first day
the judges agreed and ruled black not guilty no intent to do harm
he was fined five hundred <unk> around one hundred and thirty five dollar dollars the minimum fine allowed by the court system
it was later waived because of time served
it took about twenty eight hours to get fully processed and black immediately made his way to the airport and flew back home to athens georgia
black was grateful about how quickly his case was ultimately resolved he said
some of the prisoners he met had been in prison for years and many still hadn't seen their case presented in court
the support of his family and friends was important black said but he considered prisoners such as kousai his angels
it was their generosity of spirit humor and kindness that made a bad situation <unk>
the episode reinforced black's belief that while differences exist among cultures in the end we are all human beings
sometimes it takes something like this to show you people will reach out when you need it he said
it's important to be open to your emotions and know people care

a yemeni official close to the presidential administration also told cnn that the presidential chief of staff had been detained by armed men linked to the houthi tribe
the official said they believed the detention was linked to disagreement over the constitution
this is force for political gain a ridiculous show of muscle flexing the official said
the abduction comes amid rising tensions in the arabian peninsula country following the rise of shiite houthi rebels
houthis swept into the capital last year sparking battles that left more than three hundred dead in a month
in september houthis signed a ceasefire deal with the government
since then its members have installed themselves in key positions in the government and financial institutions
adding to yemen's turmoil is al qaeda in the arabian peninsula a terror group that has been exploiting and stoking the instability
on saturday the houthi media outlet al <unk> repeated the group's claim of responsibility
the rebels further <unk> on their motives for the abduction in their statement
surely there are series of steps the resistance forces will conduct to stop those powers from negligence and to stop their criminal activities against the people today and in the future the rebels statement said posted on facebook
president hadi must understand the sensitivity of the current situation and not be an umbrella for corrupt and criminal powers the statement added
the uk ambassador to yemen and the u.s. embassy in sanaa called for bin mubarak's immediate release
very concerned about the kidnapping of dr ahmed bin mubarak
few have done more to support the two thousand and eleven revolution and ideals jane <unk> the british ambassador to yemen said on twitter
the revolution refers to months of demonstrations and crackdowns that led to civilian deaths in two thousand and eleven
toward the end of that year then president ali abdullah saleh resigned and powers were transferred to then vice president hadi
hadi was elected president in february two thousand and twelve
he was the only candidate on the ballot
the moves likely to meet resistance from republicans in congress are meant to pay for the long slate of new programs the president began laying out two weeks ago designed to bolster the middle class including offering two free years of community college to qualified students
obama's aides have been seeking ways to expand a robust economic recovery beyond top <unk> who have been buoyed by record closes on wall street
despite <unk> of positive economic news most americans still say economic conditions in the country are only fair
and if they see improvement they aren't crediting the white house
the middle class has yet to experience the prosperity shown in the recovery and what you'll see tuesday night is the vision for finishing that job a senior administration official said
obama is set to propose tuesday a five hundred dollar tax credit for married couples who each hold jobs
the intention officials say is to help alleviate the costs of child care and commuting that lead some spouses usually women to determine it makes more financial sense to stop working
he'll also spell out ways to simplify the way taxpayers apply for education and child care credits including increasing the top child care credit to three thousand dollar
the total cost for the new provisions
two hundred and thirty five billion dollar according to administration officials who spoke anonymously ahead of the <unk> official unveiling
for the first time since becoming president all of obama's changes would need to be approved both by a gop house and a senate with a new republican majority
to pay for the changes the administration is proposing about three hundred and twenty billion dollar in new revenue over the next decade
obama wants to <unk> more taxes from investment income capital gains and dividends which are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary earnings
since wealthy americans are more likely to <unk> income from investments they'd bear the overwhelming weight of a higher rate on that type of profit
the tax rate for capital gains now stands at twenty percents for the highest earning americans
officials said saturday that obama will call for that rate to increase to twenty eight percents for those taxpayers
he will ask lawmakers to close a loophole allowing capital gains on inherited funds to go untaxed a so called trust fund loophole the white house says allows billions of dollars in capital gains to go untapped by the government every year
this proposal is doing what it is intended to do which is to make sure that the large accumulated <unk> wealth of the wealthiest americans is actually subject to tax an obama administration official said
we are quite confident that we can do this in a way that <unk> that objective while in fact helping middle class families by putting those resources to better use
the arguments against raising tax rates on investment income are well established
opponents argue it poses a double tax scenario since the corporate profits that drive stock prices are already subject to taxes
and they stress some portion of investment gains is driven by inflation
but republicans aren't necessarily opposed to altering how investment income is taxed
last year's proposal from the top republican on the house tax writing committee rep. dave camp called for applying ordinary income tax rates on sixty percents of capital gains and excluding the other forty percents altogether
that put the top rate at twenty one percents
in his speech tuesday obama also plans to all for a new fee on large financial institutions which administration officials estimated would bring in one hundred and ten billion dollar
camp's plan called for an <unk> tax on large banks
i would say that a number of the ideas that the president is outlining in this new proposal do have already have clear congressional bipartisan support a senior administration official said saturday
republicans were dismissive of the tax initiatives unveiled saturday evening
this is not a serious proposal brendan buck spokesman for house ways and means chairman paul ryan told cnn
we lift families up and grow the economy with a simpler <unk> tax code not big tax increases to pay for more washington spending
obama has spent the last two weeks offering up an advance look at his state of the union address including the community college proposal a plan to expand high speed internet and reducing rates of federally backed <unk>
the early look is meant to introduce americans to each scheme individually said administration aides who determined the yearly laundry list of plans combined with updates on america's foreign policy wasn't <unk> during a single prime time event
that doesn't mean however the speech will necessarily be any shorter than the sixty five minute address obama delivered last year
it will still be a healthy speech in terms of breadth and length one official said
why obama's going to india after his state of the union speech
the recent spate of terror attacks and threats in europe has many wondering what the next target might be and how the danger can be mitigated
here are the latest developments
five belgian nationals have been charged with participation in a terrorist organization after police raided a suspect terror cell in verviers the country's federal prosecutor said
three are in custody and two have been released under strict conditions erik van der sypt said
and two additional suspects are in french custody after they were detained while trying to cross from france into italy through the frejus tunnel the prosecutor said
the suspected terror cell in verviers which included people returning from syria planned to target police officers van der sypt said
police said they recovered weapons bomb making materials and police uniforms
two suspects were killed in the police raid thursday and a third was injured and taken into custody
authorities have not released their identities
heavily armed guards filtered through the streets of brussels and antwerp on saturday a sight the country hasn't seen in thirty five years
why is belgium particularly vulnerable
the small country is believed to have more suspected jihadists per capita than any other country in western europe
greek authorities say they are cooperating with belgian authorities on an investigation and on sunday belgium requested the extradition of one of the suspects arrested in greece
greek police confirmed that there have been some arrests and are looking for other individuals but said that none so far were linked to the belgian plot
belgian federal prosecutor van der sypt however said the belgian investigation gave us enough reason to ask for the extradition of one of the persons that were arrested yesterday by the greek authorities
the investigation revealed that one of the people arrested in greece could be involved in the plot that was stopped in belgium van der sypt said
european counterterrorism agencies are scrambling to assess the potential terrorism threat from people with suspected links to islamic extremists
as many as twenty sleeper cells of between one hundred and twenty and one hundred and eighty people could be ready to strike in france germany belgium and the netherlands a western intelligence source told cnn
european union and middle east intelligence agencies identified an imminent threat to belgium and possibly to the netherlands the source told cnn
there is a tremendous amount of concern over sleeper cells in europe said a western official with direct knowledge of the situation
but while there is a realistic threat to the netherlands government spokesman <unk> <unk> said there is no concrete or specific information of an attack in the netherlands
two additional people whose dna was found on the belongings of jihadist amedy coulibaly are being sought by authorities according to a source in paris with knowledge of the investigation into this month's attacks in the french capital
the dna of one was found on a charger belonging to coulibaly the source told cnn
coulibaly is accused of killing four people in a siege at a kosher market and gunning down a police officer
meanwhile three women detained in connection with the paris terror attacks were released from custody sunday the public prosecutor's office told cnn
nine other people will remain in custody for at least forty eight hours while the investigation continues
the detainees were held after a series of terror attacks this month that left seventeen people dead including twelve people in an attack at the offices of the charlie hebdo satirical newspaper
al qaeda in the arabian peninsula al qaeda's yemen affiliate claimed responsibility for the charlie hebdo shooting
the publisher of charlie hebdo says the newspaper will increase the press run of the latest issue which features a depiction of the prophet mohammed to seven million
isis the extremist islamist group that controls swaths of iraq and syria runs large training facilities in syria and has access to thousands of potential european recruits
officials are monitoring groups of men who have returned to europe from fighting in syria
it is believed isis directed operatives to return to europe to launch attacks in retaliation for airstrikes against the terror group in syria and iraq according to the official
several european nations including the united kingdom france belgium and the netherlands are participating in the air campaign against isis in iraq

stuart loory eighty two died friday in his home in brooklyn new york after battling cancer
in addition to working as a correspondent loory oversaw cnn <unk> in washington and moscow
he later became a vice president of turner broadcasting system
but it hardly sums up his life which was about following his passion for a good story to various points on the map
<unk> was an excellent journalist and a great friend cnn founder ted turner said saturday
he was instrumental in helping to launch the first goodwill games in moscow a loyal executive and leader at cnn world report and of course was well known as one of the finest bureau chiefs at cnn running the first washington d.c. bureau and later opening the moscow bureau
he will be <unk> missed
he was the <unk> journalist said his son josh loory who also became a news producer
stuart loory got his start in the mid one thousand nine hundred and fifty s as a newspaper reporter at the newark evening news which is no longer in print
in one thousand nine hundred and fifty eight he moved to vienna austria on a pulitzer travel fellowship and took the family with him his son said
josh was three months old then
in the course of his father's career he would attend eight different schools in twelve years as they <unk> between moscow washington new york chicago and atlanta
the people that he knew and the circles that he traveled in were absolutely amazing his son said
josh loory remembers sailing with former secretary of state and diplomacy icon henry kissinger
before coming to cnn loory ran various operations for major daily newspapers
he reported on the white house for the los angeles times
he covered the end of the johnson administration and the nixon administration his son said
loory was included on <unk> enemies list of political opponents according to his biography on the website of the university of missouri where he taught from one thousand nine hundred and ninety seven on after leaving cnn
he had a passion for science which he wrote about at the new york times
he covered every manned space flight from mercury through <unk> his son said
before making the switch to tv journalism for cnn in one thousand nine hundred and eighty he was managing editor of the chicago sun times
cnn sent him back to moscow
former cnn news group chairman tom johnson said he never backed away from asking heads of state the most difficult questions
i saw that firsthand in white house press conferences with president johnson and in the kremlin with both presidents <unk> and <unk>
stuart was instrumental in obtaining exclusive cnn coverage with russian television as president <unk> resigned from office
he also was instrumental in arranging exclusive cnn russian <unk> first interview with boris <unk> after <unk> took office
in the bitter cold of moscow loory once reported wearing a huge hat and received a message telling him he'd look better if he left it off
loory answered with a funny tv report advocating for his giant <unk> russian fur hat
loory faced danger on the job as when he covered the civil rights movement in alabama in the one thousand nine hundred and sixty s
in montgomery he witnessed the beating the freedom riders got said another son adam loory
he said someone helped him get away from the <unk> by saying take off your tie and glasses and follow me
when he realized he was leaving the scene he said take me back i have to follow the story
back at the bus station he found john lewis on the ground bleeding and helped get him to a hospital

national <unk> valerie <unk> was devastated to see her brother <unk> image <unk> by police sniper bullets she told nbc six in an exclusive report
but his photo wasn't the only one of an african american being used for target practice last november
there were six bullet riddled <unk> of black males at the range
no says north miami beach police chief j. scott dennis
two of his snipers were using them for target practice one of them is hispanic and the other a black male of <unk> descent
their target a row of black men which the snipers left behind at the stand was one of many
there are also groups of white males hispanic males and white women
there are twenty two images in all including a white man holding a gun to a white woman's head and one of now dead al qaeda leader osama bin laden
the same target inventory has been used for more than a decade dennis said in a statement
the idea is to have an array of photos with faces that look similar so the sniper can practice exactly picking out the right target and avoid killing the wrong person in a real life situation dennis said
the department uses <unk> of people they arrested ten to fifteen years ago and woody <unk> was one of them
<unk> told nbc six that he was booked after a deadly drag race
he has walked the straight and narrow ever since he said
i can <unk> with the family discovering their brother's photo on the target dennis said
dennis became aware of the family being upset in late december and ordered an investigation
it turned up no violations of law or department policy
but things will change
we realize how important this issue is during today's climate dennis said
snipers will no longer use <unk> of people they have arrested but instead will buy practice pictures from commercial vendors
and they are instructed from now on to destroy their targets after they're done
it is with great sadness that we announce the passing of kim fowley independent music publisher peer music announced on its website thursday
with a career in the music business spanning over fifty years fowley was a <unk> unique figure in the <unk> of rock history
fowley worked with a wide range of artists including paul revere and the <unk> the modern lovers blue cheer kiss and helen <unk>
but he will be remembered in the rock and roll history books for helping form the california <unk> band the <unk>
that all female group which featured joan <unk> released four albums in the late one thousand nine hundred and seventy s. one of their hit songs was cherry bomb
the band which became an overnight sensation broke up in one thousand nine hundred and seventy nine
there was a <unk> quality to what he was trying to do with the <unk> rolling stone contributing editor anthony <unk> told cnn
he said <unk> group of the teenage girls being <unk> out there as <unk> turned out to be really inspiring
what started out as a joke became really serious
<unk> and her post <unk> group the <unk> are being <unk> in to the rock and roll hall of fame this year
joan <unk> tweeted kim was a friend he taught me so much
i am very sad
heavy metal singer sebastian <unk> tweeted rip my friend kim fowley the king of the night time world a true rock and roll character
<unk> pink a singer <unk> tweeted rip kim fowley
no words
prayers go out to his wife kara
his music life and spirit will continue to be an inspiration
british actor and musician michael des <unk> tweeted kim fowley <unk> <unk> and lover of rock n roll
i learned and laughed and was in awe of him for over forty years
in recent times billboard magazine reported that fowley was suffering from bladder cancer and in an interesting turn of events former <unk> singer <unk> <unk> cared for fowley during his fight with cancer
billboard reported their reconciliation came in two thousand and eight following years of legal battles over <unk> and harsh verbal <unk> in the press
fowley was known as a los angeles sunset strip character often dressing in outrageous suits and pitching his latest project
he would do anything to seize the moment he was kind of <unk> and you have to admire that said <unk>
it's necessary for a band to have charisma and it's necessary for a band to have a kim fowley in there someplace
the behind the scenes people are as much a part of rock n roll as the guys <unk>
kim fowley is a necessary evil he told the san diego reader in two thousand and twelve
last saturday a bomb strapped to a <unk> exploded in the center of maiduguri in borno state killing at least twenty people
then on sunday two girls simultaneously blew themselves up in a market in <unk> in yobe state killing three and injuring more than forty
it is clear that girls as young as ten are being lined up as suicide bombers to further boko haram's cause
and these new bombings come as boko haram has also caused outrage around the world with its indiscriminate massacre of innocent men women and children in the towns of baga and doron baga
indeed new photographs obtained by amnesty international show the devastation of more than three thousand seven hundred homes local shops local churches and their local schools
nothing it seems is <unk>
daniel <unk> nigeria researcher for amnesty international said this was the largest and most destructive boko haram assault his organization has ever seen
the nigerian government estimated one hundred and fifty people were killed but some widely reported private estimates put the figure as high as two thousand
days earlier on january four forty boys and young men ages ten to twenty three were abducted from a village in the nigerian state of borno
this <unk> destruction of even the most innocent of lives <unk> any illusion that boko haram will try to shield any civilian however young or however frail from its attacks and killings
as a result this year is poised to be a year of <unk> that could exceed the horrors of the last one
in november for example at least one hundred and twenty people were killed in a bomb attack on a central mosque in kano the principal city of northern nigeria
a few weeks earlier the terror group kidnapped at least ninety seven people including many children during raids on villages in borno state
when earlier in the year they invaded the northern village of <unk> boko haram militants went door to door killing any man woman or child they came across
and perhaps most infamously last year some two hundred and twenty girls were abducted from chibok by boko haram
sadly there has been no news on their whereabouts meaning none of these families know whether their daughters are safe
no one knows if his or her daughter has been married off raped violated or even whether she is alive or dead
every waking hour remains a nightmare for these families
boko haram's ever more violent and ever more vicious abuse of children as weapons of war as victims as slaves and as suicide bombers must be addressed because the threat is only likely to grow
after all the group's leader abubakar shekau who has a seven million dollar bounty on his head was seen last week in a video praising the jihadists who killed seventeen people in the paris attacks
the terrorism research and analysis consortium has described shekau as a religious intellectual yet also a <unk> and vigilante as well as a mad leader
with all this in mind i am urging the international community to step up its pursuit exposure and surveillance of boko haram and to do more to coordinate action against their cross border incursions into nigeria chad cameroon and other countries
following the kidnapping of more than two hundred schoolgirls in chibok a special initiative for children was launched the safe schools plan
it was in response to the news that children fearful of further terrorist attacks had been staying away from school
the idea behind this is admirable the notion of safe schools and a universal call for every child to have the right to education free of fear and intimidation
this plan is being put into place and steps are being taken to <unk> and guard schools to improve security and to create a line of communication between schools and police and army
these new initiatives are backed by the safe school guidelines passed by the united nations to stop the use of schools as military targets and to ensure that they are havens free from exploitation by terrorist groups
just as hospitals are regarded as protected under international law so should schools
while better <unk> will of course not ultimately stop the carnage if a terrorist group is <unk> on an attack the deterrent effect of enhanced security measures offers at least a first line of defense
and it also sends the important message to parents that everything possible is being done to make schools safer for their children
over the last few weeks twenty three million dollar has been raised for safe schools from the international community and in the last few days the united states and britain have announced further help for the initiative
but we are calling on all aid agencies to support this innovative plan one that could if applied round the world help children worried about the threat to their schools in countries from pakistan to lebanon
it is hard for many of us in the west to imagine what it is like to be scared even to travel to school yet too many children around the world confront that fear every day
it is time for that to change
the gop leader paired swift <unk> and gop arguments opposed to the proposal in a blog item posted to his site friday that quickly went viral
while the community college proposal sounded exciting at first boehner's staff writes paired with a gif of swift to illustrate the excitement when president obama said free what <unk> sixty billion dollars over ten years
not even all the taylor swift album sales in the world would cover that bill the post declares atop a gif of swift looking <unk>
the post goes on to suggest obama's proposal would either require a tax hike or else contribute to the national debt accompanied by clips from swift's music videos that range from infuriated to <unk>
instead boehner's office proposes
wouldn't it be better if we just worked together to lower costs for folks across the board and improve our children's education
as swift <unk> in a clip from an awards show
looks like an apology is in order mr. president the post continues
boehner spokesman michael steel told the daily dot the post was an effort to reach people where they are
we are always looking for fun effective ways to communicate with the american people about president obama's failed policies and our better solutions he said
swift is a safe pick for the party as it looks to expand its appeal to younger voters in time for the two thousand and sixteen elections
while swift has matured over her career she hasn't turned to <unk> moves or lyrics to shed her <unk> clean teen persona
indeed boehner's not the only republican to turn to taylor swift to say what their own words can't
newly minted iowa sen. joni ernst said she would shake it off when outgoing sen. tom harkin compared her to swift
and sen. ted cruz's digital strategist is a huge fan of the pop star

his family thanked fans in a written statement for the outpouring of support and continued well wishes
ali was initially released from the hospital on january seven after an eighteen day stay
born <unk> clay the fighter won an olympic gold medal as a light heavyweight at eighteen
in one thousand nine hundred and sixty four he became world heavyweight champion in an upset victory over <unk> <unk>
shortly thereafter he changed his name to muhammad ali to reflect his conversion to islam
the boxer was also known for his protest against the vietnam war and refusing to be drafted on religious grounds
he won his first thirty one professional fights before losing to joe frazier in one thousand nine hundred and seventy one a bout hailed by some boxing experts as one of the greatest of all time
he retired from boxing in one thousand nine hundred and eighty one as a three time heavyweight champion and announced his diagnosis with parkinson's three years later
one day after <unk> arrest belgian authorities took down a group they believed was plotting imminent attacks resulting in a battle with the suspects who opened fire with military weaponry and handguns
two of the suspects were killed
some members of the group had reportedly returned from fighting in syria with isis
the two cases could hardly be more different
in ohio we saw the arrest of a classic lone wolf allegedly inspired by isis with aspirations to carry out an attack but scant capabilities while in belgium we saw the <unk> of what appears to have been an isis cell with serious capacities for attack
this contrast can also be seen if we carefully analyze the tactics and characteristics of last week's paris attacks and compare them with the boston marathon bombing in two thousand and thirteen
in paris jihadist terrorists killed seventeen people in a series of attacks beginning with the assault on the offices of charlie hebdo followed by the killing of a policewoman and a hostage taking in a kosher grocery
the attacks received sustained global media coverage throughout the three days that they unfolded
in addition to the three shooters at least a dozen others are suspected of some kind of involvement in the paris attacks
the attackers had a substantial weapons cache including assault rifles <unk> cocktails a grenade and even a rocket propelled grenade
they also had bulletproof vests
two of the attackers had traveled to yemen where they received training from al qaeda in the arabian peninsula
the attacks in paris were the most deadly by jihadists in europe in a decade
the terrorists adopted so called <unk> those who sacrifice themselves tactics in which armed men assault targets with the intention of fighting to the death to <unk> the battle as long as possible thereby <unk> media coverage and the number of casualties
the most deadly example of such an attack were the assaults in mumbai india in two thousand and eight by ten pakistani <unk> e <unk> operatives which killed one hundred and sixty six people
similar to those in paris the mumbai attacks involved multiple targets the operatives were armed with assault rifles and the men had received training from a terrorist organization
the mumbai attacks lasted four days and they were <unk> covered by media from around the world
on the other end of the spectrum the boston marathon bombing provides an example of a less sophisticated attempt at a <unk> style attack
on april fifteen two thousand and thirteen <unk> and dzhokhar tsarnaev allegedly detonated two bombs along the route of the boston marathon killing three people
three days later the <unk> allegedly shot and killed a police officer at the campus of the massachusetts institute of technology and in the early morning of april nineteen the <unk> had an intense firefight with police in which <unk> was killed and dzhokhar was wounded and later taken into custody
as was the case in paris the boston bombers had multiple targets and the attackers appear to have intended to conduct attacks until they died
however the bombers were not trained abroad by a terrorist group
they were not part of a larger group of <unk> and they were not as well armed as the paris <unk>
the paris terrorists were more sophisticated in their tactics and training than the boston bombers but the paris attacks were far less sophisticated than the attacks in mumbai
the terrorists in mumbai received direction on their cell phones throughout their assault from their commanders who were manning a control room in pakistan
the mumbai attacks also involved a larger number of people the ten gunmen who <unk> india as well as many others who provided training and support from pakistan during the attack
the paris attacks were in short a hybrid of the terrorist tactics that we saw in boston with the tactics we saw in mumbai
u.s. security officials warn that the united states is at risk of similar attacks to those that occurred in paris
attorney general eric holder told cnn's state of the union what we saw in france over the course of this last week is unfortunately what we're going to have to confront in the future
the united states is certainly at risk of some version of a paris like attack using <unk> style tactics
after all a much less sophisticated version the boston attacks in two thousand and thirteen has already happened
however the history of jihadist plots inside the united states since nine eleven suggests that the combination of terrorist characteristics and tactics that we saw in the paris attacks would be unusual in the united states
in none of the deadly attacks conducted in the united states since nine eleven have the participants received training from terrorist organizations abroad
carlos <unk> who killed a u.s. soldier in little rock arkansas in two thousand and nine
maj. nidal hasan who killed thirteen at fort hood texas the same year
and the boston bombers were all so called lone <unk> none of whom had training or direction from a terrorist organization
these are in marked contrast with france
as the new york times notes thousands of french citizens have traveled to fight in syria or iraq and two hundred have returned a far less manageable challenge than the one hundred and fifty or so americans who have reportedly gone or attempted to go to fight in the syrian conflict
of those americans only about a dozen have joined jihadist groups according to fbi director james <unk>
this is not to say that holder's warnings should be dismissed
firearms are of course widely available in the united states and one can certainly imagine a jihadist group forming to conduct an armed assault
a few such plots involving more than one or two lone <unk> have been foiled in the united states although none in the past few years
in two thousand and nine for instance the fbi arrested a group of seven men in north carolina led by daniel boyd who had amassed firearms and plotted attacks in the united states
the plot was foiled because informants had long monitored it after <unk> activities came to the fbi's attention in two thousand and five
perhaps the closest the united states came to seeing an armed assault similar to the one in paris was in two thousand and five when kevin james <unk> washington <unk> <unk> <unk> and gregory patterson plotted attacks on a number of locations in california including synagogues
the group was arrested after law enforcement linked the members to a robbery
the militants had no links to foreign terrorist organizations
nor is the united states immune to plotting by individuals with training by terrorist groups abroad
in two thousand and nine three men <unk> zazi <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> all of whom received weapons training in pakistan's tribal areas plotted to bomb the new york subway but were arrested before they could do so
similarly in two thousand and ten faisal <unk> who was trained in pakistan tried to blow up an suv in times square
the bomb failed to detonate properly
given this history it would be <unk> to ignore holder's warnings of the potential of paris like attacks inside the united states
however there are real differences between the scale of the threat from terrorists in the united states compared with the scale of the threat in france and american policymakers and commentators should be careful to make those differences clear when speaking to the public
in a statement posted to its google plus account the company said it would still be working on smart glasses but that january nineteen would be the last day to get the current glass explorer edition
the statement explained that google glass will graduate from the google x incubator and become its own division which will report to nest founder tony fadell
glass has been on sale since two thousand and thirteen in the united states and allows the user to send messages navigate and record video using voice commands
but since its launch glass has come up against safety and privacy issues
some agreed it was time for a revamp
others saw it as a positive development for glass
many had their own views on why production had been stopped
but whatever the response it's unlikely that this is the end of google glass
nick thompson editor of the new yorker dot com told cnn that glass may well be back in a year or so revamped and redesigned
and he is confident that fadell is the right man for the job

nobody around the world least of all the iranians doubt my ability to get additional sanctions pass if these negotiations fail obama added later
cameron said he was also calling american senators and urging them not to pass additional sanctions
the wide ranging joint press conference covered issues as global as the terror attacks in france to as beltway as what obama thinks about his one time opponent mitt romney considering another presidential bid
obama promised friday to do everything in our power to assist france in their effort to combat terrorism in the wake of the attacks that killed at least seventeen people across the country in the past week
we will continue to do everything in our power to help france seek the justice that is needed and that all our countries are working together seamlessly to prevent these attacks obama said
on iran obama turned a question on whether he'd veto additional sanctions on iran back on his counterparts in congress including those in his own party
why is it that we would have to take actions that would jeopardize the possibility of getting a nuclear deal over the next sixty or ninety days
obama asked
obama added later
i am not repeat not suggesting that we are on immediate war footing should negotiations with iran fail

new congress new nuclear showdown over iran
in a departure from the physical threats posed by those who attacked paris cameron and obama announced friday new cooperation on combating cyberattacks including cyber war games designed to identify vulnerabilities in banking networks
cameron is at the white house for bilateral talks expected to focus squarely on security after this month's terror attacks in paris and growing fears of violent islamic terror cells inside europe
cameron and obama addressed reporters in a joint press conference after their meeting friday
a british official said the two countries would establish cyber cells to share information and develop a system where countries and hostile states and hostile <unk> know that they shouldn't attack us
the move comes after high profile breaches at sony pictures and the u.s. central command ramping up concern about online safety
british officials say cameron flew to washington with cyber issues at the front of mind
cameron is worried that companies like google facebook and twitter are allowing terrorists to use their networks unseen by law enforcement
the companies say they have safeguards in place to ensure criminals and terrorists aren't allowed to communicate
cameron told <unk> in an interview that tech companies shouldn't provide a safe space for terrorists to communicate or plan attacks
the news conference will be the first time obama is questioned about the paris attacks and his failure to attend a unity march held in the french capital last weekend
the white house says it was a mistake not to send a higher profile administration official to the march
speaking thursday to reporters on the plane ride to the philippines the pope gestured with a fake punch to demonstrate what he would do if someone were to say a swear word against my mother
most journalists interpreted it as a joke not a justification of violence especially since the pope had also just forcefully stated that one can not kill in the name of god
still the vatican felt the need to clarify in response to a later cnn question about the punch that his words were spoken colloquially and consistent with the pope's free style of speech
i don't for one minute think the pope is advocating for any type of violence whether religiously motivated murder or sparring among friends who <unk> each other's <unk>
what concerns me is his apparent belief that religion should have special protection when it comes to free speech
one can not provoke one can not insult other people's faith one can not make fun of faith he said
there is a limit
every religion has its dignity
in freedom of expression there are limits
the pope responding to a general question about the <unk> between religious liberty and free expression was clearly referencing the massacre of journalists at charlie hebdo magazine by islamist militants in paris last week
although he did not say the slain cartoonists brought the attack upon themselves because of their satirical criticism of islam it's not a huge logical leap to that conclusion and raises the likelihood of such a <unk>
let's just say it's not what most public relations professionals would advise
and while the pope has been known to talk more informally with reporters on the papal plane he's still on the record and obviously aware that his words will be reported and analyzed
the pope is not the only prominent catholic raising the issue
bill <unk> a self appointed spokesman fighting anti catholicism as the president of the new york based catholic league released a statement with the headline muslims have a right to be angry on the day of the killings
on thursday his statement was headlined
pope sides with catholic league
such <unk>
while no one can match the offensive tone of <unk> who actually said charlie hebdo's stephane charbonnier didn't understand the role he played in his own death the <unk> of the pope's message was the same
criticism of religion is problematic
as an aside i'll be curious to see if those who slammed <unk> have the same harsh words for the pope
perhaps both of them should take a lesson from the response of another christian jim <unk> president of <unk> a progressive evangelical community and publication
he had a different suggestion for how people of faith should respond to the paris attacks
jesus tells us to bless those who <unk> us to return love for hate and good for evil and even to love our enemies <unk> wrote
loving your enemies certainly includes supporting the <unk> commitment to free speech and defending the right of free speech even or especially for those who offend you
i think most american catholics agree that while blasphemy offensive speech against god or religion is not particularly nice it does not follow that it can or should be regulated or outlawed
in the united states the supreme court outlawed blasphemy laws in one thousand nine hundred and fifty two
i'm hoping the pope was only offering counsel to his followers rather than advocating for any sort of legal position
no one has the right not to be offended
even the pope

the twenty seven year old is driving into the unknown after ending his rewarding relationship with red bull racing which powered him to four straight world titles and forty four grand prix victories
it was <unk> decision to quit red bull for ferrari a decision he said was partly inspired by a desire to follow in the footsteps of his racing idol michael schumacher
but despite his willingness to replace fernando alonso at ferrari the team suggested it was the new boss who persuaded vettel to a turn up for a first day at the office
the team said in a statement
at the request of team principal <unk> <unk> sebastian vettel came to <unk> to visit the <unk> <unk>
the purpose of the tour was to allow the four time world champion to visit all the departments and to get better <unk> with everyone he will be working with this season
vettel was seen wearing the distinctive <unk> colors of ferrari for the first time and ended his italian road trip by posing for a photograph with his new teammates
ferrari will unveil its car on january thirty ahead of the two thousand and fifteen season which starts in australia on march fifteen
it will take to the track for the first <unk> test in <unk> spain during the first four days of february
but there won't be a number one on <unk> <unk> that honor will go to mercedes rival lewis hamilton now a double world champion and instead vettel will race under the <unk>
that could be the least of the changes the german has to cope with in his unfamiliar circumstances
ferrari failed to win a race in two thousand and fourteen for the first time since one thousand nine hundred and ninety three and finished fourth in the <unk> standings
<unk> who was the third man to occupy the position of ferrari team principal in two thousand and fourteen has set vettel and his teammate kimi raikkonen a target of at least two race victories in the coming season
vettel brings with him the experience of winning <unk> who joined from american tobacco company <unk> morris said at a media conference in december
he is well equipped for the job that awaits him

but in his pitch to unseat sepp blatter and become the next president of fifa those qualities lasted about as long as the glossy <unk> to announce his candidacy
in public relations terms this was not a roaring success
suspicions had been raised by news the former paris saint <unk> and tottenham player's bid for soccer's top job was being funded by a well known bookmaker with a self confessed penchant for outrageous publicity stunts
the revelation that ginola was being paid two hundred and fifty thousand for his involvement with another one hundred thousand earmarked for the football <unk> security allied to his <unk> when <unk> questions about world football's governing body and the detail of his campaign did little to <unk> the skepticism
i'm here today to talk about love
i'm here to share some of the most powerful emotions any of us have experienced was the forty seven year old's <unk> opening <unk>
that is what football means to me you and the billions of fans across the planet
that's why we're so disappointed when we talk about some of the problems with the way our game is being run
it's time to change that
it's time to reboot football
ginola briefly touched on a few key themes of his campaign
complete financial transparency as well as more funding for grassroots soccer and the women's game
but his bid to reboot football could fall at the first hurdle unless he can persuade five fifa football associations to back him before the end of january and <unk> his candidacy
his campaign team also have some work to do in <unk> ginola's knowledge of football politics it would seem
<unk> on the issue of third party ownership of clubs or challenged to name some of fifa's executive committee members he was unable to offer any tangible answers
we are just at the beginning of the journey he replied
there are a few issues i will have to deal with and i think we are going to get to it in the next few days
even if ginola attracts the five backers he needs he must then face the seemingly insurmountable task of <unk> current incumbent blatter
fifa's president is in the seventeen th year of his reign and enjoys overwhelming support from the majority of organization's two hundred and nine members despite persistent allegations of corruption surrounding the bidding process for the two thousand and eighteen and two thousand and twenty two world cups
ginola is <unk> though insisting he didn't want to fight against the man himself but that a positive campaign would strike a chord with football fans all over the globe
there is no room for doubt in football ginola said
if we can not remove all suspicion or doubt there can not be trust
i want fifa to be seen as an example all around the world
it's the most popular game and it must set an example for everyone on earth
there are three things that are very important to me
transparency democracy and equality
if ginola's fee raised eyebrows they were <unk> ever more at the request for fans to back their support with cold hard cash
his team estimating that two point three million will be required to run a full and proper crusade for office
betting company paddy power kick started the funding for the project and its <unk> when it comes to publicity stunts prompted many people to dismiss ginola's bid as its latest attempt to grab column inches
in two thousand and ten they offered odds on which animal would be driven to extinction first by the oil spill in the gulf of mexico and last year promised money back if he walks relating to the trial of <unk> south african <unk> oscar pistorius
we've been known for some <unk> activity around the world paddy power son of one the company's founders and its marketing spokesman explained
this is not that
this is for real
what we bring is maybe the muscle to get the ball rolling but this is going to be crowd funded and hopefully the fans will get behind it and join the team
we've provided the platform now it's up to us to stand back and hand it over to the fans to make it happen
also part of the team ginola launch was david <unk> a sports lawyer who told cnn the move was revolutionary in terms of fifa's presidential race as it mapped out exactly where the funds would be <unk>
if you live in the real world you have to pay bills he said of paddy power's involvement
we're going to be honest and tell you what we're paying to who nobody else is doing that
the irony is that so far the david ginola campaign is the only one to do so and that has brought criticism
we have real transparency and real democracy at play here
ginola vowed to flesh out the detail of his campaign in the coming days and weeks as his team sets its sights on lobbying for those five required votes
but amid the soaring rhetoric and yes we can mentality there was still an air of distrust in the media pack relating to paddy power's role
journalist owen gibson who writes for the guardian newspaper told cnn
personally i'm deeply uneasy about the paddy power connection
it's toxic because they are well known for their stunts and getting into the news in any way they can
it's a win win for them they get plenty of pr and it's a win for david because he gets his fee
the danger is for those people who do want to see a genuine alternative
on the plus side we're getting these issues debated and talking about how things might change
on the flip side you've got the practical obstacles of getting five nominations by end of the month and the cynicism that will be generated by the fact it's backed by a major bookmaker with a reputation for controversy and stunts
gibson who thought some of the questions directed at ginola with the aim of <unk> him up were unfair said it was highly unlikely the <unk> bid would represent a real challenge to blatter
slim to none would be a good way of <unk> up ginola's chances he said
if paddy power were running the book it'd be interesting to see what odds they'd give you on him getting a nomination let alone winning the thing
jerome champagne has been going for a year and is struggling to get over that hurdle
that's going to be a huge task for them in three weeks to get the required nominations
but ginola's optimism refused to <unk> as he conducted round after round of media interviews <unk> in a sharp blue suit
it is a serious challenge and i do care ginola told cnn
i think it is brave to embrace this challenge
i knew there would be tough questions
on the involvement of paddy power he said
<unk> are in the game and today thanks to them we have this opportunity to launch this campaign
david ginola is perfect man to front the bid <unk> added
this a real footballer raising his hand in a brave fashion saying i'm willing to represent the fans
it's a political game
no one has more charisma more charm or the people skills that david ginola has
if we didn't think we had a real shot at getting five nominations we wouldn't waste anyone's time
we respect the fans time they've got better things to do than deal with stunts
none of those
well what about aberdeen then
when people talk about the <unk> it tends to be through a bit of a nostalgic haze
remember those one thousand nine hundred and eighty s days when they broke the old firm stranglehold as the club alex ferguson managed before joining manchester united
<unk> scottish title winners
aberdeen <unk> in europe
it's all a long time ago but maybe we're on the brink of some sort of <unk>
you have to go back to one thousand nine hundred and eighty four eighty five for the last time aberdeen won the scottish league title but now they're top and four points clear of celtic and although the defending champions have a couple of games in hand aberdeen are flying
their last eight scottish premier league games have brought victories and clean sheets that's six hundred and thirty minutes of league football in which they haven't conceded a goal
their last <unk> league game a two one setback at home to celtic came in early november
that sort of defensive defiance is <unk> anywhere
only french outfit st <unk> and <unk> club <unk> can come close
st <unk> have <unk> together a sequence of six clean sheets and <unk> seven
so what's the secret
it's probably just a combination of a few things getting back to basics and looking at our shape <unk> more on what we are doing when the opposition has the ball aberdeen manager derek mcinnes told cnn
the biggest drain on confidence is conceding cheap goals that mean you drop points
the biggest way of gaining confidence is getting a few clean sheets on the spin
mcinnes is quick to stress that although the spotlight inevitably falls on his team's defence and goalkeeper <unk> is a collective effort describing their sequence of results as a reflection of the whole team
he adds
it's an unusual run but you should always strive to improve
last year our defensive record was excellent and now we are building on that
and there has been stability in personnel
any time a team has a good defensive record consistency of selection helps
scottish football hasn't had the happiest of times in recent years
dwindling <unk> and the <unk> of powerhouse club rangers <unk> at the end of the two thousand and eleven twelve campaign added to a growing feeling of crisis
rangers re formed were admitted to the fourth tier of the scottish game at the start of the following season robbing the top division for the time being at least of its old firm rivalry
but the continuing resurgence of aberdeen has added a vibrant splash of color to this season as expectations that celtic would stroll to another title have so far been <unk>
their <unk> have never dipped below ten thousand hitting a high point of a little over nineteen thousand for <unk> visit
asked whether his <unk> challenge has <unk> up interest in the scottish top flight mcinnes says
in terms of stature the perception of the league will be better when the <unk> clubs <unk> and hearts and rangers all three are currently in the second tier are back
but there are a lot of good stories <unk> united <unk> hamilton and ourselves are up there challenging
we're glad to be in the fight and i'm really pleased with what the players have given me
familiarity has helped aberdeen develop their <unk> defense with mark reynolds andrew <unk> ashton taylor and goalkeeper scott brown all having played in each game of a run that has taken the team's overall goals against record to just seventeen in twenty one matches
but it's not just about that says central defender taylor a summer arrival from english league two club <unk> rovers
we are putting our bodies on the line to stop the ball going into the net he told <unk> press and journal
i tend to focus on what i have to do against each player while we have got a lot of good players in front of us who can score goals in any game
i certainly didn't think i would keep so many clean sheets keeper brown told the paper
i've always wanted to better myself and push myself as hard as i can and i thought i could do that with aberdeen
a big part of the appeal was to have legendary aberdeen goalkeeper jim leighton working with me as goalkeeper coach
it's all a far cry from earlier in the season when mcinnes was getting hot under the collar
because aberdeen were conceding too many avoidable goals
speaking after a three zero defeat at hamilton <unk> in october he said
we as a team know we can't go through the season losing cheap goals if we want to be successful
losing soft goals is something that has to be dealt with
we need to make better decisions and we need to show far more determination when we are defending
now aberdeen are targeting the world's best winning league streak currently held by <unk> nacional with twelve consecutive victories
but neither mcinnes nor his players are talking publicly about their chances of becoming champions of scotland again after twenty years there's a long way to go we'll take one game at a time that sort of thing
former rangers west <unk> <unk> and <unk> united player mcinnes guided the club to their first <unk> in nineteen years when they beat <unk> <unk> <unk> in the scottish league cup final last year
and with his side flying high it's no surprise that he's the current scottish <unk> manager of the month
he believes the fact that the scottish game gives chances to home grown managers has offered them an environment in which to flourish with former hamilton <unk> boss alex neil the latest to be <unk> by an english club when he joined <unk> city earlier this month
i got an opportunity as a player manager at st <unk> first of all he says
people get chances to build teams and alex neil did <unk> well
he was <unk> in that club and the biggest compliment you can pay him is that his team was like an extension of him very competitive very disciplined
you knew it would be tough against them
it's not only in the scottish top flight that things are looking up new national manager gordon <unk> has also brought renewed optimism to the scotland team
we've had a few players involved in scotland <unk> and the challenge for them is to force their way into a team that's doing well mcinnes says
there is a good spirit there and i think there's more to come from them
there could be even more to come from aberdeen too
the national climatic data center a division of the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noted the average temperatures over land and oceans were higher in two thousand and fourteen than any year since one thousand eight hundred and eighty when record keeping began
last month also had the third highest average global land temperature out of any december in the past one hundred and thirty five years at two point four five degrees f above average according to the agency
the announcement marks the third time the past decade has produced record setting warmth on an annual basis
but two thousand and fourteen's warmth was historic and it surpassed the prior records in two thousand and five and two thousand and ten the agency said
when two thousand and fourteen is compared with the twenty th century average the margin is much greater
last year's average temperature over land and sea was one point two four f above the last <unk> average the agency said
that figure marked a moment in the planet's recorded history
this was the highest among all one hundred and thirty five years in the one thousand eight hundred and eighty two thousand and fourteen record surpassing the previous records of two thousand and five and two thousand and ten the agency said
the federal report described how widespread was the blanket of warmth
record warmth was spread around the world including far east russia into western alaska the western united states parts of interior south america most of europe stretching into northern africa parts of eastern and western coastal australia much of the northeastern pacific around the gulf of alaska the central to western equatorial pacific large swaths of northwestern and southeastern atlantic most of the norwegian sea and parts of the central to southern indian ocean the report said
but the heat hardly means any loss of winter for some near polar climates
snow cover in the northern hemisphere in two thousand and fourteen was near the middle of the historical record the report said citing data from noaa analyzed by the <unk> university global snow lab
the first half of two thousand and fourteen saw generally below normal snow cover extent with above average coverage later in the year the report said

drinking moderately comes with a wealth of health benefits says sam zakhari senior vice president of the <unk> spirits council and former director of the division of metabolism and health effects at the national institute on alcohol abuse and alcoholism
studies show drinking red wine in moderation is good for your heart
research from harvard has shown it can reduce your risk of coronary heart disease
beer is also high in antioxidants research shows which may also help prevent age related eye diseases
another harvard study found that middle aged women who drink in moderation have a better chance than <unk> of staying healthy as they age
here's what you'll want to know about how alcohol affects you when you're drinking in moderation and what happens when you wake up knowing that last cocktail was definitely not a good idea
dailyburn
how many calories are in your cocktail
so here are six things to know about drinking before you go out tonight
a study from cancer research uk suggests that the average british adult might drink around three thousand seven hundred and forty calories of beer or three thousand seven hundred and fifty calories of alcohol at parties over the holiday season
even though twenty seven percents of the eighteen to twenty four year olds and thirty three percents of the twenty five to thirty four year olds surveyed said they had been known to skip a meal to make room for drinking they still ended up <unk> so much that it would have taken seven hours of jogging to work off all that seasonal cheer
so how much should you be drinking anyway
defined by the u.s. dietary guidelines for americans moderate drinking is no more than one drink per day for women and no more than two for men says zakhari
reality check
that means twelve ounces of beer one point five ounces of spirits or five ounces of wine
go forth and enjoy
if you're trying to lose weight or get in shape which type of alcohol should you order
you've got options says dr. david sack ceo of promises treatment centers
in terms of sheer calorie count beer has the most about one hundred and fifty calories
however if you opt for light beer that's about one hundred calories which is about the same as a serving of wine or liquor says sack
beer usually has around ten to twenty grams of carbs although strong sweet beers have more while <unk> and <unk> have the least according to sack
if wine is your thing a glass of red only has two grams of carbohydrates and keep in mind that drier wines will have fewer carbs and less sugar
hard liquor actually comes in at zero sugar and carbs
that might seem like a win but it all depends how you drink it
just watch the <unk> recommends sack
there's a big difference between straight vodka and the vodka in a <unk> which is paired with sugary <unk> juice
let's be honest
going overboard on drinks can make your brain feel foggy at best or short a few brain cells at worst
keep your bar tab under control and you might actually be doing your brain a favor
drinking moderate amounts of alcohol throughout your life can actually ward off cognitive decline and improve brain function says zakhari
research in the journal of alzheimer's disease found that of four hundred and eighty nine women studied moderate drinkers scored higher than <unk> women or heavy drinkers on a cognitive functioning test
decline in cognition is usually due to the brain not receiving enough oxygen explains zakhari
alcohol makes the blood more fluid which helps the blood supply to the brain remain constant
does the type of alcohol matter
<unk>
according to zakhari it's about the actual alcohol not the form it comes in
every year approximately eight hundred thousand people in the u.s. suffer from strokes according to the u.s. centers for disease control and prevention
but your nightly drink might make you less likely to someday become a part of that statistic
<unk> blood <unk> effect can help ward off strokes
zakhari explains that there are two types of strokes
ischemic when a blood clot stops blood from going to parts of the brain and hemorrhagic when the brain <unk> too much
around eighty percents of strokes are ischemic which is where alcohol comes in
moderate drinking helps reduce the <unk> of blood so there's less of a possibility of a blood vessel being clogged says zakhari
and then even if a clot does happen alcohol can help with <unk> which is the <unk> of the clot
if you <unk> before bed you might help yourself nod off but you're not doing your body any favors in the long run
alcohol may help you sleep now but you'll likely pay for it by being <unk> later says sack
<unk> beverages can disrupt what's known as sleep <unk> the process that helps your body regulate sleep according to research in the journal alcohol
while alcohol is a <unk> or sleep <unk> it can also disrupt you in the middle of the night
then there's the fact that relying on alcohol to help you sleep can lead to problems down the road
what tends to happen is that alcohol works less and less well as a sleep aid over time so we respond by increasing the amount we are drinking says sack
here's an excellent reason to keep yourself in check
<unk> it even once <unk> you read that right can affect your health in <unk> ways says research in the journal plos one
binge drinking is a pattern of drinking that brings blood alcohol concentration levels to zero point zero eight according to the national institute on alcohol abuse and alcoholism
that's about four or more drinks for women and five or more drinks for men within about two hours
in the study researchers discovered binge drinkers had bacterial dna in their <unk> which was a sign bacteria had leaked out from the gut
they also discovered elevated <unk> presence in the blood which meant toxins had been released from cells after cell walls were damaged by booze
the consequences
these toxins could lead to fever tissue destruction and inflammation which is tied to a host of health problems from cancer to depression
it sounds scary but avoiding these issues is pretty simple if you follow <unk> alcohol mantra
it's all about moderation

the women's champion was less surprising in the form of the now retired li na
with this year's opening grand slam starting monday here are seven things to watch as the tennis season bursts into life
if rafael nadal wins in melbourne he might cherish his second title more than his first
that's because after beating roger federer in a thrilling five set final in two thousand and nine melbourne park has been less than kind to the fourteen time grand slam champion on the health front
check out this list
in two thousand and ten he retired with a knee injury a year later he suffered a hamstring injury in his quarterfinal and last year a back problem surfaced while warming up for the final
it was the clear turning point and wawrinka took advantage
it was his long time rival federer who wept after losing to nadal in two thousand and nine but it was the <unk> turn to cry in two thousand and fourteen
nadal hasn't competed at a grand slam since wimbledon having skipped the u.s. open with a wrist complaint and his buildup has been marred by two bad losses in the middle east
but friday's draw for two thousand and <unk> first major was kind to nadal
he appears to have a smooth path to the semifinals
should nadal somehow be the last man standing only two triumphs would separate him and seventeen time grand slam winner federer
if it was an odd numbered year over the last decade chances are that serena williams won the australian open
she took home the title in two thousand and three two thousand and five two thousand and seven and two thousand and nine
there was the ankle she hurt at a warm up tournament in two thousand and twelve that led to a fourth round exit in melbourne
in two thousand and thirteen a back injury was probably to blame for a quarterfinal loss and last year the back flared up again in the quarterfinals
williams play early in two thousand and fifteen is sure to have worried her fans too
the eighteen time grand slam singles winner complained of a lack of energy at the <unk> cup in <unk> and subsequently split two of her four singles matches
like nadal williams longest grand slam drought now happens to be in melbourne
she won the u.s. open in september by topping her <unk> caroline wozniacki but they can't face off in the australian open final since they're in the same quarter
<unk> bid for one more major
with nadal's performances <unk> world no
one novak djokovic getting off to a less than stellar start in two thousand and fifteen and andy murray struggling for grand slam form the thirty three year old federer can't be discarded
while federer didn't have to face any of his fellow big four members as he shone in brisbane where he collected his one thousand th match win he defeated two players thought of as outside grand slam contenders in two thousand and fifteen
he dispatched <unk> raonic in the final having routed <unk> dimitrov in the semifinals
aiding federer would have been a kind draw but unfortunately for him it didn't happen
he found himself in the same quarter as murray and same half as nadal
can the <unk> army propel <unk> bouchard to glory
although she showed flashes in two thousand and thirteen last year in melbourne was when the tennis world truly took note of the twenty year old
her semifinal showing wasn't an <unk> with bouchard then reaching the last four at the french open and the final at wimbledon
but bouchard couldn't duplicate her success from august <unk> the low point perhaps coming at the year end championships where she failed to win a set in her three matches
fatigue no doubt played a role
bouchard arrives in melbourne this year without a permanent coach and you wonder how high her confidence is
only the <unk> wouldn't be happy that del <unk> is back playing tennis
skipping most of last year with further wrist troubles his supporters must have been holding their breath when the argentine pulled out of brisbane
but he returned in sydney this week unsure of how his left wrist would cope and made the quarterfinals
the pain hasn't gone away yet he said
none of the contenders would want to face del <unk> early though only the very optimistic would suggest he could win a second major over the coming fortnight
maybe claiming a few rounds and coming through the tournament <unk> would be enough for him
he doesn't face a top ten player in his opener but it's still an enticing and imposing encounter
the six foot six tower of <unk> plays two thousand and thirteen wimbledon <unk> <unk> <unk> who stands six foot eight
in an era where players on the women's tour all seem to be towering six <unk> <unk> halep five foot six is an exception
she still packs a punch from the baseline but it's her use of angles that so often gets her into winning positions in rallies
her backhand is one of the best around
if <unk> breakthrough was in two thousand and thirteen she went one better last year by making the difficult jump into the top ten and top five
how close was the romanian to winning the french open
very
she extended one of the game's top competitors sharapova to six four in the third set of the final
halep the most clicked on player on the <unk> website last year began this year with a title in shenzhen
who is the top australian hope
the rankings will tell you it's samantha <unk> who like del <unk> is a u.s. open winner
she's the world no
twenty on the women's tour
but <unk> has never really flourished at the australian open and she hasn't been shy to admit that nerves have been a huge factor
only once since two thousand and seven has <unk> armed with arguably the best second serve in the women's game exceeded the third round
australians are probably banking on nick kyrgios the athletic nineteen year old who stunned nadal at wimbledon to have an extended run
kyrgios chose to take a break in september saying he was burnt out and injuries have crept up
he missed the <unk> cup with a sore back
so expecting too much from kyrgios may be a mistake
the eleven year old mystery of what happened to the uk sponsored beagle two mars lander on its trip to the red planet's surface appeared to be mostly solved friday with the announcement the craft had been spotted in high resolution nasa images taken from orbit
the lander crammed with devices to look for signs of life on mars never <unk> home after <unk> a ride aboard the european space agency's mars express orbiter and dropping into the atmosphere on december twenty five two thousand and three
the images appear to show that the <unk> solar panels didn't fully open after landing preventing the craft from getting power and exposing the antenna it would have used to communicate with controllers on earth according to the space agency
while the reasons for that failure remain unknown the discovery of the lander helps solve one of the most enduring mysteries in martian exploration said mark <unk> a beagle two team member from the university of leicester
every christmas day since two thousand and three i have wondered what happened to beagle two he said adding that he'd almost given up hope of ever knowing what had come of the lander
the highly complex entry descent and landing sequence seems to have worked perfectly and only during the final phases of deployment did beagle two unfortunately run into problems he said
the lander which is less than two meters across when fully deployed was first spotted in the nasa images by michael croon of <unk> germany a former member of the european space agency's mars express operations team the uk space agency said
croon is among a group of beagle two team members who have spent years <unk> through images from nasa's <unk> camera which is on the agency's mars reconnaissance orbiter looking for signs of the missing craft the agency said
he found it in an area near the planned landing zone an impact basin called <unk> <unk> close to the martian equator
the grainy images appear to show the lander resting on the surface its solar panels only partially deployed
the <unk> rear cover and parachutes are nearby
had the lander deployed properly a suite of onboard tools would have been used to analyze rocks soil and atmosphere for signs of life
the lander the first european craft sent to the martian surface was named after the <unk> beagle the ship that carried charles darwin on a groundbreaking five year scientific survey
while its namesake resulted in no such breakthroughs david parker chief executive of the uk space agency said the discovery proves the beagle two had its successes
the history of space exploration is marked by both success and failure he said
this finding makes the case that beagle two was more of a success than we previously knew and undoubtedly an important step in europe's continuing exploration of mars
the charlie hebdo app features the so called survivors issue of the satirical magazine which sold out within minutes in france and across europe this week
versions are available for ios android and windows phone
once downloaded users can purchase the latest edition for two dollar point ninty nine
twelve people including several of france's most famous cartoonists were massacred at charlie hebdo's paris office last week by gunmen who claimed the attack was retribution for the magazine's notorious cartoon caricatures of islam and the prophet mohammed
thousands of people waited outside newsstands on wednesday some lining up before dawn to buy the new issue in a show of solidarity with the surviving members of charlie hebdo's staff
the magazine initially planned to publish three million copies of the issue fifty times the magazine's typical weekly circulation of sixty thousand but upped it to five million as demand <unk> supply at stores across europe
as shops ran out of copies charlie hebdo columnist patrick <unk> wrote on twitter thank you and rest assured we will <unk> and <unk>
on friday hundreds of people still hoping to get their hands on a copy waited outside the french <unk> in west london which had limited sales of the in demand issue to one copy per person
one customer who identified herself as ashley had arrived at the shop at six thirty a.m. she told cnn
i'm an artist and a musician so freedom of expression and speech is very vital to me
i'm going to get my french <unk> to translate it for me and i'm probably going to keep it as a <unk> another customer who identified herself as emily told cnn as she left the shop with her copy
the cover of the latest edition features a cartoon of a tearful prophet mohammed holding a banner that says je suis charlie a message of support for those killed that spread from social media to the streets of europe last week and a headline that declared all is forgiven
any depiction of islam's prophet is considered blasphemy by many muslims and the latest edition received mixed reviews from the muslim community
my initial thought is that the cover is a near perfect response to the tragedy said hussein <unk> a professor of islamic thought at <unk> university in new york
they are not backing down from the depiction of mohammed exercising their free speech rights
at the same time the message is conciliatory humble and will hopefully reduce the anger directed to the muslim communities of france
<unk> adel ibrahim an imam in australia took a dim view of the latest cover but urged his one hundred thousand facebook followers to follow the example of mohammed
as it is clear that the cartoons are to be published again muslims will inevitably be hurt and angered but our reaction must be a reflection of the teachings of the one we love and are angered for ibrahim said
enduring patience tolerance <unk> and mercy was the character of our beloved prophet
charlie hebdo is no stranger to controversy
in november two thousand and eleven the magazine's office was burned down on the same day it was due to release an issue with a cover that appeared to poke fun at islamic law
the cover cartoon depicted a bearded and <unk> cartoon figure of the prophet mohammed with a bubble saying one hundred lashes if you're not dying of laughter
in september two thousand and twelve despite the ongoing global furor over the anti islam film innocence of muslims the magazine published an issue featuring a cartoon that appeared to depict a naked mohammed along with a cover that appeared to depict a muslim man being pushed in a wheelchair by an orthodox jew
french and american officials expressed dismay with the decision and france closed embassies and schools in about twenty countries temporarily as a precaution
charlie hebdo journalist laurent leger who survived last week's deadly attack defended the magazine at the time saying the cartoons were not intended to provoke anger or violence
the aim is to laugh leger told bfm tv in two thousand and twelve
we want to laugh at the extremists every extremist
they can be muslim jewish catholic
everyone can be religious but extremist thoughts and acts we can not accept
in france we always have the right to write and draw
and if some people are not happy with this they can sue us and we can defend ourselves
that's democracy leger said
you don't throw bombs you discuss you debate
but you don't act violently
we have to stand and resist pressure from extremism
the incident in colombes a community about ten kilometers northwest of the french capital began at about twelve forty five p.m. and was over two hours later
the gunman might be mentally unstable according to police in colombes
police said that they don't know yet whether the incident is related to terrorism
this is a hot topic in france after last week's deadly attacks
a western intelligence source said there could be as many as twenty terrorist sleeper cells of between one hundred and twenty and one hundred and eighty people ready to strike in france germany belgium and the netherlands
the gunman eventually surrendered and the hostages emerged with no injuries according to france <unk> which is part of the country's public broadcasting group
raif badawi convicted on charges that included insulting islam had been scheduled to receive the second of twenty sentenced floggings after friday prayers in jeddah
he received the first flogging on january nine
a doctor who examined him before the scheduled flogging determined that his wounds had not yet healed and that the flogging should be delayed human rights group amnesty international said
the doctor concluded that the wounds had not yet healed properly and that he would not be able to withstand another round of lashes at this time amnesty international said in a statement
badawi's wife <unk> <unk> said from her home in canada that she expects the floggings to resume next friday
one of his friends ali <unk> said from toronto that the delay is definitely encouraging
none of us are completely satisfied he told cnn's new day
this is the saudi regime he said
we don't know what's going to happen from here <unk> but it's definitely a step in the right direction
rights groups and others including the u.s. state department have called for saudi arabia to call off the floggings the first of which appeared to be captured on unverified cell phone video uploaded to youtube
not only does this <unk> on health grounds expose the utter brutality of this punishment it underlines its outrageous <unk> said said boumedouha amnesty international's deputy middle east and north africa program director
badawi was convicted in two thousand and fourteen and sentenced to ten years in prison and one thousand lashes after creating an online forum in two thousand and eight that his wife says was meant to encourage discussion about faith
when more than two hundred girls were in april two thousand and fourteen kidnapped by boko haram terrorists from their school in chibok the international community rallied around nigeria
from michelle obama to <unk> keys to malala yousafzai personalities from across the globe lent their voices to the bringbackourgirls social media campaign
this response contrasted greatly to the relative apathy which followed what has been described by amnesty international as boko haram's deadliest attack the massacre of up to two thousand mostly women and children in baga town of northeast nigeria last week
at about the same time that the baga <unk> was making headlines around the world the international community was rallying around france in support against the terrorist attacks on the charlie hebdo newspaper offices in paris giving rise to the <unk> social media campaign
a simultaneous <unk> social media campaign has failed to gain much steam
the <unk> <unk> points out that a man can not expect you to both marry a wife for him and then buy the new couple a bed on which to sleep
similarly a country is expected to take responsibility and set sail with the winds of global support
france's president francois hollande was addressing the world's media and showing leadership within minutes of the attack
his government's efforts to hunt down the terrorists were broadcast for all the world to see
nigeria's president jonathan on the other hand waited two weeks before even offering a word on the chibok kidnappings
so far he has said nothing about baga
however president jonathan has issued a statement condemning the paris attacks
perhaps it is not that the nigerian government does not care about its own people
perhaps they simply want to spare us the <unk> of their public statements and <unk>
the perpetrators of this <unk> act shall be brought to book
no stone shall be left <unk>
god will punish them and their families
but who cares about words and worn out <unk>
action is what the nigerian people need
one year on the fact remains that despite predictions that they would be released imminently the more than two hundred missing girls have still not been found
the boko haram perpetrators rather than <unk> under the fire of the nigerian armed forces have become bolder
more women and girls have been kidnapped
boys have been kidnapped
communities in the northeast of nigeria are being raided and <unk> on an almost weekly basis
it is also possible that the nigerian government's <unk> is being <unk> as <unk> or inaction
maybe they do not believe that things are as bad as is being widely reported by the international media
last year president jonathan's wife patience openly <unk> the <unk> of the missing girls report
this week the nigerian defense ministry insisted that fewer than one hundred and fifty lives were lost in the baga attack as opposed to amnesty international's quoted two thousand
some nigerians i've listened to have also expressed their doubts about the two thousand figure
they believe that similar to the world <unk> assertion that more than sixty seven percents of nigerians are living in poverty the baga reports are all part of the international community's grand conspiracy to <unk> nigeria to make our country look bad
they insist that the international media in their quest to <unk> bad news from africa have simply latched on to an unverified casualty figure
unfortunately the nigerian media presumably not part of this grand international conspiracy are unable to provide us with enough alternative information
they are too busy covering the preparations for the forthcoming elections scheduled to take place in february
political rallies are beamed live on local tv and radio stations for hours every day
photographs of grinning politicians are splashed on newspaper front pages every morning their latest pronouncements and promises stealing all the headlines
current affairs programs and opinion pages are consumed with the <unk> or <unk> of either president jonathan or his main contender at the polls general <unk> <unk>
baga and other such will clearly have to take a back seat until after the elections
nevertheless the ongoing carnage in nigeria's northeast will definitely be a determining factor in the outcome of the february elections
a recent snap poll by nigeria's <unk> identified security as one of the key issues that nigerians want their president to focus on in two thousand and fifteen
i suspect that those nigerians who believe the relatively popular theory in certain ethnic circles that the rise in boko haram attacks are being orchestrated by unknown forces who want president jonathan out by all means will vote to keep him in just to prove a point to his enemies that their vicious efforts did not work
others who feel that jonathan is simply insensitive and incapable of handling the crisis will probably vote <unk>
whatever happens at the polls nigeria has to at some point face the boko haram issue squarely even after the international media frenzy around the group's latest attacks has died down as it surely will

there is the reported three hundred and thirty four thousand dollar a week salary the luxury homes and cars not to mention the <unk> from last season when manchester city won the premier league and the english league cup
yet despite that success including a fourth straight african player of the year title the city and ivory coast <unk> describes two thousand and fourteen as a horrible year
no wonder it's barely six months since his younger brother ibrahim died while toure and his brother <unk> were on world cup duty in brazil
as for what lies in store during two thousand and fifteen he's no idea
asked if he wants to stay put at city toure says in a wide ranging interview with cnn's amanda davies
that's a big question and that's an easy question as well and you have an easy answer
we'll see
pressed on whether he plans to still be at the <unk> stadium for the two thousand and fifteen sixteen premier league season he says
i don't know
i'm at city
city is a great club where i've achieved lots of things
those less than <unk> answers bring us to <unk> marie <unk> let them eat cake moment
after city's title triumph last season his agent <unk> <unk> said toure was upset that the <unk> birthday hadn't been properly acknowledged by the club
he got a cake but when it was <unk> <unk> birthday the president of <unk> gave him a <unk> <unk> reportedly said
sometimes it makes you disappointed when the story is going wrong says toure looking back on the episode
i don't want to open my heart up again and open my mind to the newspaper reports again because there have been such disappointing things running in the newspaper that have hurt me a lot
but i'm a guy who is very strong mentally
toure says he felt let down by certain individuals over how the story unfolded though he's not <unk> any names
however he is quick to credit the city supporters as well as chairman <unk> al mubarak and manager manuel <unk> for ensuring he felt loved again
though it's playing that provides the greatest solace
it's only football that keeps me peaceful adds toure
it's only the feeling of going after the ball that makes me happy
it's only once i see the city fans singing my name and the manager told me i want to cover to take more space it makes me feel happy and it's all i want
toure is very much a player who wears his heart on his sleeve and that becomes very apparent as he reflects on the highs and lows of two thousand and fourteen
the biggest low came while in brazil when news of <unk> death was broken to him over the phone by another of his brothers
for toure the tragedy still remains raw
two thousand and fourteen was i think i can say a horrible year for me
it was disappointing in the world cup
of course we won the premier league and the cup this year but i think with the death of my brother it was a hard one the hardest one because i was not preparing to support such a situation
in the family you have one who you love one who you care about above all the rest and i think ibrahim was this guy
when he passed away
that time was quite difficult because we have the beginning of this season in the premier league and to manage that was difficult
amid the tragedy toure and sibling <unk> who plays for liverpool opted to stay in brazil and represent their country
it's a decision that he still regrets to this day
playing the ensuing game against greece he admits in my mind i was thinking that after the game i was calling him ibrahim
i was still asking how do you feel about the game i played against greece
but he passed away before the game
perhaps the memory is in some ways just as raw now with the brothers back in international action for their country for the upcoming africa cup of nations in equatorial guinea
at this time the <unk> of all african players are tested given so many play for top european club which are often fighting for titles and cups
it's difficult because your country and club is always our hardest divide especially the city fans the chairman the boss as well they're good with me and i want to give one hundred percents when i'm there said the thirty one year old
the elephants are undeniably one of the strongest teams in the continent of africa given they can call on the likes of the <unk> recent city signing wilfried bony <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
but the nation have not always shone at international level especially at africa's most prestigious tournament winning just one <unk> title back in one thousand nine hundred and ninety two and finishing runners up in two thousand and six and again two years ago
i think it's the lack of concentration or maybe it's because we fear our own team
we think we are the best but
you have to have desire you have to have determination says toure reflecting on his country's relative under performance at the tournament
we have to be mentally ready for the hard battle because in africa it's not only the opponent we have to fight
we have to fight the temperature as well we have to fight the field
the tournament had been due to take place in morocco but amid fears of the ebola crisis the north african nation withdrew as hosts and equatorial guinea stepped in as hosts
ebola remains a talking point among players and toure has no <unk> that it's something that concerns him ahead of an opening game against guinea where the disease has taken hold
it's difficult when you feel like your family can maybe contract this infection you're a little bit afraid he says
yes we fear but we can't say we don't want to go because it's a situation we need to educate people because people don't understand how to protect themselves against this infection
there was talk of perhaps <unk> the tournament for a year due to the threat posed by ebola but toure believes organizers are right to go ahead
january is the time when the african people can enjoy he says
the african player coming from europe is like a moment in a dream for the african because when they see us coming they are always happy
it's going to be like a big <unk> where people can enjoy they can dance they can love and they can do what they want
after <unk> tumultuous two thousand and fourteen he's hopeful it will prove the perfect start to two thousand and fifteen
so reads the statement issued by saudi arabia where i grew up the day the offices of charlie hebdo came under attack with the loss of twelve lives
last sunday to show further solidarity with the victims the saudi ambassador to france joined other world leaders in paris for a unity rally to celebrate free speech
this is consistent with the face saudi arabia presents to the outside world
visitors to the website of the saudi embassy in washington are invited to learn
how the kingdom's political system is rooted in islam's traditions which call for peace justice equality consultation and respect for the rights of the individual
just two days before the paris rally my friend raif badawi was removed in shackles from a mini bus outside the al <unk> mosque in jeddah as a large crowd gathered around him after friday prayers
according to eyewitnesses he closed his eyes and raised his head <unk> as a security officer approached him from behind with a large cane and started to beat him
witnesses say raif was lashed fifty times
afterwards he was taken back to prison where he is serving a ten year <unk> blogging
<unk> next flogging was set to take place today but saudi authorities postponed it due to medical advice his wife said
she expects he will be flogged again next <unk> every following <unk> his sentence of one thousand lashes is complete
raif is officially charged with adopting liberal thought founding a liberal website and insulting islam
he has become the latest symbol of the two faced policy his country takes towards human rights
saudi arabia is a strong american ally that has enjoyed virtually unconditional support from the united states for decades
president bush famously held hands with its monarch king abdullah as the two <unk> through his crawford texas <unk> during the king's two thousand and five state visit
president obama was widely criticized for appearing to bow to abdullah at a g twenty summit in london
in the same month that isis horrified the world with its brutal beheading of journalist james foley saudi arabia publicly beheaded nineteen people for crimes ranging from smuggling cannabis to <unk>
limb <unk> for theft are sanctioned by the state religion
in addition to oil saudi arabia is the world's leading exporter of salafism an ultra conservative strain of islam
the country touts itself as the birthplace of the religion of <unk> underlines the islamic declaration of <unk> on its flag with a sword
osama bin laden was a saudi citizen as were fifteen of the nineteen hijackers on nine eleven
why does a world outraged by the horrific actions of isis and the taliban turn a blind eye to the way this country treats its own citizens
the first reason is obvious
it isn't just our governments
every time we fill our cars with gas we all bow to the saudi king
the second is more complex
online videos of <unk> flogging show <unk> from the mosque including young children running <unk> towards the square to watch the beating
afterwards the crowd <unk> into cheers and applause chanting allahu akbar
in unison
this isn't surprising
the public likely considers raif guilty of blasphemy and <unk>
a two thousand and thirteen pew research poll found that large numbers in muslim countries favor the death penalty for leaving <unk> eighty eight percents of egyptian and sixty two percents of pakistani muslims as well as majorities in jordan malaysia palestine and afghanistan
of course these views don't represent all muslims
but contrary to what we're usually told they aren't just held by a fringe minority either
many of these countries don't have populations willing to rally en <unk> to support free speech and <unk> the way france did
the change has to first come from within
raif has sacrificed a great deal to make this change happen
the world must support him and call saudi arabia out on its hypocrisy
some time ago just fifty miles east of where raif is being held today another dissident once spoke of change of challenging the status quo of radical new ideas that would ultimately transform his society
he was <unk> <unk> and eventually driven from his city by those wanting to kill him
he was mohammed the prophet of islam
his <unk> the <unk> tribe of mecca
muslims endeavor to emulate the life of mohammed
saudi arabia has instead chosen to emulate the <unk>
this week raif spent his thirty one st birthday imprisoned and wounded
with enough awareness we can put enough international pressure on the saudi government to ensure that he spends his next one with his wife and their three beautiful children

there's the two million dollar he's splashed out on michael jackson memorabilia and then there's the financial dealings he's had with italian businessman <unk> berardi
that's a deal that has come at some cost to berardi who as you read this is in a jail cell measuring three meters by three meters
the italian businessman is incarcerated in <unk> equatorial guinea a country of just seven hundred and eighty thousand inhabitants known for its extremes of wealth and poverty
it may be the third largest oil producer in sub saharan africa and have a gdp to rival many a western nation but more than three quarters of <unk> live in poverty says the world bank
later this week a country human rights groups describe as a repressive dictatorship and one of the world's most repressive societies will host africa's most important sporting event the cup of nations football tournament
the fifty year old berardi who has three children and a wife waiting for him back home in europe was convicted in two thousand and thirteen of <unk> fraud and <unk>
his family says he was tortured during his detention according to human rights watch and has always maintained his innocence
the equatorial guinea government did not respond to cnn's request by phone or email for comment on the allegation berardi was tortured
the founder of <unk> <unk> does say he made one mistake
having entered into business with <unk> obiang <unk> <unk> nicknamed teodorin the son of equatorial guinea's president berardi had the <unk> to question his partner about <unk> payments going to an unnamed account in the u.s
in response teodorin the second vice president of a country critics allege is run as a family business and who has a passion for jackson memorabilia accused berardi himself of financial <unk>
at his brief trial <unk> family says no evidence was presented to support the charges brought against him
teodorin himself is no stranger to allegations of financial fraud
in october the u.s. justice department stated that teodorin had <unk> his homeland through relentless embezzlement and extortion
berardi has been in custody since january two thousand and thirteen is often denied access to his lawyer according to the geneva based world organisation against torture and has spent the last year in isolation after being sentenced in august two thousand and thirteen to two years and four months
his family hopes berardi who has lost thirty forty kilograms and suffered typhoid and malaria in prison according to human rights watch could be released later this year though the date remains uncertain
we don't believe he will be able to come out of prison in may <unk> brother <unk> told cnn
we are very worried because no one is telling us what is going on and we know that the equatorial guinea government is repressive
berardi is the personal prisoner of his business associate teodorin added <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> legal representative in equatorial guinea
but as his lawyer i am sure he will be freed in may
the equatorial guinea government did not respond to cnn's request by phone and email for comment on the suggestion berardi was <unk> personal prisoner
either way <unk> is a tale which highlights the manner in which the country <unk> between cameroon and <unk> on the gulf of guinea goes about its business
president obiang now seventy two is one of the world's longest serving leaders having been in power since one thousand nine hundred and seventy nine when he <unk> his uncle in a coup
despite a per capita gdp in excess of twenty two thousand dollar equatorial guinea's many critics accuse the government of <unk> off its huge wealth for their personal gain
the people certainly see little benefit with the united nations saying that more than half the population lack access to both clean water and basic sanitation facilities
the way some diplomats describe equatorial guinea is that the country is in effect a family business said javier blas the africa editor for britain's financial times newspaper
the president's family controls all political power and the economy
teodorin the eldest son of the president controls the most powerful corners of the intelligence service and the presidential guard
the youngest son gabriel is the minister of oil so in effect it's a family business and it's managed like a family business without space for anyone else
it's a dictatorship
over the last year teodorin has been pictured in equatorial guinea and at the world cup in brazil with christina <unk> a <unk> who was crowned bride of the world in two thousand and twelve
he has a playboy reputation is known and criticized for his lavish lifestyle
in the past he has owned a fleet of cars <unk> ferraris rolls <unk> and <unk> a thirty eight dollar <unk> m <unk> jet a one hundred and eighty dollar m mansion in paris and a thirty dollar m malibu california home with golf course
he no longer possesses the california estate
he gave up his home as part of a settlement in u.s. district court in los angeles in a case called united states v. one white crystal covered bad tour glove
and not just any glove but one used by the late singer jackson part of nearly two dollar m worth of the dead <unk> memorabilia acquired by teodorin
the american government alleged that teodorin used money <unk> from his homeland to <unk> substantial assets in the u.s. including the jackson memorabilia and last october a settlement was reached whereby he was forced to hand over thirty dollar m
through relentless embezzlement and extortion vice president obiang <unk> looted his government and shook down businesses in his country to support his lavish lifestyle while many of his fellow citizens lived in extreme poverty said <unk> caldwell assistant attorney general for the justice department's criminal division
after <unk> in millions in bribes and <unk> obiang embarked on a corruption fueled spending spree in the u.s. she stated in october
for his part teodorin insists he did nothing wrong and he was using his own money to purchase the malibu mansion
speaking to cnn in two thousand and twelve his father had defended <unk> lifestyle saying his son a potential successor amassed his wealth through successful business ventures prior to assuming any <unk> position
despite human rights watch describing equatorial guinea as being plagued by corruption poverty and <unk> not to mention the charges leveled against teodorin the u.s. government enjoys decent relations with equatorial guinea
u.s. president barack obama and president <unk> obiang <unk> <unk> have even been pictured together at the white house
equatorial guinea is one of the biggest oil <unk> in africa and the u.s. is the country's main trading partner
yet prior to the discovery of oil and gas in the mid nineties equatorial guinea was incredibly poor
overnight its fortunes changed even if those of its people didn't
a vast majority of the population is believed to live on less than two dollars a day
asked about that statistic by cnn's christiane amanpour in two thousand and twelve president obiang said
that's completely fabricated
he also said his country is prosecuting anyone involved in corruption
those who criticize us are <unk> their judgment on outdated information and certainly haven't visited equatorial guinea for themselves to find out about all the good things that are there
more than three quarters of the country lives at or below the national poverty line according to world bank figures from two thousand and six and the u.n. considers the country as one of least developed nations in the world according to two thousand and nine numbers
we can not use money from the natural resources as a christmas gift to the people
the government builds public housing hospitals schools roads and airports to transform the country
it is promoting national businesses in order to avoid <unk> by foreign companies
having traveled to the country last year the financial times blas disputes some of these claims but says there are signs of development as well
it's a country of <unk>
you have a new highway linking <unk> to a new residential area built for the african union summit of recent years and it's empty you could drive for twenty minutes and you would see no cars said blas
then you go elsewhere and the roads are narrow with <unk> everywhere
their excuse is they are spending the money but on hotels conventions centers and highways for visiting dignitaries
it's for show
that is also the reason they are hosting the nations cup
it's like window shopping they are putting up a nice front window but when you go inside the shop the reality is really different
human rights groups say press freedom is limited in equatorial guinea something that blas says he knows first hand
visa and press <unk> in hand blas says he was met at the airport last year by one of the minister of <unk> deputies
but the <unk> laptop and notebooks were all later taken
we were detained for six hours in the national security <unk> said the <unk> journalist
they told us that the only way they would allow us to leave the country was if i gave the password to my computer which i did since it had no confidential info
despite its dismal record on battling corruption the confederation of african football turned to equatorial guinea in november after morocco chose against hosting the nations cup just two months ahead of the tournament citing fears of the ebola epidemic
having co hosted the nations cup in two thousand and twelve equatorial guinea had some facilities in place and its wealth meant it could handle the challenge at such short notice
three years ago the hosts then as now the lowest ranked side in the competition reached the quarterfinals and the squad shared a million dollars after winning their first game
the money was a gift from teodorin then the country's agriculture minister
and he has in essence given money to his country's poor in another way
two thirds of the thirty dollar m in assets he surrendered to the u.s. government went to a charity working in equatorial guinea
meaning some of the oil wealth may finally trickle down to those <unk> most in need
according to a recent study shipping accounts for around three percents of global co two emissions
not surprising when you consider that the engines of the world's estimated ninety thousand cargo ships are in use twenty four hours a day while traveling
futuristic concepts for container ships powered by alternative energy range from <unk> powered propellers to banks of vertical metal sails
even though most are still on the drawing board one concept is starting to be viewed seriously by the shipping industry
called the vindskip the norwegian design uses the high sides of its container ships as sails turning the whole vessel into a wind assisted <unk>
designed by lade as the oslo based company says the hybrid merchant ship which would still have a liquefied natural gas powered engine could achieve fuel savings of sixty percents and reduce emissions by eighty percents
it's the brainchild of <unk> lade who used his skills as a speed sailor to develop his aerodynamic design
he says the futuristic container ship works more like an airplane than a conventional sailing ship
he said
in the era of christopher columbus for example he would have used what became known as trade winds but his ship was quite different from the vindskip because he would have been sailing with the wind he couldn't sail into the wind
vindskip can almost sail into the wind
in this way it's more like an airplane
it uses apparent wind or the sail wind to generate pull in much the same way that an airplane will take off when it reaches a certain speed
the ship would be able to point as high as eighteen degrees into the wind the vacuum created on the lee side of the vessel enough to propel the ship forward
critical to the design is computer software being developed by germany's <unk> center for maritime logistics and services which calculates the optimal sailing route based on the weather and prevailing winds
with this software you input when you want to leave and when you want to arrive the weather forecast is loaded into the program and then it calculates the best route lade said
this would be <unk> updated every day
at each <unk> it would check with the time arrival and tell the crew whether to speed up using the engines or slow down
it makes it very easy for the crew
the algorithms in the software also calculate the best angle to the wind to gain the maximum performance from the design
with our weather <unk> module the best route can be calculated in order to consume as little fuel as possible
as a result costs are reduced
after all bunker expenses account for the largest part of the total costs in the shipping industry said laura <unk> researcher at <unk> in hamburg
changes to regulations in the sulfur content of marine heavy fuels are set to make the price of bunker fuel typically among the heaviest and <unk> of fuels in the <unk> process more expensive
<unk> traditionally favored polluting residual bunker fuels because they were cheap with large ships having the space to transport the pre <unk> necessary to make the fuel volatile
but all that is about to change
current international regulations cap sulfur content at three point five percents but this is expected to drop to zero point five percents by two thousand and twenty
this makes things quite dramatic said lade
there are not many good solutions to this
at the moment they can wash the exhaust with <unk> but on big ships this is very complex and very expensive
this is where the vindskip comes in due to the low fuel consumption it can run on lng which means there is no sulfur at all
one of norway's biggest <unk> <unk> has already entered the project on a technical basis and while lade is quietly confident the world's first vindskip will slip into the water by two thousand and nineteen he says the global shipping industry had been slow to respond to his design
the big driving force in the vindskip project will be these new regulations on sulfur levels lade said
the big problem with sulfur is that it <unk> the sea and this means that <unk> and crabs can't form their shells said lade adding that <unk> was impacting the entire marine ecosystem
it's very bad
something has to be done it can't go on this way
the danish shipping line maersk told cnn that it was pursuing innovations in energy efficiency as a solution in the here and now
in general we do not believe that wind assisted designs will play any significant role within the container shipping industry in the foreseeable future said maersk head of sustainability <unk> <unk> jensen
the technology remains unproven at both commercial and operational scale
she said that maersk was developing its triple e vessels which used ultra long stroke engines efficient vessel shape and advanced waste heat recovery systems to improve co two efficiency by fifty percents per container
if you look at the technology already on board our vessels today it's remarkable just how far we've come she said

in south africa the journey for many plums starts in the picturesque <unk> valley in the western cape where the climate is well suited for growing the stone fruit
we've got a slightly cooler summer than the rest of the area explains jan hoon marketing manager at <unk> fruit packers
plums prefer cooler temperatures during the growing area of the plum from after <unk> until harvesting
so the time of the fruit on the tree is more compared to other areas
and it is plums that are the most important stone fruit to the south african economy making up a bigger share of both production and exports than <unk> and <unk>
according to <unk> experts <unk> almost sixteen million <unk> of stone fruit were exported during the two thousand and thirteen fourteen season of which ten point five million <unk> were plums
hoon and his team are focused on getting the stone fruit out of the <unk> into the pack shed and off to market largely in europe and the middle east
in fact approximately seventy percents of plums grown in south africa are destined to be sold overseas
they must be shipped for four weeks explains technical and quality assistant <unk> <unk>
by the time they reach the market they must be completely edible and sweet
fortune plums are a red variety with yellow flesh but hoon and <unk> must pack the stone fruit before they are fully ripe and colored
if you don't pick it at the right maturity then it doesn't get overseas at the right eating quality explains fruit farmer <unk> <unk>
we do check pressures to see that the maturity is right he continues
as soon as we do that it will go into the cold room for a day to cool it down after we pick it
then we take it out and pack it and we ship it
according to the national agricultural marketing council plum production in south africa has increased from sixty thousand tons in two thousand and nine two thousand and ten to nearly eighty thousand tons in two thousand and thirteen two thousand and fourteen
and <unk> is expecting plum shipments to increase by around ten percents this year
but to ensure these forecasts are met farmers like <unk> need the right climatic conditions
weather is quite a big factor for the plum industry <unk> explains
if it rains then we don't have fruit on the trees or very little and if the weather is too dry or too hot then we've got smaller fruit
this year we are seven to ten days earlier than last year so the fruit is much smaller than the previous year
in order to export fruit certain criteria need to be met
essential for plum producers is the global gap food safety certification which gives shop customers and retailers in one hundred and eighteen countries the ability to trace a product right back to the farm
fruit producers must also comply with standards set by the sustainability initiative of south africa which was established by the south african fruit industry to make sure labor practices in <unk> and pack <unk> are ethical
they've got eight minimum steps
forced labor child labor hours working of the laborers explains <unk>
all that stuff needs to be in place on the farm and that's quite a lot of paperwork that needs to be done
but for a company focused on selling abroad the challenges don't stop with paperwork
as the african market for stone fruit grows by one hundred per cent year on year the <unk> and producers need to adapt to the market
the infrastructure in africa is very limited at the moment says hoon
not a lot of cold <unk> around in africa
there are only a certain amount of plum varieties we are capable of exporting into africa but definitely africa is a growing market
but hoon is also clear that the current established markets will continue to be important for the south african stone fruit industry
our advantage is that we are almost ten days quicker on transit time from south africa into the european markets so in general in the stone fruit season in we produce about sixty seventy percents of the out of season stone fruit production for europe he explains
we need to be better than our competition which is mainly south america so we just need to <unk> them and deliver better quality for the markets

it is a human right if you were born a male or female and you want to have a sex change or lead a life of a different gender said <unk> <unk> the spokesperson of constitution drafting committee which is working on a new draft of the country's constitution
people should have that freedom to change sex and they should be equally protected by the constitution and the law and treated fairly
third gender means that an individual does not have to identify as either male or female and gives their right to self identify
if enacted thailand would join several asian countries including india pakistan and nepal that have recently moved to recognize third gender
this week the constitution drafting committee a panel tapped by the current thai military <unk> started work on a new draft
the <unk> which calls itself the national council for peace and order took power in may after a military coup
the old constitution recognizes people of different religion age gender but had not extended to transgender people
it is now time to recognize the existence of the third gender in thai society said <unk>
so we expand the region of protection as well
hopefully introducing third gender will help reduce discrimination in society
the constitution drafting committee is expected to consider various components of thai law and submit it to review by april
the decision to legalize the constitution will be made on august six
there's a perception that transgender people are well accepted in thailand due to the availability of gender reassignment surgery
but challenges still exist several transgender people living in bangkok told cnn
first of all in thailand we're pretty well accepted we can walk in the street and we don't have to fear that someone's going to shoot you in the head
at the same time the most difficult thing is at a professional level that people don't accept people like us said <unk> <unk> a <unk>
it's difficult for transgender people despite their education level to get hired and accepted by companies she added
and matters like which locker room or bathroom to use become a human resources issue
and there is no legal <unk> when discrimination occurs because there have been no laws to protect them said <unk> <unk> a transgender activist with the thai transgender alliance in bangkok
another problem is that the gender marked on government documents doesn't match how individuals identify their gender
when <unk> travels she gets pulled out of immigration lines for questioning by officials because of the gender marked on her passport
for trans people we can not change our title name
i'm still a <unk> in my country
i can not change my title
my name is mr. <unk> said <unk> a transgender woman
while recognizing the third gender would not resolve all the challenges it would be history for our advocacy work she added
earlier last year india's supreme court granted the country's <unk> and transgender individuals the right to self identify their gender
asian countries including nepal pakistan and bangladesh have implemented policies recognizing third gender in recent years
australia started allowing a third gender option in passports in two thousand and eleven
according to a two thousand and twelve report by the global commission on hiv and the law twenty countries have passed progressive legislation on the issue including argentina uruguay and portugal
even as transgender people are no longer forced to conform to specific <unk> in certain countries they are still denied acceptance in many societies
same sex marriage remains illegal in countries like pakistan sri lanka bangladesh and <unk>
and thailand does not have plans to legalize same sex marriages in its constitution said <unk>

the current level of security in belgium will remain for at least one month and will then be evaluated to determine if it needs to be modified the country's prime minister said late friday

in one corner <unk> frenchman david ginola his carefully <unk> hair and <unk> tones a <unk> <unk> to the man in the other current incumbent and <unk> <unk> sepp blatter
the former player's <unk> presence would undoubtedly light up the conference rooms and corridors of power in the shiny bunker that serves as the headquarters of world football's governing body in switzerland
david ginola is a great candidate for the fifa presidency who will hopefully give all football lovers a real champion to get behind a member of ginola's campaign team told cnn
and while many might dismiss the forty seven year old's bid to become soccer's most powerful individual as a <unk> ginola has some heavyweight backing in the form of a bookmaker and one of the <unk> biggest public relations firms
the ordinary football fan on the street would no doubt rank ginola more popular than his rival by virtue of a distinguished and <unk> seventeen year playing career that saw him star for the likes of french outfit paris saint german and tottenham in england
but even though blatter's seventeen year reign has been <unk> in its latter years at least by scandal and criticism the swiss appears a vice like grip on the presidency
so why is ginola putting his head above the <unk> and can he really oust a seventy eight year old who enjoys overwhelming support from the majority of fifa's two hundred and nine members
ginola embodied the newly discovered <unk> of the english game when he signed for kevin <unk> newcastle united in one thousand nine hundred and ninety five
the premier league was in its infancy with glamorous foreign players pouring into the competition and the <unk> <unk> skills good looks and flowing locks made an instant impact
though he had <unk> a <unk> one title and two french cup triumphs with paris saint <unk> he arrived in the north east of england under something of a cloud
ginola's failure to keep possession at the end of a crucial qualifier with bulgaria led to a late equalizer that meant france failed to qualify for the one thousand nine hundred and ninety four world in the united states
national team coach gerard <unk> said ginola had sent an <unk> missile through the heart of french football and for a time afterwards he was <unk> by supporters
but if the public were skeptical about him in france fans of the english game took to him immediately
he made an instant impact for <unk> team dubbed the <unk> due to their <unk> style scoring a <unk> of sensational goals
ginola was seen as one of <unk> most creative players and they raced into a lead at the top of the premier league in the one thousand nine hundred and ninety five ninety six season only to be overtaken by manchester united after a late season stumble in form
another second place finish was secured the following season but <unk> had resigned half way through the campaign to be replaced by kenny <unk> and ginola was sold to tottenham in july one thousand nine hundred and ninety seven
he was voted player of the year by his fellow professionals in one thousand nine hundred and ninety nine and won the only trophy of his spell in england the league cup england's second most prestigious cup competition
in that season ginola scored arguably his best goal a <unk> run and finish in an fa cup tie against <unk> one that perfectly <unk> the touch of genius his boots contained
spells at aston villa and <unk> followed as did <unk> that played on his charm and charisma
one for shampoo brand l'oreal included the line
i'm a footballer not a movie star in a commercial that treated him exactly like a hollywood heavyweight
who is backing the bid
ginola's tilt at football's top job is being funded by controversial bookmaker paddy power
the irish firm has attracted criticism in the past for its conduct offering odds in two thousand and ten on which animal would be driven to extinction first by the oil spill disaster in the gulf of mexico
it has also got into hot water with its <unk> approach to advertising
in two thousand and ten a television ad that showed blind footballers mistakenly kicking a cat instead of the ball was the most complained about that year in the uk
at the two thousand and twelve world cup they agreed to pay an eighty thousand euros fine handed to <unk> <unk> by uefa after the danish footballer celebrated a goal by pulling down his shorts to reveal paddy power branded underwear
and an ad pledging money back if he walks relating to the trial of <unk> south african <unk> oscar pistorius received over five thousand complaints and a <unk> from the uk's advertising <unk> for bringing the industry into <unk>
they also sponsored a series of visits to north korea by former nba star dennis <unk> though they withdrew their support after the last trip at the end of two thousand and thirteen
but the firm has for the last two years backed the rainbow <unk> campaign alongside gay rights charity <unk> to try and change attitudes towards homosexuality in football
as well as paddy power helping manage ginola's candidacy is <unk> <unk> pr which counts some of the world's most powerful brands among their clients
but they will have their work cut out if they are to spread ginola's message wide enough to have a real impact on the vote
ginola retired from football in two thousand and two and has since worked as a <unk> on french and uk television
he has also been involved with the charitable arm at his old club the tottenham hotspur foundation and was an ambassador for england's doomed two thousand and eighteen world cup bid
his team are confident he is eligible to run for fifa's presidency as the rules state a contender has to have played an active role in association football for two of the five years <unk> his proposed <unk>
however ginola also needs support from at least five member associations within fifa to ensure he can run against blatter who faces competition from another independent frenchman jerome champagne and jordan's prince ali who announced his intention to run last week
blatter's stranglehold on fifa was underlined when the asian football confederation confirmed its intention to support him instead of prince ali who is its vice president
blatter had repeatedly said his current term as president would be his last but had a rethink at the fifa congress in june last year this despite the increasingly turbulent nature of his tenure
the swiss has had to fend off allegations of corruption relating to the bidding process for the two thousand and eighteen world cup awarded to russia and the two thousand and twenty two <unk> given to qatar
he enlisted u.s. lawyer michael garcia to probe claims that <unk> former fifa member mohamed bin hammam used a multi million dollar <unk> fund to buy support for the bid charges the qatar bid have strenuously denied
garcia quit his role as chairman of the investigatory chamber of the fifa ethics committee after <unk> to the way his report into the bidding process had been <unk> by german judge hans <unk> eckert the <unk> independent ethics <unk>
bin hammam was the only challenger to the president four years ago but withdrew from the race after he was suspended on bribery charges leaving blatter to run <unk> amid <unk> scenes at the congress in zurich
the head of european soccer's governing body michel platini has called on blatter to stand down but announced he wouldn't be running for president
it remains to be seen whether ginola or any of his fellow candidates can make a significant dent in the support blatter holds among fifa's members and make the may elections anything more than another <unk> conclusion
chinese state media reported this week that veterinarians are using antiviral therapy to treat five year old feng feng after medical tests showed serious damage to the <unk> heart liver kidney and lungs
two other pandas <unk> and <unk> have passed away from the <unk> <unk> virus since early december according to han <unk> spokesperson at the <unk> province rare wildlife rescue and breeding research center
the virus is often fatal for pandas killing up to eighty percents of those infected
the research center says it does not know how the infections occurred
the <unk> face an uphill battle against the virus since there often aren't adequate tools available when it comes to treating and preventing panda diseases
it's hard on giant pandas because no companies or research institutions at home produce vaccines that are specially designed for giant pandas
in other words we can hardly find a vaccine that can give effective protection <unk> <unk> associate professor of veterinary medicine at china agriculture university told cctv china's state broadcaster
the <unk> center said it's doing what it can to prevent the disease from spreading
chinese state media reported that panda breeding centers in neighboring sichuan province have <unk> emergency measures including enhanced disinfection of panda <unk> and limits on public contact
china has devoted considerable resources to saving the giant panda an endangered species that is considered a national treasure
scientists have made headway in recent years getting the pandas to breed in captivity and a serious disease outbreak could undermine those efforts
the executions were announced thursday by indonesia's recently appointed attorney general <unk> <unk> who said in a statement that preparations for the executions were almost complete
he said the executions had been scheduled after petitions for clemency to indonesian president joko widodo were rejected late last month
widodo had previously told a university audience he planned to reject the sixty four appeals for clemency he had received from drug offenders on death row
the four men and two women to be executed hailed from brazil malawi nigeria the netherlands vietnam and indonesia said <unk>
among them is brazilian marco archer <unk> moreira fifty three who would be the first of his countrymen ever to be legally executed abroad said leonardo <unk> counselor at the embassy of brazil in jakarta
the embassy of brazil is doing its best to try to postpone the execution he told cnn saying it was scheduled for this weekend
we are trying everything we can through the proper channels
brazil does not have the death penalty on its books he said
the condemned man had been in jail since two thousand and three after having been caught at jakarta airport with thirteen kilograms of cocaine he said
sentenced to death in two thousand and four he lodged a petition for clemency in two thousand and ten according to a statement from the attorney general's office
the government of the netherlands is also protesting the planned execution of indonesian born dutch citizen ang <unk> <unk> who was condemned to death in two thousand and three for drug trafficking
the netherlands <unk> condemns the planned execution <unk> <unk> spokesman for the foreign affairs ministry of the netherlands told cnn adding that his government was making every effort to the highest level to prevent it
also sentenced to death and facing likely execution this year are the two australian <unk> of the so called bali nine ring arrested in two thousand and five with more than eight kg of heroin
human rights groups have slammed the executions calling for them to be stopped
tackling rising crime rates is a legitimate goal of president <unk> administration but the death penalty is not the answer and does not work as a deterrent to crime said rupert abbott amnesty international's research director for southeast asia and the pacific
<unk> <unk> deputy director of human rights watch's asia division accused indonesia of double standards in lobbying to prevent the execution of its nationals overseas but refusing requests by the brazilian government to extradite moreira to serve out his sentence in his home country
indonesia which has extremely strict drug laws carries out executions by firing squad
the country resumed executions in two thousand and thirteen after a four year break but no executions were carried out in two thousand and fourteen
the people arrested are suspected of providing logistical support for the attacks
the arrests were made in the grigny and <unk> <unk> neighborhoods and those arrested were in amedy coulibaly's entourage the paris prosecutor's representative said
coulibaly was killed last friday in a police siege to end a hostage taking at a kosher supermarket in paris
he had killed four hostages and is believed to have shot a policewoman to death in the city a day earlier
two days before coulibaly was killed brothers said and cherif kouachi had attacked the offices of satirical magazine charlie hebdo killing twelve people and injuring eleven
they died the same day as coulibaly as police moved in to end a separate siege
there does not appear to be a command and control element to the paris attacks other than a general go forward and do something a western official with direct knowledge told cnn describing the attack as highly <unk> terrorism with general instructions
the kouachi brothers legitimately aligned with aqap and cherif kouachi was associated with networks that brought him to yemen to train with the terror group but coulibaly's alleged connection with isis is still unclear the official said
aqap refers to al qaeda in the arabian peninsula
investigators are still trying to determine whether coulibaly coordinated with the kouachi brothers in the execution of the attacks or launched his own attack after learning of their actions said the western official
who were the victims
france's frayed nerves will not be eased by the belgian authorities operation thursday to dismantle a suspected terror cell believed to be on the brink of carrying out attacks on police
however investigators have so far found no links with events in paris belgian prosecutor eric van der sypt said
meanwhile in the french city of reims about ninety miles northeast of paris the city hall confirmed friday that a police operation had taken place and that there had been gunfire
it's not clear whether this is related to the investigation of the paris attacks
however reims was the hometown of said kouachi
at the same time a man with a handgun entered a post office in colombes a northwestern suburb of paris according to the local police department
police said the man might be mentally unstable and that they did not know yet if this was terror related
according to french media there are up to five hostages inside the post office
in his first visit to france since last week's terror attacks u.s. secretary of state john kerry said that he really wanted to come here and share a hug with all of paris and all of france
standing alongside paris mayor anne <unk> kerry added that he wanted to express to you personally the sheer horror and <unk> over what he called a living nightmare
american singer james taylor also appeared <unk> a customized version of his one thousand nine hundred and seventy one hit song you've got a friend
kerry met earlier with president francois hollande when he voiced the full and heartfelt condolences of americans
we watched the people of france come together with a great sense of purpose and unity
it was a great lesson to the world that once again france's commitment to freedom and passion of ideas has made an important statement to the world kerry said
kerry laid a wreath at a makeshift memorial at the site of the kosher supermarket attack friday accompanied by foreign minister laurent fabius
kerry and fabius spoke there for several minutes with joel <unk> the president of <unk> du paris a national jewish organization
kerry and fabius also paid their respects at the offices of charlie hebdo
francois <unk> the mayor of paris eleven th district where the offices are located told cnn that kerry's visit was very welcome
it's so important for us to feel supported at this time he said
the street is still cordoned off as investigators continue to <unk> the area for clues adding to the sense of <unk> for local residents he said
we know that the threat is still very high and we don't know how long we will be able to withstand this threat he said
president barack obama's administration has admitted it erred by not sending a senior figure to a huge unity march held sunday in paris
more than forty world leaders including the british german and israeli heads of state and russia's foreign minister joined at least one point five million people on the french capital's streets
the <unk> continue after the attack on the charlie hebdo offices
funerals are being held for magazine editor stephane charb charbonnier illustrator philippe honore and algerian born copy editor <unk> ourrad
the question of where to bury their killers is more contentious
cherif kouachi's widow <unk> kouachi has requested that both he and his brother said kouachi be buried in gennevilliers on the outskirts of paris
the gennevilliers mayor's office told cnn that the city was <unk> by law to bury cherif kouachi there as he was a resident of the city
but a spokesman for the mayor jean francois <unk> said that it would not do the same for said because he lived in reims
that's for sure he's not from gennevilliers we won't let him get a funeral here <unk> said
a survivors issue of charlie hebdo was published wednesday the first since the attack
copies have flown off the racks of newsstands despite a print run of more than four million
however the magazine's decision to run a cartoon of the prophet mohammed on the front cover not for the first time has been criticized by a number of muslim leaders since this is deeply offensive to many muslims
anger over the cartoon boiled over into violence friday in pakistan where police resorted to using tear gas and water <unk> to disperse protesters outside the french consulate in <unk>
a pakistani photographer for afp was shot and injured at the protest the french news agency reported
he is doing better it said via twitter
ahmed chinoy chief of <unk> citizen police liaison committee told cnn that investigations were underway to determine who shot the journalist
at least two hundred protesters were involved in the violence which broke out after religious parties called supporters out to condemn the cartoon following afternoon prayers chinoy said
the protests come a day after pakistan's parliament unanimously passed a resolution condemning the caricatures printed in charlie hebdo
several french media outlets websites went down friday morning including those of radio station france inter newspapers le parisien and twenty minutes weekly magazines l'express and <unk> and investigative publication <unk>
this prompted speculation that the outage could be the result of a hack linked to publication of the charlie hebdo cover
but internet service provider <unk> said it was not the result of a cyberattack
with france on its highest level of alert ten thousand troops have deployed across the country
thousands of police officers are on patrol including hundreds assigned to protect jewish schools
as france still reels from the shock of the paris attacks authorities in neighboring belgium <unk> in on an alleged terror cell in an operation that left two suspects dead
prosecutor van der sypt said weapons and police uniforms were recovered as part of raids on a dozen properties in belgium in which thirteen people were arrested
the plan was to kill police officers on public roads or in police offices he said
two people were also arrested in france he said and belgium will be asking for them to be extradited
they are belgian nationals who belong to the alleged cell but were found in france he said
a western intelligence source told cnn that the ongoing terror threat appears to involve up to twenty sleeper cells of between one hundred and twenty and one hundred and eighty people ready to strike in france germany belgium and the netherlands
al qaeda in the arabian peninsula claimed responsibility wednesday for the charlie hebdo shooting
the attack was years in the making aqap commander nasr ibn ali al ansi said in a video claiming u.s. born cleric anwar al awlaki was the mastermind behind it
in the days since last week's attacks security services have been working to track those associated with the kouachi brothers and coulibaly
neetin karasular a suspected belgian <unk> in weapons who met coulibaly's widow hayat boumeddiene is in custody karasular's attorney michel bouchat told cnn on friday
karasular has been charged with association with <unk> and offenses relating to firearms in a case handled by the local public prosecutor's office in charleroi belgium
according to bouchat police didn't find any weapons at karasular's house
however the police investigation revealed that karasular used to spend time in a garage in charleroi where documents were found that mentioned weapons
according to multiple belgian media accounts these included documents about the type of gun used by coulibaly in the attack on the supermarket a week ago
bouchat told cnn that his client was not at all connected to thursday's police raids in belgium
according to the attorney karasular wasn't involved in any jihadi group
bouchat confirmed that karasular had previous convictions
how the kouachi brothers were radicalized
the two suspects who died in the shootout are believed to have fought with isis in syria the source said
another man was captured but hasn't revealed any information
there also was a dire warning
not all the terrorists in the cell have been rounded up according to the source
belgian police have taken out part of the terror network plotting an attack in belgium but they have not yet taken down every component of it the source said
there is fear others may try to avenge the two men
authorities investigating the aftermath of the raid in which the men were killed found materials used to make bombs including chemicals for the powerful explosive <unk> but the suspected terrorists had yet to assemble those weapons
they also had grenades
cell members had discussed attacking police in <unk> phone conversations but belgian investigators still did not know what they were intending to target for sure the source said
the discovery of police uniforms after the raid suggested the possibility they may have been trying to gain access to sensitive sites
the source characterized the cell as one with organized structures a logistical support network and links back to syria and iraq
belgium is one of the nations participating in airstrikes in iraq and officials are concerned this plot is isis pivoting to launch attacks on the european countries involved in the military action against their troops in iraq
i think one of the things that's happening is we're seeing something that's surprising me
that is the pivot of isis philip <unk>
a former cia counterterrorism official and a cnn analyst said
just last summer we were talking about how quickly isis was taking over geography
for a terrorist group to turn around in six or eight months and start training people for operations in europe is remarkable
in the raid in verviers a city of about fifty six thousand people police approached three suspects as they carried large <unk> bags outside of a former bakery that might have been their <unk> a western intelligence source told cnn
the suspects immediately opened fire with multiple weapons prosecutors spokesman thierry werts said
police returned fire
two gunmen were killed and another was arrested federal prosecutor eric van der sypt said
that raid turned up four kalashnikovs handguns bomb making materials and police uniforms van der sypt said
van der sypt refused to name the two killed in verviers but said we have a pretty good idea who they were
answering reporters questions the prosecutor would not comment on reported plans by the suspects to <unk> or behead any victims
the belgian counterterrorism source said belgian authorities had asked the cia for help in finding the director of the plot a belgian who was in greece
neither the cia nor greek officials were able to locate the man
he is described as a key link to isis in syria for the terror cell and once fought there
the two men killed in the shootout were among more than a dozen people rounded up in across the country raids designed to stop a group's allegedly imminent attack a plot to kill belgian police in streets and stations van der sypt said earlier friday
the alleged <unk> including the two people killed thursday night in a battle with police in verviers were confronted in twelve raids across belgium from thursday into friday sypt said
could have been hours certainly no more than a day or two before terror attacks were to begin throughout belgium van der sypt told reporters of the alleged plot
besides the two killed seventeen have been arrested in the investigation thirteen in the belgium raids and four others in france including two who were detained while trying to cross from france into italy van der <unk> office said
investigators haven't found any links between the alleged belgium plot and last week's islamist terror attacks that killed seventeen people in paris the prosecutor said
but the belgium raids come amid fears of ongoing terror threats in europe as many as twenty terror cells with one hundred and twenty to one hundred and eighty people may be ready to strike in france germany belgium and the netherlands a western intelligence source told cnn
thursday night's raids were a dramatic culmination in a chain of belgian police investigations into an alleged terror cell that included people who had fought in syria van der sypt said
the u.s. intelligence community knew for weeks of the plot in belgium and was sharing critical information with belgian authorities several u.s. officials told cnn
the officials wouldn't say precisely what they knew how much they knew and when they knew it
there is concern those details could signal other militants planning other potential attacks
one u.s. official told cnn's barbara starr the entire developing plot was being monitored and watched
the official said we were aware
we were tracking this and added there is a high probability other attacks were being planned before the plots were disrupted by the raids
a european security source told cnn that belgian authorities arrested two men returning from syria over the weekend and <unk> them then decided to act quickly
the united states was aware of the timing of the belgian moves u.s. officials said
verviers is a little off the beaten path in eastern belgium the last stop before open fields and forest
like many european towns it's densely built
people live close together
the whole city must have heard the explosions and the gunfight according to resident frederic hausman
i can hear it
everybody can hear it he said
in this little city everybody heard the sound
from his window he could see police firing assault rifles at a nearby house
hausman recorded the assault on the house and posted it on youtube
the two who were killed were of north african descent the western intelligence source said
verviers is home to many people with moroccan roots according to a study by the nearby university of <unk>
immigrants make up more than eleven percents of the population with the largest contingent from other european countries
<unk> are the next largest group
verviers is about sixty nine miles east southeast of brussels and two hundred miles northeast of paris
the raids came as authorities monitored people returning from syria said werts the prosecutors spokesman
police had arrested questioned and searched neetin karasular a belgian suspected arms dealer allegedly aligned with isis and suspected of providing weapons to amedy coulibaly the man who attacked a paris kosher supermarket
karasular knew coulibaly's wife hayat boumeddiene who is also a terror suspect in france
karasular's lawyer michel bouchat said his client was facing local firearms charges and had no connection with any jihadi groups or terror plans
in the process police turned up names that solidified their suspicions about known persons the western intelligence source said
last weekend they arrested two more men at the charleroi airport as they returned from syria squeezed them for information then decided to act quickly the source said
the investigation made it possible to determine that the group was about to carry out major terrorist attacks in belgium imminently belgian prosecutor spokesman werts said
authorities believed the suspects in thursday's gun battle had been providing documents and weapons to men returning from syria the intelligence source said
a senior belgian counterterrorism official told cnn that the alleged terror cell is believed to have received instructions from isis
belgium is putting one hundred and fifty troops on standby for deployment in light of the increase in the country's terror threat level belgian interior minister jan <unk> said friday
it has not been determined where they will be deployed he said
the threat level will stay at three for one month prime minister charles michel told cnn affiliate rtl
it is a way to mobilize all forces to raise security added
in france police also made at least twelve arrests friday in the probe of last week's slayings of seventeen people
additionally two people suspected of involvement with the alleged verviers suspects were detained while trying to cross from france into italy through the frejus tunnel a spokesman for belgium's federal prosecutor's office said friday
belgium is asking france to extradite those two said the spokesman who would not disclose the suspects names or nationalities
in neighboring germany police in at least two cities arrested men they accuse of supporting jihadis in syria
these suspects did not appear to be planning homegrown attacks german authorities said
the fear of terror was already high in western europe after the <unk> in france that followed multiple threats of attacks from isis the islamist group fighting to establish what it calls its islamic caliphate in iraq and syria and al qaeda in the arabian peninsula
aqap has claimed responsibility for the paris slayings
men claiming to be isis terrorists and speaking french promised new attacks in france belgium germany and switzerland in an online video found on thursday
isis has said it would lash out at european countries participating in <unk> in the middle east
more than three thousand europeans have left to fight in syria in recent years
authorities have long warned that those fighters could return and carry out attacks at home
british intelligence has also warned another islamist group in syria was planning mass casualty attacks against the west an apparent reference to the khorasan group
the belgian raids came against the background of a terror trial of dozens of men suspected of recruiting jihadists or trying to go to syria to fight
an antwerp court was to return verdict this week but postponed it due to the paris attacks
the american troops will be deployed starting in early spring on six to eight week missions in three countries turkey qatar and saudi arabia as part of the obama administration's plan to expand training for moderate syrian rebels
those groups are battling forces loyal to syrian president bashar al assad and extremist groups such as isis as well as others linked to al qaeda
the mission would be led by the military and complement a modest cia training program based on what was authorized by the white house more than a year ago
saudi arabia turkey and qatar have agreed to host training sites and we anticipate the program to train and <unk> the moderate syrian opposition will take approximately four hundred u.s. trainers with the caveat that this number could <unk> based on course load course requirements and other <unk> said cmdr
<unk> smith a pentagon spokeswoman
we also anticipate that the trainers will have <unk>
we expect to begin training in early spring
the trainers focused on syria will join up to three thousand american troops that were authorized by president barack obama last year to act as anti isis fighters in iraq which shares a border with syria
american involvement in the battle against isis has been more robust in iraq where the government has requested assistance
american planes have conducted numerous bombing missions in both countries
this new training program is meant to help moderate syrian fighters target isis
the moderate fighters are also at war against al assad whom the obama administration also wants to see defeated
but in her statement smith didn't mention al assad as a target of the u.s. training mission
the goal for the train and <unk> program is to build the capabilities of the moderate syrian fighters to defend the syrian people
stabilize areas under opposition control
promote the conditions for a negotiated settlement of the conflict in syria
and empower <unk> to go on the offensive against isil she said using the u.s. government term for isis
u.s. officials have said that vetting the rebels who take part in the program will play an important role to assure they do not share any dual <unk> to <unk> al nusra al qaeda's affiliate in syria or any other militant groups
rear adm. john kirby the pentagon press secretary has said training the vetted rebels could take eight to twelve months before they are ready to return to syria for the fight against isis
quality control specialist <unk> said forty eight percents of the several thousand inspections <unk> and tests it conducted in china last year failed to meet the requirements <unk> by some of its clients western food trading companies and retailers
there are horror stories obviously <unk> labasse <unk> vice president told cnn by phone
we find factories that just have no basic idea about hygiene standards
people that handle the food they have no gloves nothing
labasse said there was a host of reasons for the <unk>
in some cases laboratory tests found abnormal levels of pesticides antibiotics heavy metals bacteria or viruses that could put consumers at risk
other transgressions included <unk> packaging abnormal coloring and odors bruising and in the case of seafood adding water to make the fish appear to weigh more than it does
china has experienced a string of stomach churning food scandals in recent years
the most high profile recent case involved a u.s. owned meat factory operating in china that was accused of selling out of date and tainted meat to clients including mcdonald's starbucks kfc and pizza hut chains
we see awareness growing but we don't see on the ground a concrete improvement yet it will come labasse said
labasse said the extremely fragmented nature of china's food chain the country has five hundred thousand food production and processing companies seventy percents of which have fewer than ten employees made it very difficult for authorities to control and foreign buyers to understand
companies like mcdonald's or kfc are dealing with their suppliers at <unk> length
so they know well the people they communicate with on a daily basis but they don't know what's going on behind the scenes said labasse
the buyers are focusing their efforts on the people they signed a contract with but they should take the extra step and take control of the full supply chain and going as far as the third or fourth level of suppliers

the sales manager of a <unk> car dealership has apologized for the actions of employees caught on camera <unk> the delivery driver
the conversation in an office focused on whether the driver believed he had received a tip or should have made change for the order
we will <unk> like to apologize for the actions that led to this situation this embarrassing video gone viral on the internet was not released by any employee of <unk> auto sales gary batista sales manager for the business said in a statement provided to cnn
a <unk> page set up by a woman who saw the video had raised eleven thousand five hundred dollar for the driver by thursday night
the situation began saturday when palace pizza delivery guy <unk> tansey delivered forty two dollar worth of pizzas and drinks to the dealership
he was paid fifty dollar in two twenty dollar s and two five dollar s said palace pizza manager adam <unk>
when he returned from the delivery someone from the car dealership called <unk> asking for the driver to return with change roughly seven dollar and some coins
the video begins when tansey returns to the dealership with the money
upon handing over the change to a man seated behind a desk tansey can be heard saying it just doesn't make sense why you'd hand me a bill that you were just gon na have me drive back here to give you back anyway
the man says to tansey i gave you everything they gave me so we would get the correct change
the two go back and forth a few more times neither giving up his position
i'm not mad i just had to waste my resources coming back here tansey says as he starts to leave
the man says to tansey the manager apologized once for you do you want him to apologize again for you
tansey responds you got your seven dollar back so the world is right now
one female employee follows tansey out of the office saying to him out the door before i put my foot in your a which prompts her co workers to <unk> in laughter
that woman's employment has since been terminated according to <unk> statement
one of those involved was not an employee he said
the video ends after another man also using <unk> <unk> his colleague to get <unk> owner and manager on the phone
i want him fired he says
amanda rogers a former waitress was so moved after seeing <unk> video on <unk> she called the pizza shop to find out the driver's name so she could send him a check
for them to call him back over money he <unk> received anyway rogers said i decided to take it one step further
why not get the kid more than he deserves
she said
rogers set up the fundraising page for tansey
it's entitled get <unk> his tip money
many are leaving donations in seven dollar increments the amount tansey drove back to return to the dealership
one commenter wrote you are a good example of someone treating people the way you want to be treated
rogers who was a stranger to tansey and his wife before this all started said she hopes the response would prove that people are actually nice out there
the video seemingly shot by a stationary surveillance camera was initially posted on youtube with the headline <unk> pizza driver
it has since been made private and it's unclear who posted it though batista said in his statement the person is not an employee of <unk> auto sales and had no authorization to do so
batista said the owner and <unk> plan to offer tansey a cash donation though his statement doesn't specify how much or whether they've spoken to the driver
<unk> said the son of the owner of the dealership stopped by palace pizza on wednesday to offer an apology in person
<unk> said the response at palace pizza has also been overwhelming
it's been tough to make pizzas with all the calls we've taken he said
three passengers all chinese citizens have been rescued and the search operation continues an official from the search and rescue office of the jiangsu maritime administration told cnn
those rescued included an interpreter and the suppliers of some of the equipment on board
the boat which had twenty five people aboard was testing water in the <unk> channel china's xinhua state news agency said
among the twenty five on board were eight foreign nationals the china news service reported
rescuers said their efforts were hampered by strong currents and cold water xinhua said
as many as twenty three vessels were involved in search and rescue operations including a crane that is being used to lift the boat which turned over as it sank out of the water
rescuers believe that there are several people trapped in the boat's cabin
one of the rescued passengers identified as translator wang <unk> told xinhua that he tried to hold onto one of the japanese engineers but the current broke his grip
only the two of us were in the cockpit he said
we have just finished the host load test of the main engine of the boat when the vessel suddenly <unk> over
water immediately filled in
xinhua reported that the owner of the boat had not followed procedure for the water testing operation and had not filed a route
for the past few months he was very quiet and he wanted isolation because he was watching or doing something on social media
and that's why he was <unk> <unk> khan said in an exclusive interview with cnn's ac three hundred and sixty thursday
now mohammed <unk> khan nineteen is accused of trying to support isis
this week he pleaded not guilty to a federal charge of attempting to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization
outside the courtroom in chicago his mother told reporters she had a message for the terror group's leader
leave our children alone
they're <unk> the children's innocence <unk> khan told cnn's anderson cooper thursday
the children are <unk>
they're vulnerable
their thinking skills have not completely developed and these people are <unk> on that
isis an extremist islamist group has been fighting to take over a swath of territory in iraq and syria where it wants to establish a caliphate or islamic state
the group regularly uses social media to promote its goals posting videos of brutal violence and using hashtags for other stories in the news to <unk> its message
authorities arrested mohammed khan at o'hare international airport in october as he was about to embark on a flight to istanbul
in a letter he left behind for his parents he wrote that he was leaving the united states and on his way to join isis according to a criminal complaint
he invited them to join him in the islamic state but he warned them not to tell anyone about his travel plans
the letter shocked them his mother said
the things in those letters did not reflect the upbringing they got
those values they don't come from us
it was so out of sync
it was so out of place she said
thomas <unk> the <unk> attorney said the case was a sign of nothing but <unk>
there are thousands of kids doing this and i think that's part of the point what's causing them to do it
i don't believe in my client's case it's because he's a violent person and wants to go kill people <unk> said
i think he was a misguided young man who got manipulated by social media
during questioning at the airport mohammed khan told fbi agents that a person he met online had given him the phone number of a person to call once he arrived in istanbul federal authorities said in october
that person khan allegedly told the agents was to take him to isis territory
according to the complaint khan told authorities he was planning on being in some type of public service like a police force or providing humanitarian work or in a combat role
isis has successfully recruited large numbers of foreign fighters from across the globe including from the united states and western europe
turkey the complaint notes is a common transit point for foreign fighters from western countries who travel to join isis
if it weren't for the internet his mother now says he would never be in the situation he is in today
so what's her message for other parents
maybe the mistake we made was maybe we protected our children
we were trying to protect our culture or values
maybe that was a mistake <unk> khan said
i would tell them to expose their children more to what's going on in the world help them develop critical thinking skills to differentiate between the good and the bad guys
yet there was brush fire level rage on and off the internet see <unk> following thursday morning's announcement of this year's academy award nominations over the fact that selma the critically acclaimed drama about martin luther king jr.'s <unk> campaign for voting rights in the south received only two oscar nods one of them for best picture
much of the anger was <unk> especially toward the omission of the film's director ava duvernay whose nomination would have broken fresh ground as the first african american woman to compete for the best director oscar
david <unk> performance as king was likewise <unk> for a best actor slot while neither paul webb's original screenplay nor bradford <unk> <unk> both deemed worthy competitors by movie critics received the <unk> acknowledgment in both their respective categories
<unk> <unk> cried racism at the academy voters even though a few of these critics pointed out that this was the pretty much the same academy that a year ago <unk> the best picture best adapted screenplay and best supporting actress oscars to twelve years a slave
i was prepared to offer that perspective too until i noticed a distressing <unk> looming on this branch
a depiction of african americans in shameful soul <unk> captivity is one thing
african americans organized in open rebellion against their <unk> is very much another
movie history has many films with black slaves and black victims
it's much harder to think of a hollywood movie in which african americans are depicted as the active agents of their own salvation
selma is one of those movies
and its relative dearth of worthy nominations is viewed fairly or not as a collective snub of not just a movie but of african americans vision of their own empowerment
it may have been bad timing as the movie's nationwide release only took place last weekend
and many blamed joseph a. <unk> jr.'s opinion piece in the washington post which <unk> <unk> depiction of his former boss lyndon b. johnson as an impediment in king's campaign
that some journalists brought up <unk> grievances in other articles about the film may have contributed to some restraint at least in the campaign for greater oscar support by paramount <unk> distributor
but one wonders about this
we are in a time when the voting rights legislation passed fifty years ago with the active support of both king and <unk> is under siege both in the courts and in some states
why are people less focused on this clear and present danger and more caught up in questions of historical <unk> of a hollywood movie
well
we're still weeks away from the final vote
and however the chatter has <unk> on selma those who support the movie should be grateful that there is chatter at all carrying the movie to the finish line
with hollywood one never knows
that best picture nomination could very well become a best picture win
but not all <unk> films did so well at the oscar nominations thursday morning
here are five things we learned
one
fifty years after the event it portrayed selma is a flashpoint
the highly praised movie about a key period in the civil rights movement stars david <unk> as the rev
martin luther king jr. and was directed by relative newcomer ava duvernay
both <unk> and duvernay in particular had been singled out for acclaim but when the oscar nominations came down both were shut out
selma ended up with just two nominations
best picture and best song
the internet noting the lack of diversity among the acting and directing categories reacted with <unk>
selma had been criticized for the way it portrayed some aspects of history particularly the role of president lyndon b. johnson but as a movie the reviews were <unk> favorable with ninety nine percents approval on <unk> dot com
noting that other directing nominees weren't <unk> for their movies inaccuracies forbes scott <unk> wrote ms. duvernay more than her peers arguably needed that oscar <unk> as a bargaining chip
he added pointedly i'm angry because one of the best films of the year has been <unk> and that said <unk> apparently worked
but common who received a best song nomination for the film handled the issue <unk>
i believe when people vote they have their perspectives they have what they think is right and we have to understand it's a vote he told cnn
i just say whatever color we are keep making quality work and i know it will eventually be recognized
two
the divide between blockbusters and low budget films grows
with the expanded list of best picture nominees more box office hits films earning one hundred million dollar or more domestically have made the oscar grade in recent years
but of this year's eight nominees the highest <unk> film domestically is the grand budapest hotel which came out in march and it's made just fifty nine million dollar
such hits as gone girl into the woods unbroken and interstellar all considered awards possibilities didn't make the <unk> shortlist
los angeles times film writer steve <unk> who wrote about the <unk> and surprises is surprised himself that more blockbusters didn't make the list
the academy is probably going back and wondering did we accomplish what we wanted to accomplish by expanding it
he says
the fact that there's no gone girl no unbroken no interstellar is certainly notable on an academy list that's meant include films of that type
sure there were some oscar newcomers including benedict cumberbatch eddie redmayne <unk> <unk> <unk> stone and <unk> jones
and though steve <unk> and michael keaton are established performers they'd never gotten oscar nominations
but the nods were full of familiar names some of which surprised observers
robert <unk> who at eighty four is now the oldest supporting actor nominee ever received his seventh nod
<unk> moore now has five nominations
bradley cooper made it for the third year in a row
clint eastwood though not nominated for best director was recognized through his american sniper which got six nominations
and <unk> streep as always is in a class by herself
her nomination for playing a witch in into the woods is her nineteen th overall extending her own record
is it deserved
that's a whole different discussion
four
watch out for budapest and <unk>
birdman and boyhood have been battling it out all awards season
it'll be no different on oscar night
although birdman has more nominations boyhood is generally considered the favorite
but in a mild surprise the grand budapest hotel which has stayed in the discussion despite being released ten months ago has continued to build steam including its best comedy musical win at the golden <unk>
<unk> anderson finally earned a directing nomination and the movie has a <unk> that could make it a popular second choice for oscar voters despite its comic tone
<unk> almost certainly won't win best picture but the nominations for this <unk> winner about a hard driving music teacher and his <unk> student are an achievement on their own given its <unk> budget and limited distribution
<unk> <unk> who's at work on another musical will be a name to watch and j.k. simmons may soon become the most <unk> <unk> in history
besides the selma <unk> perhaps the biggest surprise of the morning was the lack of love for the lego movie
what could have been two hours of product <unk> was instead a clever <unk> film about the need for affection and <unk> and it was widely expected to earn a nomination for best animated feature and perhaps its screenplay
instead it got just one nomination for its song everything is awesome
<unk> wonders whether the movie was too hip for the room
the feeling has been that a more conservative or <unk> voter would not quite spark to the film he says
i think there's a constituency within the branch that maybe felt that this was a little too cutting edge
lego movie co director co writer and co producer philip lord however wasn't going to be denied
he posted a photo of an oscar made of lego
wearing winter clothes and carrying <unk> as they <unk> from the plane that transported them home <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> were greeted on the tarmac in rome thursday by officials including foreign minister <unk> <unk>
<unk> twenty one and <unk> twenty were kidnapped in the northern syrian city of aleppo shortly after they arrived in late july to work on humanitarian aid projects the state run <unk> news agency reported
a video posted on new year's day showed two young women identified as the hostages dressed in islamic <unk> with only their faces showing
they appeared to be seated against a wall
one read a brief statement in english which included
we are in big danger and we could be killed
there were no other details <unk> thursday about the release
the exceptional situation that we're in must lead us to <unk> our rhythm for reducing personnel hollande said wednesday referring to military cuts planned before the attacks
that exceptional situation was a terrorist rampage that was years in the works an aqap leader said in a video claiming u.s. born cleric anwar al awlaki was the mastermind
al awlaki was the terror group's spokesman before a u.s. drone strike killed him in yemen in two thousand and eleven
as intelligence analysts try to piece together whether the gunmen who attacked the satirical magazine met al <unk> on trips to yemen a theory that could be bolstered by the new video's claim france's ultimate response will be colored by numerous factors
an invasion of yemen is unlikely
in terms of international engagement and what's happening in yemen the united states has been engaged in drone strikes for a number of years says david schanzer director of the <unk> center on terrorism and homeland security and a professor of public policy at duke university
i would think the united states is doing about everything that could be done in yemen
of france's deployment of the flagship charles de gaulle schanzer said
i don't know how much of this is symbolic or adding to capability
i just have my doubts
in fact schanzer wrote in an op ed piece this week france and the united states have been on a war footing against terrorism for nearly fourteen years
as early as october two thousand and one france participated in nato operations in afghanistan against al qaeda and the taliban he wrote
in two thousand and thirteen france launched a military operation in mali against an al qaeda affiliate that had overtaken large swaths of the country
and last year france joined the u.s. led military engagement against isis in iraq and syria
on saturday prime minister manuel valls declared that france was at war against terrorism against jihadism against radical <unk>
the attacks and the international response they have elicited <unk> the days following the nine eleven attacks peter <unk> a political science professor at duke wrote in foreign policy
this problem is best understood using the language of war he wrote
yes it requires all of the tools of diplomacy law enforcement intelligence and so on but they are all components of a larger frame that is war
will france go to war
france has moved more and more in the direction of military force against terrorists overseas in recent years christopher chivvis associate director of the international security and defense policy center at the rand corporation said via email
that's a change from a decade ago when the nation tended to focus primarily on the domestic front in counterterrorism strategy
an important factor is recognition that the nature of the terror threat has grown increasingly complex with links to overseas terrorist safe havens according to chivvis
chivvis said the case of mohammed <unk> who killed seven people in a series of attacks in southern france in two thousand and twelve was influential
<unk> was shot dead after a long siege in toulouse that year
<unk> told police he had attended an al qaeda training camp while visiting afghanistan and pakistan according to a french prosecutor
<unk> relatives denied the claim
france's decision to intervene against al qaeda in the islamic maghreb in mali in two thousand and thirteen was shaped by this growing concern about the ways that overseas terrorist safe havens increase the threat to france itself chivvis said
all of this suggests that contrary to what might have been the case a decade ago a french counterterrorism operation against aqap is a real possibility
you probably won't see a repeat of mali where france had two thousand one hundred and fifty soldiers on the ground and one thousand more troops supporting the operation from elsewhere
instead france might chose to use special operations forces which have been working closely with the united states special operations command in recent years or even air strikes against specific targets according to chivvis
from a french perspective airstrikes have the additional benefit of being high profile and showcasing french <unk> he wrote
<unk> was used to great effect in mali
french performed well in mali however when it came to the element of surprise and keeping the initiative against a <unk> al qaeda foe
for france an international and domestic response are in order
in both cases france can not go it alone but needs allies like the united states to back it up chivvis said
there are always risks that such operations can backfire and i'm sure that french leaders are doing their best to weigh those risks against the risks of not responding
it depends on the goals experts say
has it led to the destruction of al qaeda in the arabian peninsula
no schanzer said
has it prevented any nine eleven sized attacks in the united states or anywhere else in the world
the answer to that question is no as well
the effectiveness of the military approach is hard to measure
al awlaki has been taken off the battlefield schanzer said
he was a very threatening individual and even in his death is having influence
some of the things that were done there have contributed and maybe helped to contain this organization but it hasn't led to its elimination
and the rise of isis in syria is <unk>
we did think when bin laden was killed and al qaeda central was really strongly wounded that maybe we were on the down slope of this problem but the civil war in syria has really been a game changer schanzer told cnn
what can france do at home
in his op ed piece schanzer wrote that france should <unk> laws to make support for foreign terrorist organizations whether fighting or training with them a crime punishable by a lengthy period of incarceration
in the united states our material support for terrorism law has been an effective tool for <unk> potential terrorists he wrote
the law is only triggered by specific actions taken in <unk> of terrorist organizations
if applied properly it does not violate civil liberties by punishing people for their ideas
<unk> criminal laws will expand the scope of surveillance against people with terrorist connections according to schanzer
can every single person that has radical impulses be arrested and prosecuted in a democracy
no he told cnn
but people who have known connections and have in some way <unk> with foreign terrorist organizations to me that's a crime and we should consider locking more people up
that's not a long term response to this problem that the whole world is facing but it is something that can reduce the immediate level of risk that they're facing
cherif kouachi thirty two and said kouachi thirty four who authorities say carried out the charlie hebdo shootings were killed during a standoff northeast of paris last week
the brothers were french citizens known to the country's security services according to officials
one spent time in jail for ties to terrorism and was in syria as recently as this summer according to a french source
the other went to yemen for training officials say
before they were killed in a shootout with french security forces one of the brothers spoke on the phone to a journalist from the french news network bfm
we are just telling you that we are the defenders of prophet mohammed he said
i was sent me cherif kouachi by al qaeda in yemen
i went there and sheikh anwar al awlaki financed my trip
before he was killed
cherif kouachi the younger of the brothers was arrested by french authorities in two thousand and five when he was about to leave to fight in iraq
he planned to travel to iraq via syria
he was sentenced to three years in prison in two thousand and eight
schanzer wrote
the key steps france needs to take to address the current threat have everything to do with expanding domestic counterterrorism and little to do with the tools of war
his was the first execution in oklahoma since a controversial lethal injection which was widely seen as botched in april
warner was convicted in two thousand and three for the first degree rape and murder of his then girlfriend's eleven month old daughter in the summer of one thousand nine hundred and ninety seven
he was executed at the oklahoma state <unk> in <unk> about one hundred and thirty miles east of oklahoma city
warner was pronounced dead at seven twenty eight p.m. ct
justice was served tonight as the state executed charles warner for the heinous crime of raping and murdering an infant said oklahoma gov
mary <unk>
a reporter from the associated press sean murphy was among the witnesses
he recounted <unk> last words
they poked me five times
it hurt
it feels like acid warner said according to murphy
i'm sorry for all the pain that was caused
i'm not a monster
i didn't do everything they said i did
i love people
i love my family
i love jesus warner said
he thanked his mother and sister for their support and said to tell my baby girl she means the world to me
according to murphy the execution began at seven ten p.m. ct
once it started warner said
my body is on fire
no one should go through this
i'm not afraid to die
<unk> all going to die he said
other than his statements warner did not appear to be suffering and did not show any obvious signs of distress murphy told other reporters
before the execution a spokesman with the oklahoma department of corrections had said that warner was scheduled to be executed using a three drug combination of midazolam <unk> <unk> and potassium <unk>
midazolam a <unk> that is still not fda approved is supposed to render the prisoner unconscious
<unk> <unk> is a paralytic which is meant to <unk> all muscle movement and stop <unk>
potassium <unk> role is to activate nerves and induce cardiac arrest
<unk> attorney dale baich had filed a motion with the u.s. supreme court asking for a stay and asked the court to review oklahoma's lethal injection policies in general
the court denied the requests
of particular concern is the use of midazolam which has been involved in several extremely problematic executions including the gruesome and horrific execution of clayton lockett in oklahoma and the two hour prolonged death of joseph wood in arizona in july two thousand and fourteen baich said
warner was originally scheduled for execution on the same night as lockett april twenty nine two thousand and fourteen but the execution was called off after the state took forty three minutes to execute lockett a controversial event that was witnessed by media and state officials
witnesses said lockett was <unk> and <unk> on the gurney as well as struggling to speak before officials blocked their view
the execution was halted but lockett eventually died
a team of medical <unk> later ruled that lockett died from the state's lethal injection
the report which was released in september by the oklahoma department of corrections called the manner of death a <unk> ordered execution
lockett's execution was the first time oklahoma had used midazolam as the first element in its three drug cocktail
a year is a long time to stay <unk>
but staying a year in space has some special challenges
there's what to pack
how many changes of clothes do you bring
kelly says nasa supplies most of what he needs but he's taking his own tool pouch some <unk> and special shoes to use when he's lifting weights
i bought a special kind of shoes i thought would be better for that kelly said at a nasa briefing on thursday
then there's what to do for a year in space
you get a great view of earth so the scenery is amazing
but the space station orbits earth about every ninety minutes or about sixteen times a day
could get a little repetitive
so how do you keep from getting bored
experiments
lots and lots of experiments
nasa says space station crews normally work on about two hundred experiments over six months but kelly will be doing many more
he says he's actually fascinated with the space station itself as a giant experiment in living in space
building this facility that allows us to understand how to operate for long periods of time in space to allow us someday to go to mars
in his free time kelly says he'll spend a lot of time talking to people on earth messaging on social media reading email watching tv and writing
i'm going to keep a personal journal of the experience kelly said
he also will share some of his journal with researchers studying the psychological impacts of long term space flight
will he tell all
i plan to be completely honest about it he said but
who knows maybe there are some crazy thoughts i'll have at the end that i wouldn't want to share
kelly also might get to do a bit of singing
british singer sarah <unk> will visit the station as a space tourist during <unk> year in orbit
will he and the other crew members sing along with her
it will be either all of us or none of us kelly joked
one other thing kelly has to plan for
near zero gravity
turns out our bodies really like gravity
stay in orbit too long and your eyes heart bones muscles basically everything change and usually not for the better
on the upside you get a bit taller
at least briefly
you do grow when you're up there for a long time kelly said
unfortunately it doesn't last
but it did last long enough that i could stand next to my brother and look down at him a little bit
kelly was joking about his twin former astronaut mark kelly
mark kelly has volunteered for nasa's twins study ten investigations into how the identical twins change over the year in two very different environments
even though mark will be on earth getting poked and prodded by researchers while scott makes history in orbit scott said his brother doesn't mind
he thinks it's great that he can still be a participant in this scott kelly said
the kelly brothers experiments should help nasa understand what happens to astronauts who spend a long time in space and help plan longer <unk> to an asteroid or to mars
despite all the health risks and personal sacrifices kelly said there's a big reason to stay in space a year
it's a lot of fun he said
space station is a magical place
the mission is a first for nasa but not for russia
between one thousand nine hundred and eighty seven and one thousand nine hundred and ninety five four <unk> spent a year or more in space
and another russian will be with kelly for his yearlong mission
<unk> <unk> <unk>
both men are space veterans
kelly has flown on two shuttle missions and has already done two stints on the space station
in all he's logged more than one hundred and eighty days in space
<unk> has spent one hundred and seventy six days in space
the two will ride to the space station on a russian <unk> spacecraft along with russian <unk> <unk> <unk> who is staying for six months
the trio will launch from the <unk> <unk> in kazakhstan on march twenty seven
ali who has parkinson's disease has been in an undisclosed hospital this week getting follow up care for a urinary tract infection a spokesman for the family said thursday
bob <unk> said ali is in stable condition and doctors indicated he would be released friday
ali was initially released from the hospital on january seven after an eighteen day stay
born <unk> clay the fighter won an olympic gold medal as a light heavyweight at eighteen
in one thousand nine hundred and sixty four he became world heavyweight champion in an upset victory against <unk> <unk>
shortly thereafter he changed his name to muhammad ali to reflect his conversion to islam
the boxer was also known for his protest against the vietnam war and refusal to be drafted into service because of his religious conviction
he won his first thirty one fights before losing to joe frazier in a one thousand nine hundred and seventy one fight hailed by some boxing experts as one of the greatest matches of all time
he retired from boxing in one thousand nine hundred and eighty one as a four time heavyweight champion and announced his diagnosis with parkinson's disease three years later
we've got isis
they've got the wrong philosophy but they're willing to die for what they believe while we are <unk> giving away every belief and every value for the sake of political correctness he said during his speech at the rnc's winter meeting
we have to change that
carson acknowledged his comments were likely to spark controversy and gain headlines but he preemptively dismissed the press attention
they are just so ridiculous he said to laughter from the crowd
the remarks are similar to ones he made previously <unk> the united states government to nazi germany in that both he argued worked to silence their opponents
carson stood by those comments when pressed in an interview with cnn's wolf blitzer
it's that very penchant for frank and often controversial comments that has made him so popular with the gop base and turned the retired neurosurgeon into a rising conservative star who just last month polled third in a cnn orc survey of the potential gop presidential field
he's made no secret of his interest in the race and recently said he feels fingers from god to run
many within the establishment wing of the party remain wary of him however because of his talent for the very remarks that make him so popular with the far right
he also started a firestorm of criticism over comments he made that obamacare was the worst thing to happen to the u.s. since slavery
but his appearance at the rnc's winter meeting alongside the likes of wisconsin gov
scott walker and two thousand and twelve gop presidential nominee mitt romney suggest that carson's popularity on the right has earned him some notice from the establishment as the party charts its course heading into two thousand and sixteen
he got that reminder again thursday when charles warner became the first inmate to be executed in oklahoma since last april
that's when clayton lockett died in what was widely seen as a botched lethal injection process
i've seen it on tv says glossip fifty one in a telephone call from death row
he says he's <unk> with his fate though he has always maintained his innocence
he says he has long believed that without mental preparation things will not go well in his final moments
but when he learned that lockett's was one of the longest executions in u.s. history and that he <unk> and <unk> on the gurney for forty three minutes before dying of a heart attack a new anxiety set in
i am worried they will <unk> it again he says
the <unk> execution horrified people around the world and the state put a moratorium on carrying out the ultimate punishment until it could fully review what happened
but oklahoma's decision to go forth thursday with a variation of the same drug formula concerned death penalty lawyers who say the state still risks violating the constitution by <unk> cruel and unusual punishment on inmates
attorneys for warner glossip and two other oklahoma inmates facing execution appealed to the u.s. supreme court on wednesday for stays until the new protocol could be evaluated
but the justices voted five four to deny the application
in her dissent justice sonia sotomayor wrote that she was deeply troubled by the continued use of midazolam a sedative at the heart of the lethal injection controversy
attorney dale baich one of the lawyers who filed the suit says the supreme court will have to revisit this issue in the near future
the drugs and drug combinations used in executions today vary <unk> across different <unk> he says
this experimentation has led to the predictable but tragic result of multiple botched executions
the court's guidance on the practices currently employed in lethal injection is urgently needed
oklahoma officials say however that they have addressed the concerns that surfaced after lockett and put new equipment and protocol in place
so shortly after seven p.m. in a <unk> death chamber the lethal cocktail began flowing into the veins of warner convicted of the first degree rape and murder of his then girlfriend's eleven month old daughter
he was pronounced dead at seven twenty eight p.m
glossip is scheduled to die next on january twenty nine
oklahoma spent seventy one thousand dollar <unk> the chamber and the adjacent witness rooms so that <unk> have more space
the state also spent thirty four thousand dollar on new equipment including a twelve thousand five hundred dollar gurney that replaced one from the one thousand nine hundred and fifty s and an ultrasound machine to help detect veins
but the state did not <unk> it necessary to change its controversial three drug formula
of particular concern is the use of the sedative midazolam also used in two other executions that went awry
dennis mcguire <unk> for twenty six minutes in ohio and joseph wood <unk> more than six hundred times and took two hours to die in arizona
witnesses in oklahoma said lockett regained consciousness after the sedative was administered
they said he <unk> and suffered for many minutes
lockett's execution was halted after his iv needle <unk> and <unk> blood but he later died
a state investigation linked the problem to the iv lines not being inserted correctly
this has been a problem in other executions as well
what they have not done is investigate whether their use of midazolam in the lockett execution contributed to the <unk> that resulted says richard <unk> executive director of the death penalty information center which does not officially take a position but is widely seen as anti capital punishment
oklahoma upped its dosage of midazolam to five hundred milligrams compared with the one hundred milligrams lockett got
but <unk> says there is no proof that increasing the dosage will avoid problems
they have not shown that this drug will produce the necessary level of unconsciousness to allow the execution to proceed <unk> he says
florida uses the same three drug cocktail and it too executed a convicted murderer thursday after the supreme court gave the green light
johnny shane <unk> was declared dead at eight sixteen p.m. at the florida state prison in <unk>
until two thousand and ten states employed a fairly standard drug formula to carry out the death penalty that included the anesthetic sodium <unk>
but after the sole u.s. manufacturer stopped making the drug and european companies refused to sell it for use in executions states faced drug shortages for the lethal cocktail and searched desperately for alternatives
midazolam commonly used as a sedative before surgery was first used in florida in two thousand and eleven without any guarantees that the inmate would remain sedated long enough
witnesses who watched convicted murderer william <unk> die said that he remained conscious longer than those who were killed with the old formula
death penalty opponents say the use of midazolam amounts essentially to experimentation on human beings
but four states use the drug in their lethal injections
the executions thursday in oklahoma and florida began with midazolam
then the inmates were injected with a paralytic agent to prevent the inmate from <unk> followed by potassium <unk> which stopped their hearts
glossip thinks about what he might feel after he is strapped into the gurney and the drugs begin <unk> through his veins
he has spent the last few weeks imagining a disastrous end like lockett's
helen <unk> a catholic <unk> who ministers to the condemned and has spoken with glossip says he is haunted by lockett's agony
he's scared she says
that the sedative won't do its job that he will be helpless to stop the pain
it's difficult for many people to feel any sympathy for a man who was convicted in a hire for murder scheme that resulted in the one thousand nine hundred and ninety seven death of barry alan van treese owner of a best budget inn in oklahoma city
van <unk> family appeared at a clemency hearing for glossip in october and spoke of the many ways they missed a husband father and brother
they said too often victims of crime are forgotten in the capital punishment process
i will speak for my brother said kenneth van treese
it hurts like hell to have your head <unk> in with a baseball bat
do not feel sorry for the <unk> who took my life
van <unk> sister <unk> van treese <unk> told the clemency board that the death penalty was not revenge but the law
but attorneys for death row inmates say oklahoma's execution protocol remains unconstitutional
their appeal to the supreme court says the state is relying on a drug that can not reliably produce or maintain a deep <unk> unconsciousness
baich one of <unk> attorneys says midazolam was not part of the lethal injection protocol approved by the supreme court in two thousand and eight
simply increasing the dosage he says does not overcome the risk and leaves oklahoma open to inhumane action
oklahoma's current execution protocol creates a substantial risk of severe pain needless suffering and a lingering death baich says
cnn contacted the oklahoma department of corrections for comment and was referred to the execution protocol posted on its website
glossip says he can't believe oklahoma resumed the use of a sedative that has been so problematic one that ironically bought him time
he might have been dead already his initial execution date was set in november but the state postponed it because it said it wasn't quite prepared with its new procedures
for a while glossip got to leave a special holding cell for the final thirty five days before execution and return to his old one located beneath the death chamber
he was glad for that
in the holding cell two fluorescent lights <unk> down on him twenty four seven
his <unk> wrapped television set was revoked
he was allowed a single book but chose to write letters instead
many inmates ask for a bible he says
at christmas he launched a hunger strike
that way he could have some agency over his death he thought
but <unk> who is planning to be with him at his execution persuaded him to eat
i feel especially responsible for richard she says
a few days ago i urged him to eat again so he can fight to expose the horrible injustice not only for himself but for all who go through this torture
glossip has exhausted all appeals of his verdict and sentence
he was tried twice for van <unk> killing the first conviction was tossed because of incompetent legal representation
but a second jury also convicted him
prosecutors said glossip hired maintenance worker justin <unk> to take a baseball bat and <unk> their boss van treese to death because glossip thought he would be fired
at trial <unk> testified that he killed van treese at <unk> behest and received a life sentence
glossip was sentenced to death
twice a jury has heard the evidence against richard glossip and twice a jury has convicted him and sentenced him to death for his role in the murder of barry van treese says aaron cooper a spokesman for the oklahoma attorney general
glossip holds steadfast to his innocence
he says he is being put to death even though the real killer lied and gets to live
i feel sorry for barry's family glossip says
but i did not commit a crime
he adds at first i was angry at justin but now i feel sorry for him
he's afraid of how oklahoma will kill him if he owns up to what really happened just like i am afraid of how they'll kill me
it's fear making him lie about what happened
these days glossip thinks about his late parents his mother died just a year ago and fourteen siblings
he thinks about what it would feel like to see green grass and trees again
to smell fresh air
they are things that van <unk> family wishes their loved one could see now too

on wednesday the climbers kevin jorgeson and tommy caldwell became the first people in the world to free climb the dawn wall route of <unk> el <unk> face
it's a path marked by pebble size holds according to the new york times so sharp they'll make your fingers bleed
like literally will make your fingers bleed
check out this photo from <unk> instagram account
he reportedly <unk> and super glued the ends of his fingers to try to make them strong enough to grip the nearly sheer face of rock
it's one of the hardest climbing routes in the world
which is why jorgeson and caldwell who started the journey on december twenty seven and who slept in tents <unk> to the vertical face could be forgiven for thinking that they conquered this route or this mountain
but thankfully that's not how they see it
here's what jorgeson had to say on twitter
it's about realizing a dream
competing with yourself
achieving the impossible
being struck by the <unk> of nature as it's clear the pair often were based on their social media posts
but certainly not about conquering it
that's a refreshing opinion in the age of <unk> and mountain top removal
we live in a culture that tends to nature as a thing to be <unk> and used not respected
jorgeson and <unk> epic ascent of the dawn wall should be a reminder of how small we humans are in the face of the natural world and also of how much we tiny humans can accomplish with enough hard work
the problem is that most of our efforts are <unk>
rather than seeking to understand and explore the many uncharted parts of the world the ninety five percents of the ocean that is unseen by humans for example we extract capital
we drill deeper wells into the ground sucking out water at such an <unk> rate that california's central valley is sinking
elsewhere we inject wastewater into the land as part of the process of pulling out oil and natural gas
these injections according to the u.s. geological survey contribute to earthquakes in odd places like oklahoma
we've turned farms into factories
animals are bigger <unk> <unk> products not living things
or worse they're status symbols as in illegal rhino horn or pangolin meat
the drop in the price of oil has slowed some efforts to go after the hardest to get energy sources like oil hidden below the ocean floor and underneath more than a mile of water
but it hasn't changed this ethic this core belief which you can link back to the bible if you wish that humans have <unk> over the world that it's ours to rule and or <unk> as we choose
there are however signs this mindset is changing
new theories suggest we can and should live in partnership with the natural world removing <unk> from rivers and letting them run free into the flood plain
<unk> energy from the wind not from deep beneath the ocean
the <unk> documentary <unk> gives a sense of this seismic shift
the yosemite climbers offer hope as well
free climbs are <unk> wrote andrew <unk> for national geographic
the harder the movements get twisting stretching <unk> swinging <unk> the more painstaking the process of solving the puzzle becomes
the world is a puzzle to be solved an adventure to be had
the rest of us would benefit from seeing it that way too
do you think your husband is dead
her mouth twists <unk> her young face tears <unk> in her already <unk> eyes
i don't know
i pray to god to give him another chance she finally manages to <unk>
her sadness is heavy and blankets both of us
she tells me she has three children and they last saw their father four months ago when he went back to his army unit on the front line in nigeria's battle with the radical islamist extremist group boko haram
his friends last saw him bloodied and shooting as boko haram fighters advanced and they all fled
if all this wasn't trauma enough the young woman says the army has deserted her too
they didn't tell me anything they still haven't told me what happened and they didn't pay me anything and no one is feeding us in the barracks she said
we are in northern nigeria a few hours drive north of the capital where the mostly muslim north meets the mostly christian south
just last month a double suicide bombing killed twelve people in a busy central market in the region
driving northeast of here toward the borders with chad cameroon and niger puts you in the heart of boko haram territory a land mass the size of belgium
so it's no surprise that the area is home to many thousands of troops and as i am finding out it's also the backdrop of many more heart wrenching stories
a mile or so from his base i meet a soldier on a remote <unk> hill
he is a veteran of african union and united nations peacekeeping missions in liberia and sudan a professional soldier
we sit on plastic chairs as he tells me his story
he too was left on the battlefield by his comrades as they fled for safety in the face of a boko haram attack
he doesn't blame them
the major problem the soldiers have is they don't have the equipment to fight he says
boko haram has anti aircraft guns which he says are accurate up to three quarters of a mile
all the nigerian military has he says are ak forty seven small machine guns accurate up to a few hundred meters
often the nigerian soldiers are given only sixty bullets each so they quickly run out
boko haram he says has large supplies of ammunition and more fighters
although the nigerian soldiers do win some fights he says they are regularly forced to turn tail and run for their lives by the sheer volume of gunfire from boko haram fighters
it took him three days on foot alone to get back to his base seventy kilometers away
when he arrived his wife told him to quit the army but his troubles were only just beginning
army medics refused to pay the two hundred dollar for medicine to treat his injuries
morale in the army is sinking he says
that night i meet a young officer who like the other soldier is not authorized to talk to me
our conversation is held in a hurry in a tiny <unk> hut that sells biscuits and <unk> drinks at a <unk> on the outskirts of a town
corruption he tells me is the root of the nigerian military's problem
not just the generals
everybody in the country wants to get rich by any means necessary he says
the soldiers don't ever benefit from the billions allocated to the defense budget he explains
he even had to buy his own uniform
the troop morale is actually very low very low because we are not issued a uniform we buy the uniforms ourselves he explained
the other soldier i met on the hill told me this too
when they go into battle no one has the same uniform so when they run from boko haram it's chaos
they don't know who is friend or foe whom to shoot and whom to help
most soldiers live in fear the young officer tells me
a fear of what will happen to them and how long they can survive in this battle he says
the worrying doesn't stop there
they see enough war <unk> on the base to know the grim reality of what can happen to their loved ones if they die
a widow i meet explains
her husband was killed in battle over a year ago she tells me
when my husband died they never called me to tell me that i lost my husband she says
they buried him without notifying me
she gets no army pension and she says there are many more like her
they feel abandoned afraid to speak out because they still live in the barracks
government officials tell us they will look into these shortcomings that they are working on getting better weapons for the troops
if they do according to the soldiers i met it will easily turn the tide in this war
the pope made the gesture and accompanying remarks while flying from sri lanka to the philippines where he started a five day visit thursday
he didn't mention charlie hebdo the satirical magazine that was targeted by terrorists after it depicted the prophet mohammed in cartoons something that many muslims find offensive
the paris magazine became a terrorist target after publishing one such cartoon years ago and after last week's attack it placed mohammed on its cover this time showing him crying and holding a sign with the rallying cry je suis charlie french for i am charlie
still even if he didn't explicitly name the publication the pope was clear that he was referring to the general debate over what's happened in france including how people might react if they feel someone made a slight to their religious faith
everyone has not only the liberty but also the obligation to say what he thinks to help the common good francis said
however they should not do so if it <unk> people
and if someone does get offended
the pope made reference to alberto gasbarri a man who organizes papal trips and was then standing next to him on the plane
if dr. gasbarri a great friend says a swear word against my mother then a punch awaits him francis said
it's normal it's normal
one can not provoke one can not insult other people's faith one can not make fun of faith
while making this comment vatican radio reported that the pontiff gestured with a pretend punch directed at gasbarri an action many journalists interpreted as a joke
notably in the same conversation francis steadfastly denounced the terrorists killings and the idea that anyone as the france attackers apparently did could pretend to justify such violence in the name of god
one can not make war kill in the name of one's own religion francis said on his way to the philippines
to kill in the name of god is an aberration
the vatican later responded to a cnn question about the punch remark specifically
in an email vatican spokesman thomas rosica told cnn that the pope's expression is in no way intended to be interpreted as somehow justifying last week's violence and he pointed out that the pope has spoken out clearly against the terror and violence that occurred in paris and in other parts of the world
the pope's words about dr. gasbarri were spoken colloquially and in friendly intimate manner among colleagues and friends rosica said thursday
his response might be similar to something each of us has felt when those <unk> to us are insulted or harmed
rosica explained francis remarks as consistent with his free style of speech a <unk> and <unk> approach that has earned him admirers
such remarks must be taken at face value and not distorted or manipulated the vatican spokesman said
in fact the pope has been one of the world's most outspoken advocates for peace and against war since taking that position in two thousand and thirteen
and what he said on the manila bound plane doesn't change that according to rosica
pope francis has not advocated violence with his words on the flight the spokesman said
a western intelligence source tells cnn that the ongoing terror threat appears to involve up to twenty sleeper cells of between one hundred and twenty to one hundred and eighty people ready to strike in france germany belgium and the netherlands
the source said that european union and middle east intelligence agencies identified an imminent threat to belgium possibly also to the netherlands
a terror cell on the brink of carrying out an attack was the target of a raid thursday that left two suspects dead belgian authorities said
a third suspect was injured and taken into custody in the operation at a building in the eastern city of verviers prosecutor's spokesman thierry werts told reporters
a senior belgian counterterrorism official told cnn that the alleged terror cell is believed to have received instructions from isis
some members of the cell had traveled to syria and met with isis which plotted the attacks as retaliation for u.s. led airstrikes in syria and iraq the belgian source said
this was in the framework of an operation looking into an operational cell made up of people some of whom coming back from syria werts said
the investigation made it possible to determine that the group was about to carry out major terrorist attacks in belgium imminently
the operation which authorities said was ongoing added fresh fuel to a fear that's been simmering for months as thousands of europeans went off to join isis fighters in syria
would they bring the war back with them when they returned home
<unk> hausman was inside his house in verviers when he heard the explosions start
from the window he saw police officers firing assault rifles at a house nearby
he watched smoke rising after another explosion went off
then police entered the house hausman told cnn's erin burnett <unk>
and even though he couldn't see exactly what happened next he heard it
i can hear it
everybody can hear it hausman said
in this little city everybody heard the sound
shouts gunfire and the sound of glass shattering echo in a video hausman posted on youtube
the suspects immediately and for long minutes fired using weapons and hand weapons before being <unk> werts said
verviers is about sixty nine miles east southeast of brussels and two hundred miles northeast of paris where terrorist attacks last week heightened alerts in europe
cnn affiliate <unk> reported that the terrorism investigation in belgium started weeks ago and there has been no connection established with the paris attacks
a western intelligence source said the paris attacks played a role in accelerating the timing of the belgian operation
one reason
the arrest of a belgian arms dealer suspected of providing weapons to amedy coulibaly the man who attacked a paris kosher supermarket and also pledged allegiance to isis
belgian investigators questioned him and searched his possessions the source said
through the arms dealer the investigators got a number of positive hits on suspected extremists already known to authorities
but in the wake of the paris attacks the source said it stepped up the urgency
the trio targeted in the verviers raid had been under surveillance for some time werts said
additional anti terrorism operations are underway in other cities the belgian counterterrorism official said
in recent weeks european security services received indications of an ominous possibility
that isis may have started directing european extremists in syria and iraq to launch terrorist attacks back in their home countries the belgian counterterrorism official said
security agencies in several european countries were intensely investigating several groups of returnees from syria and iraq the official said including the group that authorities confronted in belgium
the belgian counterterrorism official said indications of isis ordering attacks in europe mark an apparent significant shift by the terrorist group
before the air campaign against it the official said there was little indication isis leaders were directly plotting attacks in the west
instead the group prioritized its project to create an islamic caliphate
the official named france the uk and belgium as countries facing a particular threat
counterterrorism agencies in germany also are on high alert because of the number of fighters who have traveled
several european countries including britain france belgium and the netherlands are participating in the air campaign against isis in iraq
why would isis change tack
partly because of increased competition between isis and al qaeda affiliates including the khorasan group in syria to be seen as the standard <unk> of global jihad according to the official
the official said there is also significant concern about khorasan attack plotting against europe
u.s. officials previously told cnn that french al qaeda operative and bomb maker david drugeon was suspected to be talent spotting european jihadis in syria for operations in europe
drugeon was injured in a drone strike in november but is believed to be still alive
last week andrew parker the head of britain's security service mi five warned a group of core al qaeda terrorists in syria is planning mass casualty attacks against the west an apparent reference to the khorasan group
european officials have been warning for months about the unprecedented challenge posed by returning fighters
more than three thousand europeans have left to fight in syria in recent years
the total number who have returned to europe is estimated to be over five hundred including two hundred and fifty who have returned to the uk almost two hundred to france and about seventy to belgium
several returning isis fighters have already been implicated in attack plans in europe
in february police in cannes broke up an alleged plot to bomb targets in france by ibrahim boudina a french algerian extremist who allegedly had just returned from fighting with isis in syria
police said they found almost a kilogram of the high explosive <unk> inside soda cans in his family's cannes apartment building
<unk> and nails were attached to one with sticky tape as shrapnel according to sources briefed on the investigation
boudina has denied the allegations against him
mehdi nemmouche a french algerian isis fighter who allegedly helped guard western hostages in syria before returning to europe allegedly shot and killed four people at a jewish museum in brussels in may
nemmouche was arrested in france and extradited to face trial in belgium
he has denied the charges
in both the cannes and brussels plots investigators believe it is possible the men were acting on their own steam
no evidence has been publicly released suggesting isis leadership signed off on the plots
but the worry now is that isis has <unk> toward launching attacks in europe
european officials say all this adds up to an unprecedented terrorist threat in europe
late last year just weeks before the attacks on a satirical magazine jewish grocery and police officers in paris french prime minister manuel valls said france had never faced a greater terrorist threat
isis runs large training facilities in syria has deep financial pockets and access to thousands of potential european recruits

the country's friends in the west are also under fire for <unk> <unk> after badawi endured the first of twenty consecutive weekly floggings in jeddah
canada is deeply concerned by the public flogging of raif badawi
this punishment is a violation of human dignity and freedom of expression and we call for clemency in this case canada's foreign affairs minister said in a statement
while mr. badawi is not a canadian citizen we will continue to make our position known both publicly and through diplomatic channels
the u.s. state department described the sentence as inhumane
in a statement it said
the united states government calls on saudi authorities to cancel this brutal punishment and to review badawi's case and sentence
the united states strongly opposes laws including <unk> laws that restrict the exercise of these freedoms and urges all countries to uphold these rights in practice
<unk> al rasheed a professor at the middle east center of the london school of economics told cnn's <unk> anderson this week

the country executed eighty seven people in two thousand and fourteen most by decapitation human rights watch told cnn
the kingdom will not back down on the issue of justice the issue of applying the rules of god particularly in capital cases
and no sentence is carried out without providing the full legal right to the defendant said al muadi
under saudi interpretation of islamic jurisprudence charges of murder fall under a system of retribution which allows the family of the victim to choose the fate of the perpetrator
relatives may accept <unk> meaning blood money instead of the death penalty
we emphasize respect for the right to life as one of the fundamental rights guaranteed by the law
it should not make us forget the rights of other parties violated by the perpetrators which has to be seen with the same degree of respect al muadi said when asked specifically about the practice of beheadings
last month saudi <unk> cut off filipino worker <unk> <unk> head for killing his employer in two thousand and ten a cnn affiliate in the philippines reported

the department of foreign affairs of the philippines says that the family of the victim opted for the death penalty rather than accept any money from lana and initially tried to raise funds to pay the saudi relatives
this is a dark day for migrant filipinos especially for those on death row abroad a statement by the group <unk> international which defends the rights of workers abroad said
the statement added that the case highlighted the vulnerability of migrant laborers
the scheduled flogging of raif badawi for blogging about the discussion of faith has begun

badawi's wife <unk> <unk> said the video was difficult to watch
it's a scene i can not describe
it was horrible she said from canada
every lash killed me she told cnn
the flogging again shines the spotlight on the nation that analysts say effectively <unk> its justice system to silence dissent and create strife among opposition on both sides of the aisle
u.s. officials have also called on saudi officials to withdraw the sentence and review badawi's case
but saudi arabia maintains its right to carry out their laws
raif badawi and others with charges against them are afforded all legal rights including the right to attorney said saudi arabia's mohammed al muadi
but analysts say it's as much about the internal conflict within the country
the case of raif al badawi tells us a great deal about the polarization in saudi society between the islamists and the liberals professor <unk> al rasheed explained
the saudi regime tries to appease both by showing as if it is equal in punishing both groups that endorse discourse or opposition
now the french government is helping out bathily by making him a citizen
the malian <unk> citizenship application which he filed in july will be expedited interior minister bernard cazeneuve announced thursday
cazeneuve will conduct bathily's citizenship ceremony himself tuesday
this event will add to what has been an emotional few weeks for bathily starting with his heroic actions friday after a gunman burst in while he was working at the kosher hyper <unk> grocery store near paris porte de vincennes
the man took several people hostage but not the fifteen whom bathily led downstairs into a walk in freezer
bathily who describes himself as a practicing muslim told cnn affiliate bfmtv he switched off the freezer turned off the lights and told everyone to stay calm
i'm the one is going to go out the twenty four year old reportedly told the customers
i took the elevator and went upstairs
bathily told bfmtv that he went up after the hostage taker whom authorities have identified as amedy coulibaly asked us to all come upstairs
if they didn't
otherwise he would kill everyone who was downstairs the young man said
so bathily did go upstairs taking a freight elevator
but he didn't go toward coulibaly
instead he ran outside
police apprehended bathily there and he told them the location of the freezer and gave details about those inside
when came out they congratulated me bathily told bfmtv
that's because his actions might have saved their lives
four people plus the gunman ended up being killed by the time the hostage situation ended
french media quickly ran with the story of bathily with l'express newspaper proclaiming lassana bathily malian muslim hero of the hostage situation in vincennes
people around the world also cheered bathily with about three hundred thousand signing a change dot org petition asking that he be given the legion <unk> a highly prestigious award given to those who done exceptional things for france
even in darkness and <unk> there's always a ray of light somewhere wrote the <unk> creator <unk> <unk>
such is the case with lassana bathily

can failing be good for your career
on wednesday al qaeda released a video featuring nasr ibn ali al ansi one of its top commanders in yemen claiming responsibility for the horrific attack last week on the offices of the satirical magazine charlie hebdo
he gave two reasons for the attack
first he claimed it was in revenge for charlie hebdo's printing of cartoons lampooning the prophet mohammed
al ansi then went on to state in much greater detail that the attack was in response to france and the west killing muslims
we will tell you once again
stop spilling our blood
and then he urged muslims across the world to take <unk> for muslim blood spilled
well if spilling muslim blood is the deciding factor for us muslims to decide who we should take <unk> against then al ansi and others in al qaeda should immediately go into hiding
simply put al qaeda has been slaughtering muslims for years
islamic clerics doctors nurses women children etc
you name any type of muslim and al qaeda has butchered them
in fact a report released in two thousand and nine by the combating terrorism center at west point documented the people killed by al qaeda between two thousand and four and two thousand and eight
it found that only twelve percents of the victims of al qaeda were westerners
that suggests that al qaeda has killed seven times as many muslims as non muslims
and these attacks were just the ones for which al qaeda had publicly claimed responsibility
and since that report al qaeda in yemen has engaged in even more vicious attacks on muslims
keep in mind that ninety nine percents of the population of yemen is muslim so with a few exceptions virtually every person the group kills there is a muslim
in december two thousand and fourteen for example an al qaeda bomb killed fifteen children and ten adults when the bus they were on was blown up by an al qaeda car bomb intended for a competing militia leader in the area
this attack followed another in which al qaeda sent a suicide bomber into a crowd of protesters in the nation's capital killing forty seven people and injuring one hundred and forty
and back in december two thousand and thirteen al qaeda launched an attack on a hospital killing fifty two people and wounding one hundred and sixty seven with two car bombs before <unk> shooting patients and doctors in the hospital
the list goes on but al qaeda is not alone in killing muslims who stand in its way
isis has done the same in iraq and syria
a u.n. report released late last year found that isis had killed thousands of muslims both sunni and shia between july and september of that year
this includes the slayings of three nurses in mosul iraq because they refused to provide medical care to isis fighters
isis also killed numerous sunni imams for refusing to swear allegiance to isis and beheaded another sunni leader for refusing to support the group
and the reality is that that's truly what al qaeda and isis are about
they are not about the concept of submit to islam or die as some have claimed
it's submit to isis al qaeda or die
both organizations clearly don't care how many muslims they kill
yet at the same time they will both claim they are carrying out their actions in the name of islam
in fact al ansi stated in wednesday's video that the terrorist brothers who carried out the attack on the charlie hebdo officers were two heroes of islam
he couldn't be more wrong
but that isn't to say there weren't heroes of islam in paris that day it's just that they are two quite different people
ahmed merabet was the french police officer shot in cold blood while lying on the sidewalk by the so called heroes of islam
as his brother stated at a press conference merabet was a proud muslim who gave his life defending french values of liberty equality and fraternity
and there was lassana bathily the muslim employee at the kosher <unk> in paris who reportedly saved the lives of seven jewish patrons by helping them hide when amedy coulibaly entered the store with guns <unk>
bathily's actions exemplified the famous <unk> verse whoever saves one it is as if he had saved mankind entirely
obviously calling out the hypocrisy of al qaeda and isis won't change these organizations goals they will continue to invoke islam as cover for their political ambitions because it helps them <unk> new recruits and raise funds which are vital for their continued existence
but maybe if their hypocrisy is consistently laid bare then it might help all understand the true motivation of these terrorist groups and hopefully even give pause to any muslims thinking of joining their un islamic cause
after all al qaeda and isis aren't interested in upholding the principles of islam
they are focused only on power however many muslim lives they take
in a <unk> voice it may recite a yarn of weary <unk> <unk> on horses backs in the parched rocky nevada wilderness
it may talk about riding in a <unk> <unk> across neighboring utah more than a decade before it became a state of the union
great basin national park workers found the <unk> model one thousand eight hundred and seventy three <unk> against a tree in the desert in november
who knows how many years the rifle stood there after someone left behind the model called the gun that won the west
did they have to depart in a hurry running from danger
or did they not see it as it stood neatly <unk> against the arid trunk of the <unk> tree
wind snow desert sun have beaten years of <unk> into the <unk> <unk> stock and <unk> its barrel brown along with its receiver and signature figure eight repeating <unk>
but its model name remains steadfastly <unk> on its tang along with a serial number
the great basin national park's staff checked it against the <unk> west firearms museum's records
the gun was manufactured and shipped in one thousand eight hundred and eighty two the museum told them
<unk> records do not indicate who purchased the rifle from the warehouse or where it was shipped the park said on its facebook page
cultural researchers will try to squeeze out a few more secrets about the <unk> history from old newspapers and family trees
then conservationists will not restore but <unk> it in the condition in which was found
it will become part of the display commemorating the park's thirty th birthday in two thousand and sixteen
the one thousand eight hundred and seventy three model was widespread
between one thousand eight hundred and seventy three and one thousand nine hundred and sixteen more than seven hundred and sixty thousand were made the park said
today <unk> offer hundreds to around ten thousand dollars for one online
a <unk> <unk> association says model one thousand eight hundred and seventy three was <unk> in one thousand nine hundred and nineteen
but in one thousand eight hundred and eighty two the price dropped by half to twenty five dollar dollars apiece the park said
it put them in the hands of many towards the end of indian wars in the southwest
but those battles were mostly in surrounding states particularly fights against <unk> warriors who refused to be confined to reservations in arizona
that would seem a safe distance away
the spot where the gun was found in the great basin desert could hardly be more in the middle of nowhere
the colts announced they have placed joshua mcnary who they signed as a free agent in april two thousand and thirteen on the exempt commissioner permission list so he will not be allowed to play in the team's upcoming playoff <unk> but he will continue to be paid in accordance with the national football league's updated personal conduct policy
mcnary was released early thursday according to the marion county indiana jail website
he posted a twenty five thousand dollar bond and was ordered to wear an ankle bracelet for gps monitoring said <unk> <unk> a spokeswoman for the county prosecuting attorney
he appeared at an initial hearing at which a preliminary not guilty plea was entered for him she said
his next court date is a march eleven <unk> conference
defense attorney edward <unk> said he would not be commenting further on the case but said in his statement that the charges and affidavit are not evidence of wrongdoing but simply one <unk> story
joshua has full faith and confidence in the american way including its justice system which he pledged to protect and defend as a west point graduate and lieutenant in the united states army
mcnary twenty six was taken into police custody and charged with felony rape felony criminal confinement and misdemeanor battery resulting in bodily injury
according to a probable cause affidavit a twenty nine year old woman reported to police on the morning of december one that she was raped hours earlier at the apartment of a man she met at a bar
the woman recounted having numerous drinks at three establishments before she arrived at the apartment and she didn't remember exactly how she got there the affidavit says
she recalled being <unk> and <unk> <unk> as she and the man kissed she told police
this wasn't a problem and it was not aggressive she said according to the affidavit
soon though she told the man that she needed to lay down because she was really drunk the affidavit says
she lay in the man's bed and he began kissing her which made her uncomfortable and she noticed that he had taken his shirt off and she was completely naked she told police
no
i'm too drunk for this
i need to lay down
i have to work and i'm not ok with this she recalled telling the man according to the affidavit
she said she told the man several times she didn't want to have sex and fought with him scratching him on the face neck back and shoulder
the man initially tried to talk her into it and then forced her to have sex on his bed she told police
she told the man she wanted to leave on multiple occasions but he wouldn't let her at one point saying you're gon na stay the affidavit says
she eventually left the apartment and mistakenly took the man's cell phone with her she told police
a forensic nurse examined the woman and found injuries to her vagina and dried blood behind one ear
the document indicates detectives used the cell phone to identify mcnary the next day
when police arrived to search his apartment he pointed to a pile of <unk> in front of a <unk> and told police i preserved it for you because i knew you would be coming
he had also taken photos of the sheets in particular blood <unk> and other <unk> areas of the <unk> the affidavit says
mcnary was cooperative police indicated and he asked for a lawyer after being advised of his rights
a nurse found <unk> and <unk> on his stomach back neck and shoulder the document says
investigators also found the woman's clothing and an <unk> in <unk> apartment
the colts said they were aware of the incident but that was the limit of our knowledge
the team was working to gather facts before forming an opinion the statement said
colts spokesman <unk> <unk> said that after reviewing documents surrounding the very serious criminal charges the team asked commissioner roger goodell to place mcnary on the exemption list
if the request is granted josh will not be eligible to practice or attend games with the club while designated as commissioner exempt
that designation will permit the investigation provided by the league's personal conduct policy to run its course and will afford josh the opportunity to focus on his defense against the charges the statement said
a later statement confirmed mcnary had been placed on the list
the national football league said the matter is under review
recently the nfl revised its personal conduct policy
it includes a minimum six game suspension for crimes involving violent conduct including domestic violence and sexual assault
the league reviewed its stance after widespread criticism of its handling of the ray rice case
mcnary is listed as a second string inside linebacker for the colts who play the new england patriots on sunday in the afc championship game
he has twenty eight tackles mostly on special teams in fifteen games this season
the six foot two hundred and fifty one pound player is in his second season
he played college football at army and served in the military from two thousand and eleven to two thousand and thirteen before joining the colts
while short of lifting the decades old u.s. embargo on the island a move that would require congressional approval the administration's new rules on travel and trade will likely herald a new era in ties between the two countries
under the <unk> regulations whose details were outlined in more detail thursday americans will be able to visit cuba without first seeking a license from the treasury department so long as the travel meets certain criteria
the new regulations will take effect friday according to the u.s. treasury
president barack obama originally announced the change in u.s. policy on cuba on dec. seventeen as part of a larger deal that secured the release of alan gross an american government subcontractor who was imprisoned on the island for five years
cuban americans traveling to see family members american officials on government trips journalists on assignment on the island as well as every day citizen visiting for educational cultural religious reasons will no longer need permission first
the new regulations allow travel agents and airlines to book tickets for u.s. citizens to cuba without a special license from the treasury department's office of foreign assets control known as <unk>
americans traveling to the island will also be allowed to use credit cards a restriction that complicated trips to cuba in the past
today's announcement takes us one step closer to replacing out of date policies that were not working and puts in place a policy that helps promote political and economic freedom for the cuban people treasury secretary jack lew said in a statement
in unveiling the new regulations the obama administration revealed it is moving to establish a u.s. embassy in havana allowing american officials to make purchases that will revamp u.s. diplomatic facilities that already exist in the cuban capital
commerce secretary penny <unk> is slated to visit cuba later this year
today's actions which are being taken in coordination with the u.s. department of the treasury give legal effect to the historic policy changes that president obama announced <unk> said in a statement
the administration's rules still present challenges for americans traveling to cuba
u.s. <unk> will only be allowed to import up to one hundred dollar in alcohol and tobacco products under the regulations setting a limit on the number of cuban cigars americans will be permitted to bring home
chris chiames <unk> vice president of corporate affairs says the travel booking site expects to have flights to cuba as well as hotel options available to consumers in two thousand and fifteen
we're working through how to turn that on quickly
it's not going to be tomorrow he said adding u.s. citizens should expect travel sometime in two thousand and fifteen
in the short term chiames said it's unlikely travelers will be able to fly on u.s. carriers
the first step appears to be giving consumers the ability to book tickets on international carriers like air canada <unk>
travelers could fly from the u.s. to cities in canada and mexico for example and then make connections to havana
chiames said u.s. carriers are still working through dot to determine how quickly they will be able to offer service from american cities
republicans have blasted obama's move to thaw decades old tensions with cuba
sen. marco rubio said thursday that the new policies will have the effect of <unk> a <unk> without benefiting cubans
this is a <unk> for the castro regime that will be used to fund its <unk> against cubans as well as its activities against u.s. national interests in latin america and beyond he said
given existing u.s. laws about our cuba policy this slew of regulations leave at least one major question president obama and his administration have failed to answer so far
what legal authority does he have to enrich the castro regime in these ways
but at the back end testing blood often requires transporting the <unk> to a clinic a range of laboratory equipment and trained clinicians and doctors to get an accurate result
the whole process can take days and in some cases even weeks
but imagine if you could put the whole laboratory into a portable unit that delivered a reading immediately
one irish company says it has developed the solution a clinic in a box that can test for a range of diseases or medical conditions in minutes from just a single drop of blood
the physicians were crying out for a simple to use device jerry o'brien a farmer's son from <unk> who broke with the family tradition to pursue a career in healthcare told cnn
there was a huge <unk> clinical need
it was very obvious from the start they wanted a simple device that would test for any condition off a finger prick of blood within a matter of minutes
he said a quick look at the antiquated equipment often still used by laboratories immediately told him that there was a better mousetrap to be built
we looked at the gold standard piece of equipment we opened the hood on it and inside there were vacuum tubes technology from the fifty s and sixty s and that was the spark o'brien said
after six years of research and development <unk> <unk> based company <unk> diagnostics came up with its <unk> prototype
cartridges packed with tiny <unk> with a molecular coating specific to the disease that is being investigated are loaded into the machine
a drop of blood is spun with the <unk> and any disease molecules present in the blood sample appear in the form long chains
analyzing these samples under a green light immediately shows how much of the disease is present in the sample
doctors would be equipped with cartridges specific to the diseases they may be diagnosing
from heart or liver disease to diabetes
the device has multiple applications and can be used in remote locations where access to laboratory facilities is limited or even non existent
one of its major investors has been the european space agency who are looking to use the device in space
give the european space agency a device for testing astronauts for testing not only there and then but tracking their physiology over their long stays in space in zero gravity he said
one of the advantages of the system said o'brien is that doctors can reinforce their medical advice with an instant diagnosis
if you can get the diagnostic or monitoring test there and then the physician can look you in the eye and say
you've not been managing your health when you come back in three months time i want to see better test results

the first day of the <unk> abu dhabi championship thursday was nothing but eventful as a top class field <unk> for position at the top of the leader board
most eyes were on the partnership of mcilroy and his american rival fowler <unk> off early at abu dhabi <unk> and they did not disappoint both <unk> five under rounds of sixty seven
but last year's u.s. open champion <unk> a three time winner at the venue later <unk> them with a blistering eight under sixty four which included ten birdies a personal best for him he told the official european tour website
i <unk> well
i made ten birdies
i'm not sure if i have ever done it on a golf course hit ten birdies
i hit a lot of <unk> my <unk> were quite sharp and i <unk> well
it's very difficult to shoot a bad score when you play like this
his late charge denied belgium's thomas <unk> the honor of first day leadership while there was a five strong group on sixty six consisting of <unk> grace gregory <unk> <unk> <unk> alexander levy and <unk> <unk>
mcilroy looking to add to his two majors of last year in two thousand and fifteen made a slow start but a rally on his back nine with five birdies in six holes left him in a challenging position
there was no doubting the shots of the day which came from young gun lewis and the fifty one year old <unk> who <unk> the seventh and fifteen th holes respectively
lewis won a luxury car for his effort while <unk> was left to celebrate the eighth hole in one of his european tour career
it's very nice when you make a hole in one
i'm happy i finished level par today

as they've <unk> out accounts of the bloody attacks on the northern nigerian town of baga and surrounding villages have shocked even those all too used to reports of violence by boko haram militants
witnesses told how the attackers sped into the town on january three with grenade <unk> their gunfire and explosions shattering the early morning calm
some terrified residents fled while others took refuge in their homes and were torched with them
local officials reported death tolls ranging from hundreds to as many as two thousand people
but authorities have yet to access the remote area near the border with chad to get a full picture
amnesty international said that satellite images taken on january two and five days later provide indisputable and shocking evidence of the extent of the destruction in baga and neighboring village of doron baga also known as doro <unk>
the before and after images demonstrate that the attacks left more than three thousand seven hundred structures damaged or destroyed the rights group said
more than three thousand one hundred of those were in doron baga which was nearly wiped off the map it said
other nearby towns and villages in borno state were also targeted in the series of attacks that started on january three
these detailed images show devastation of catastrophic proportions in two towns one of which was almost wiped off the map in the space of four days said daniel <unk> nigeria researcher for amnesty international
of all boko haram assaults <unk> by amnesty international this is the largest and most destructive yet
it represents a deliberate attack on civilians whose homes clinics and schools are now burnt out ruins
many of the wooden fishing boats that can be seen along the <unk> in the images of doron baga from january two are gone in the later images the group said
this agrees with witness accounts of desperate residents fleeing by boat across lake chad
another rights group human rights watch has also published satellite imagery that it said showed the results of fires set by boko haram
the rights group said eleven percents of baga and fifty seven percents of doro <unk> were scarred by the flames
asked by cnn about the amnesty satellite images mike omeri coordinator of nigeria's national information center said this is a government that analyzes any and all sources of information
amnesty international last week described the massacre as possibly boko haram's deadliest act yet
the nigerian military said that description was quite valid
the attack on the town by the <unk> and their activities since january three should convince well meaning people all over the world that boko haram is the evil all must collaborate to end it said
nigeria's government has called for boko haram to be seen as a problem requiring a concerted international response as seen after the terrorist attacks in paris last week
on wednesday a new message surfaced from boko haram's leader abubakar shekau in which he praised again and again the deadly rampage at the charlie hebdo offices in france
nigeria has always said this is a global challenge and viewed as such requires global military action said omeri
the combatants we capture are often not even nigerian
they don't even speak our languages
what started as copycat attacks is now a newly devised network
the government has come under fire from critics who say president goodluck jonathan is more interested in campaigning for the presidential election next month than in dealing with the problem of boko haram
soldiers who spoke to cnn in northern nigeria painted a troubling picture when asked about their efforts to take on the islamist extremist group
they said boko haram <unk> and outnumbered the military on the battlefield
while the militants are equipped with anti aircraft guns on the backs of trucks that have a range of three quarters of a mile they have only ak forty seven weapons with a range of a few hundred yards the soldiers said
adding to their difficulties they are issued only sixty bullets when they go into battle they said while the boko haram fighters have many more
many soldiers also have to buy their own uniforms and lack protective gear they said
morale is low and this is one of the reasons that boko haram is making gains on the battlefield they said
responding to the claims that the military is <unk> omeri said
nigeria is in the process of acquiring new equipment and we will continue to intensify those efforts
in a rare piece of good news nigerian soldiers thwarted a boko haram attack wednesday in the town of biu in southern borno state the military said
the nigerian defense headquarters said five terrorists and two anti aircraft guns were captured
officials gave no casualty tolls but residents told cnn that at least forty boko haram fighters were killed when nigerian soldiers surprised them and fought a lengthy gun battle
omeri said we've always said this is an ongoing process
we're happy that this success has come in quick succession to baga
we hope more will be achieved
the continuing violence has displaced many people from their homes
of the thirty thousand people displaced during the attacks around baga twenty thousand camped in maiduguri city capital of borno state while another ten thousand headed to monguno town nearer baga
others were stranded on <unk> island on lake chad
these people are adding to the hundreds of thousands of internally displaced people and refugees who have already stretched the capacity of host communities and government authorities amnesty international said
amnesty international is calling on the governments of nigeria and chad to ensure these displaced people are protected and provided with adequate humanitarian assistance
boko haram has terrorized northern nigeria regularly since two thousand and nine attacking police schools churches and civilians and bombing government buildings
it has also kidnapped students including more than two hundred schoolgirls who were abducted in april and remain missing
the islamist group has said its aim is to impose a stricter form of sharia law across nigeria which is split between a majority muslim north and a mostly christian south

we should have sent someone with a higher profile
when the sound of gunfire rattled out of the offices of charlie hebdo in paris it looked like the systematic murder of cartoonists and staff at the satirical magazine could have been the work of lone wolf extremists two brothers named said and cherif kouachi
when a policewoman was gunned down the next day police first thought the incident was unrelated
but when that gunman amedy coulibaly took hostages at a kosher supermarket the next day demanding that police stand down from a siege of the kouachi brothers happening just outside the city a web of connections started to become clear
and as investigators look into the horrific events that shook france and the world this month it becomes clear that the links spread from paris out to yemen syria iraq and beyond
a week after the charlie hebdo killings al qaeda's yemen affiliate al qaeda in the arabian peninsula said that it had planned and funded the attack years earlier
in a video message aqap credited the american born radical preacher anwar al awlaki with giving the orders before he was killed in two thousand and eleven
separately a video emerged that appeared to show coulibaly pledging allegiance to the leader of another terror group abu bakr al baghdadi the self proclaimed caliph of the islamic state in iraq and syria
through legal papers jihadi websites press reports and its own investigations cnn has <unk> together other connections
when they were in their twenty s the kouachi brothers were part of a circle of parisian islamists inspired by farid <unk> police allege in court papers seen by cnn
later cherif kouachi was in jail with djamel beghal who was accused of being a top al qaeda recruiter
coulibaly and his wife hayat boumeddiene often visited beghal when he got out of prison as did kouachi
both kouachi brothers and coulibaly are dead but boumeddiene is on the run and investigators are continuing to look into who knows whom and what the connections could reveal
that's according to a new model appearing in the latest issue of the scientific journal plos
the authors predict that ebola could be contained in liberia between march and june of this year with a rapid decline in new cases following june two thousand and fifteen
the paper does caution that continuing on the path to elimination will require sustained <unk> and individual willingness to be treated and experts were careful to point out that this hopeful news is only possible if the current rate of hospitalization continues and the same careful protocols are followed both in the hospitals and out in the community
liberia along with guinea and sierra leone is one of the three countries hit hardest by this epidemic
it was serious enough to be labeled a public health emergency of international concern by the world health organization
according to the latest figures from who there have been at least eight thousand three hundred and thirty one ebola cases involving liberian citizens and three thousand five hundred and thirty eight deaths since the start of the epidemic
that's with forty eight new cases in just the past twenty one days
out of control
how the world reacted as ebola spread
who officials confirm that the number of cases in liberia has been slowing significantly recently <unk> every three weeks on average
last week fewer than ten cases were reported nationwide
since the epidemic started a little more than a year ago in a remote village in guinea the world has seen over twenty one thousand people infected and over eight thousand four hundred deaths according to the latest who numbers
and those numbers are believed to be low since there was widespread under reporting of cases according to who
ebola everything you need to know
no matter what the numbers the virus has a high fatality rate in africa seventy percents by some <unk>
of the three countries hit hardest liberia has had the most success containing the epidemic
initially the country saw some of the fastest epidemic growth but it ramped up hospital capacity in late august two thousand and fourteen according to the new study and it continued to add spaces to care for patients
liberia also rapidly moved to safer burial practices practices which according to experts had caused the rate of infection to increase
i am liberian i'm always confident about the future
in an email to cnn who said this model is enormously encouraging but we emphasize that the job is not done until we are sure there are no remaining infections in the human population
going abroad
here are ten diseases to watch out for
a report from the cdc last september estimated there could have been more than half a million cases by january with a total number of cases going up to one point four million without proper precautions and protocols
that estimate used older data failed to account for the international commitment of troops and extra medical equipment to fight the epidemic
sierra leone which has been hit hardest by the epidemic has at least ten thousand one hundred and twenty four cases and three thousand and sixty two deaths according to figures from january eleven
guinea where this epidemic started has had at least two thousand eight hundred and six cases and one thousand eight hundred and fourteen deaths
sierra leone is still trying to scale up their response to ebola according to tom frieden director of the centers for disease control
he also said that as the infection rate slowed down briefly health care workers were relaxing their grip by not wearing protective clothing and not taking enough precautions
speaking to reporters after his recent visit to liberia guinea and sierra leone frieden said he saw real momentum and real progress in combating the virus but he added it's going to be a long hard fight
the challenge he said
is not to let up not to be complacent and to really double down
in one thousand nine hundred and ninety one four year old sun bin was taken by child traffickers from his hometown in sichuan province and sold to a family thousands of miles away in jiangsu province on the country's eastern coast chinese state media reported
on tuesday sun was finally <unk> with his sixty year old father sun youhong and a younger sister he had never met
the moment was captured in a moving series of photographs
i was happy
i was grateful the father said
but i was also bitter
child trafficking is still a major business in china as traffickers seek to profit off a growing demand for healthy babies from potential adoptive parents in china and elsewhere
boys prized because they carry on the family line are in great demand and fetch higher prices
earlier this week chinese police said they had rescued thirty seven newborn babies after busting a trafficking ring that sold the babies for up thirteen thousand dollar each
the reunion tuesday took place at a police station in <unk>
when a police officer introduced sun bin to his father the twenty eight year old dropped to his knees and wept in his father's embrace
you're a man
don't cry said the elder sun according to a report released by the state news agency xinhua
sun bin was just a toddler when he disappeared at a vegetable market in one thousand nine hundred and ninety one
sun youhong said that he and his wife had dropped everything to search for him
he said they posted search notices around the area and sun <unk> mother traveled to other cities in sichuan and neighboring provinces
sun <unk> mother was diagnosed with cancer in one thousand nine hundred and ninety six and died in two thousand and eleven
to find our son had been my wife's biggest wish in life sun youhong told xinhua earlier this week
and days before she passed away she was constantly <unk> our son's name
sun bin told chinese journalists he had always thought he was adopted but he didn't know where his original home was
he said he had never asked his adoptive parents how he ended up with them
as he grew older he said his wish to find his own family had become stronger and stronger
he left a dna sample with a local police station in jiangsu in october two thousand and fourteen and recently received a phone call saying that a match had been found
the family also received assistance from a chinese web site called baby come home which helps reunite separated relatives
the elder sun said he was disappointed to learn that his missing child had been put to work as an <unk> when he was still a teenager
i would have kept my son in school at the age of fifteen he said
in a phone interview with cnn the father accused his son's adoptive parents of breaking the law for accepting a kidnapped child
but as long as my son comes back to live with me i won't press charges against them he added
sun bin has yet to make a decision of whether he will leave the adoptive coastal town where he was raised
for now he is sleeping for the first time in twenty four years in the home of his biological father
but sacra recovered from the virus he contracted in august and thursday he is headed back to liberia
he calls the west african nation his second home
he lived there from one thousand nine hundred and ninety five to two thousand and ten and has made about a dozen trips since then
but he said this time he'll have a different perspective
having spent three days in the treatment unit in liberia i really feel for those who are sick sacra said from his home in holden massachusetts
the third american to contract ebola sacra remembers the <unk> liberian hospital with the uncomfortably thin <unk> and the ever present strong smell of bleach
because doctors and nurses had to suit up in protective care they only came around to see patients every three hours so if he needed something he had to wait
you spend a lot of time alone and lonely he said
sacra said he hopes this makes him a better doctor
i think it makes me more sensitive to where people are coming from and how they might be feeling and why they might be discouraged he said
sacra was evacuated from liberia to nebraska medical center in omaha one of four hospitals in the united states with a biocontainment unit where he received a blood transfusion from dr. kent brantly another american ebola survivor and the experimental drug tkm ebola
i never felt like i was not going to make it he said when he was released from the hospital on september twenty five
this upcoming trip will be easier than his august trip in one big way
he won't have to worry about contracting ebola because he's now immune to the strain of the disease responsible for the current epidemic
but it will be more difficult in another way
he knows many of his friends in liberia lost family members and colleagues to ebola this fall and he won't be able to comfort them with a hug because hugging or even shaking hands is forbidden in order to cut down on the spread of the disease
he said now that the number of ebola patients in liberia has gone down dramatically he's not needed to work in the ebola ward
instead he'll be involved in evaluating and <unk> patients who come into the elwa hospital run by sim a christian missionary group
he hopes to return to his regular schedule of working four weeks in liberia every three months
he said he misses the food potato greens palm butter and peanut soup and he misses his friends and colleagues
he also hopes his trip reminds the rest of the world that ebola and many other diseases are still a huge threat in west africa
the needs in liberia are still tremendous he said
even before ebola the health care system was very weak and barely functioning
i just feel that god has opened the door for me to make a difference
i was to continue doing that if i can

most muslims do not become muslims to <unk> in murder and mayhem <unk> abdul <unk> the leading point scorer in nba history told cnn's world sport on wednesday
it's not what islam is about
we try to live lives of peace and harmony within ourselves and with our neighbors
abdul <unk> also a best selling author who was in london promoting a pair of new books including a fictional work about sherlock holmes brother was speaking a week after brothers said and cherif kouachi killed twelve people at the french satirical magazine
french media reported that the gunmen yelled we have <unk> the prophet while carrying out the attack referring to the prophet mohammed
amedy coulibaly who reportedly had ties to the brothers killed four hostages at a kosher grocery store two days later
abdul <unk> in a column for the website of time magazine last week said he was looking forward to the day when these terrorists praising the prophet or <unk> name as they <unk> their actual teachings are instantly recognized as <unk> <unk> themselves as muslims
he added to cnn that poverty or lack of opportunities in education are factors in people committing such acts
they become radicalized by the lack of opportunity and anything in their future that has any promise he said
they embrace violence
they try to use religion as something to justify that
but nothing justifies that
as someone who was in the public eye through sports abdul <unk> feels sports can play a role in bringing people from different backgrounds together
sport absolutely plays a part in that he said
when you spend all of your time trying to develop the talent for a sport and you see people doing the same thing from a different culture and you have the same interests there's common ground there
and you can go from that to find more common ground
i think sport has gone a great way to doing that
look at the u.s. china relationship ping pong was the thing that opened the door
a sporting event
but abdul <unk> also said it was down to the media to understand islam better
i'd just like to see a better understanding by the media as to what islam is all about as opposed to what the terrorists say it's about he continued
i think that is the key issue here
once those things get cleared up i think we can make some progress

thrust into the spotlight at the two thousand and seven women's world cup the perennial reserve goalkeeper put in a <unk> performance going <unk> for a world record five hundred and forty minutes during germany's victorious campaign that year
in keeping a clean sheet for all six matches at the tournament in china angerer became the first goalkeeper male or female to play an entire world cup finals without conceding a goal
the whole tournament i wasn't thinking about it because i was so much under pressure
i was just focusing on not making any mistakes angerer told cnn's human to hero series
but after the world cup it was like
ok cool i broke this record
but it's not that important for me
i'm more proud that we won the world cup as a team
the feat was even more impressive given germany's opposition in the final a brazil side which had torn apart opposition defenses scoring seventeen goals en route to the final
but they couldn't find a way past angerer who repelled everything that came her way including a penalty from the south <unk> star striker <unk>
as a goalkeeper you are always happy when you save a penalty but it was a special one because we were leading one zero
it was the final and world star <unk> shooting a penalty against a nobody goalkeeper
it makes me proud
it was an important save
it was the <unk> moment that helped launch <unk> career finally allowing her to take over from <unk> <unk> the veteran who had dominated german <unk> since the early one thousand nine hundred and ninety s
it was destiny angerer says
it was not the easiest way but it was good way sitting on the bench you learn get experience and it was a good life lesson as well
born in <unk> a
main a town near <unk> angerer grew up playing football with the boys in the neighborhood before making her mark at junior level for the local <unk> <unk> girls side
but back then she was more interested in wearing the no
nine rather than the no
one shirt
i never wanted to be a goalkeeper i wanted to be a forward and until under sixteen i was a forward
after playing in goal in a regional trial match angerer was encouraged to keep putting on the gloves
when i was fifteen i started to train as a goalkeeper and very fast and two years later i got my first cap for the team
a handful of appearances followed before she settled into her role as reserve to <unk>
it was a situation that suited her just fine at the time
i wasn't really mature when i was seventeen
i said to myself
oh that's easy because i was always very athletic and didn't need to train i was still much better than all the others she recalls of her attitude when she was younger
this relaxed outlook extended to her social life when she started her club career at bayern munich angerer would spend her days organizing her back four and her nights arranging to go to parties
i moved out of home and moved to munich by myself my own flat
i enjoyed the night life the party stuff
but <unk> more mature approach she really trained hard angerer says would eventually rub off and when the veteran keeper injured her knee just weeks before the two thousand and seven world cup angerer was prepared
i was waiting ten years and i'd developed so much as a goalkeeper
i trained so hard and i wanted to be the no
one
it was now my time to show it
further triumphs followed at the women's european championships in both two thousand and nine and two thousand and thirteen where she <unk> her penalty saving <unk> not once but twice in the final against norway
it was germany's sixth successive euro triumph in all but it was in many ways her finest moment as she <unk> a severely depleted german team to glory
before the european championships seven players from our normal line up got injured
and so we had to replace with some very very young players
i think our average age was twenty two twenty three she explains
this was the tournament which showed me what you can achieve if you have a good team spirit we definitely weren't the best team at that tournament
but we won it because we were a team and that made me so proud
this was actually the most important tournament i ever played
her outstanding individual performance and leadership skills didn't go unnoticed by the wider football community who voted angerer the world women's player of the year in two thousand and thirteen at fifa's annual ballon d'or ceremony in january last year
real madrid and portugal star cristiano ronaldo may have taken all the headlines picking up his second best player award but once again angerer was quietly celebrating another first she is the only goalkeeper male or female to win the award
angerer has enjoyed successful stints at german clubs winning the <unk> twice and a uefa women's champions league with turbine <unk> and <unk> the <unk> <unk> cup with <unk> in two thousand and eleven
since two thousand and thirteen she has divided her time between the u.s. and australia playing for the portland <unk> in the u.s. national women's soccer league and on loan at the brisbane <unk> in the australian w league
the experience of playing abroad particularly in the u.s. has helped her game evolve she says
it was a perfect experience for me to go to the u.s. and adjust to a new system and a new way of playing soccer
i learned so many new things
it's totally different compared to the game in europe she says
my <unk> coach from the national team and my head coach were both like
wow
you've developed so much
that makes me proud as well
that's also my motivation that i always have the feeling to keep getting better and better
even if i'm quite old
watching her dive around <unk> on the brisbane turf it's easy to <unk> angerer carrying on for several more years at the top level
one day she hopes to coach the next generation of keepers but it seems that can be saved for later
i'm thirty six and i feel better than ever so there's no reason to quit
why should i
i feel good i'm fit and most importantly i like what i'm doing
loose stones tumble from the tops of the walls far up on the hilltop
all around me tree limbs shake
it's just after dawn and i'm alone climbing the trail to the fifteen th century royal compound on the hilltop at great zimbabwe in southern africa
alone except for the <unk>
like all the stone structures here the <unk> is open to the sky but the incline is so steep and the curves so sharp that i can't see more than ten feet in front of me
sure enough around the next bend a <unk> is waiting for me on one of the dozens of <unk> that skirt the hillside
we watch each other for a few moments until i'm certain he's not interested in me and then i keep walking
<unk> freak me out but these moments are part of what makes great zimbabwe such an incredible place to visit
unlike the world's more visited ruins which is basically every other ruin here it's easy to lose yourself in the mystery of the place even if that means the occasional standoff with a <unk>
the <unk> leads to a narrow passage through a <unk> in the rocky hilltop
stone walls that form the perimeter of the royal complex tower overhead
they once would've extended even farther out over the stairs but a terrace collapsed since the city was abandoned bringing a wall down with it
it's hard to find a vantage point to see the entire complex
the old city which was the capital of a trading empire and home to ten thousand people in the one thousand four hundred s stretches over one thousand eight hundred acres
essentially the hilltop <unk> as a palace and cathedral the center of political and religious power
on the planes below circular stone walls form a series of <unk>
the most iconic <unk> called the great <unk> is the largest pre colonial structure south of the sahara
the walls rise up thirty six feet and stretch eight hundred and twenty feet around
at one end an inner wall forms a narrow passage that leads to a <unk> tower the most distinctive landmark in the old city
i like the hill complex more
here the walls curve around each other and the granite <unk> which are incorporated into the design
different chambers are linked by a <unk> of narrow passages that snake up and down over the giant rocks
at the far side is a chamber with a towering stone <unk> that once held a small stone wall that acted like a <unk>
like all the structures here the stones were assembled without mortar
each layer was slightly recessed creating a slope that held it all together
over the centuries some walls were knocked down by treasure hunters or just by the elements
the chamber below is where a famous set of carved birds were found
most of them are now housed in a small museum inside the park which is worth a visit if only to see them
the image of a bird appears on the national flag and is as much a symbol of <unk> national identity as the statue of liberty is to the united states
there's a good chance of being here alone
visitors might see schoolchildren passing through on their way to class or the occasional park worker but not many other visitors
tourism in zimbabwe has been in a long and slow recovery
in the one thousand nine hundred and ninety s zimbabwe was for a moment the most visited country in sub saharan africa
by the time the nation hit rock bottom in two thousand and eight hardly any foreign visitors came
now major attractions like victoria falls are bouncing back but places like great zimbabwe have fallen far off the radar
the ruins are easily accessible by road but it takes several hours from <unk> or a full day from johannesburg so not many people make the effort
but this is a place i love returning to
in the colonial days when zimbabwe was known as <unk> white families used to vacation here and remnants of those days remain
the national park has simple <unk> <unk> for hire and there's the dated but charming great zimbabwe hotel just outside the gates as well as the <unk> safari style lodge at the ancient city
the <unk> restaurant where the buffet is designed like the stone walls serves lucky travelers fresh <unk> from the nearby dam
if not there's almost always a fisherman selling his catch on the roadside which can be grilled outdoors or ask the restaurant to prepare it
on my latest trip i went with an <unk> organized by the <unk> school of arts at the university of the <unk> in johannesburg
those going on their own can hire a guide on site
every guide i've ever had here has been articulate and charming and well informed but it's even more amazing to spend a few days exploring the ruins with people who actually wrote the book on great zimbabwe
you can find their offerings at <unk> under history of art
practical tips
zimbabwe has started an online visa system which isn't working at the time of this writing
when it does applying online will get visitors a letter that they must present on arrival which is when the visa is actually issued
those that require a visa might be better off simply getting it on arrival
anyone driving up from south africa can save themselves a lot of hassle at the border by contacting the zimbabwe tourism authority ahead of time
they can arrange to have an officer to wait at the border post and walk visitors through the immigration and customs process
this can save hours and endless headaches
and it's a free service
when that time comes a sigh of relief as <unk> empty out the full bag onto the deck
stepping forward are <unk> anderson a cell biologist and robert johansen a marine biologist
the pile of dirt sea sponges and starfish from the ocean floor are what they came all this way for
above the arctic circle in the <unk> <unk> of northern norway researchers on the helmer hanssen are searching for the next generation of antibiotics
in these sea organisms they hope are new bacteria to become those drugs
if no one finds new antibiotics for common infections what will happen is we will go back to the pre antibiotic age in which a simple cut could turn into an infection that becomes deadly said marcel jaspars
jaspars is the founder of the pharmasea project an eu funded initiative to bring research groups together around the world in search of new antibiotics
the world health organization says antibiotic resistance is a growing health crisis around the world calling it an increasingly serious threat to global public health that requires action across all government sectors and society
it is not cost effective for pharmaceutical companies to search for new antibiotics
on average it costs a pharmaceutical company more than two billion dollar to bring a new drug to market
in the case of antibiotics the drug is only taken for a short time and could eventually develop resistance
that's why large scale focus has moved away from antibiotics research in the past thirty years
in the meantime bacteria have evolved adapted and become resistant to many current antibiotics
what was once common treatments are no longer treatable by using standard antibiotics jaspars said
the key is finding new chemistry
bacteria can't be resistant to a drug if they've never seen anything like it before
extreme environments are providing new places to look
in the past bacteria and <unk> have been the main sources for new antibiotics jaspars explained
in fact about seventy percents of our antibiotics still come from nature normally from sediment samples and soil samples from land
but now by looking at the ocean we hope to find new life forms which give us new chemistry that might be able to treat bacterial infections
that's exactly why anderson and johansen are on board the helmer hanssen
they are part of jaspars pharmasea team and they have identified the icy waters of the norwegian arctic as a potential breeding ground of new bacteria
in this extreme environment the sea organisms have been forced to adapt over time
they have to adjust for very different temperatures as compared to other parts of the world anderson said
we think that since they are living in an extreme environment they have developed some extreme strategies to survive
anderson and johansen take their finds from the bottom of the sea straight to a wet lab on the ship
it is critical to begin testing as soon as possible ensuring <unk> of the organisms
johansen cuts open the starfish while anderson makes solutions to be <unk> on a petri dish
in a few weeks bacteria will grow on the plates hopefully exhibiting antibacterial properties
it is a long and tedious process with no time to waste
it often takes upwards of a decade for new drugs to be approved
it's a rush against time anderson said
i think we have to speed up the process of trying to find novel antibiotics
at the moment a lot of the antibiotics out there are working in the same way
the early results are promising
several compounds being tested in norway and at jaspars lab in scotland are showing initial signs of antibacterial properties
a good start with a long way to go but jaspars knows the hopeful legacy of the pharmasea project and others like is around the world is to eradicate the issue of antibiotic resistance
who knows where the next <unk> will be found
perhaps it will be in the icy norwegian arctic
it is always very exciting when you get to the stage where you are the first person to see a bacteria said jaspars or the first person to identify the structure of a new molecule that has the potential at that moment to be a treatment for a difficult disease
using the <unk> hashtag tech lovers and entrepreneurs joined special guests rebecca <unk> founder of <unk> <unk> <unk> executive director of <unk> inc and <unk> ceo erik <unk> for a lively debate
if you were unable to join us here's what you missed
we started with a question encouraging our tech entrepreneurs to think back to when they began
tech lovers around the world also got involved in the chat using the hashtag <unk>
the second question looked at the most usual mistakes young entrepreneurs do
choosing a great team is an integral part of building a thriving business so we asked our guests what they looked for in potential recruits
of course a chat about startups couldn't go on without tackling the issue of raising money
being transparent and passionate seemed to be the key advice from our experts and other participants
the discussion then tackled the topic of selling early or holding out for a bigger exit
entrepreneur <unk> <unk> founder of beni american university in nigeria shared some practical and level headed advice
our next question was about the importance of mentors and the qualities they can bring to a business
pr guru <unk> <unk> shared what she thinks a good mentor is
in question seven we moved on to the topic of effective press coverage
we then asked our guests whether entrepreneurs should join a tech incubator and what they should consider in advance
wrapping up our <unk> chat we asked our guests what was the best thing about working in africa's tech sector
the chat provided businesses with the vital tools and inspiration they need to grow their tech startups
what made us laugh the most is that the bells of notre dame rang in our honor
for a week now charlie has been moving far more than mountains across the world
for a week now as <unk> has shown us so <unk> in his drawing charlie has many new friends
some anonymous and some global celebrities
some humble and some affluent
some <unk> and some religious leaders
some sincere and some akin to <unk>
some who will be with us for the rest of our lives and some who are just passing by
we take them all on board today we have neither the time nor the heart to separate them out
but that doesn't mean that we are fooled
we wholeheartedly thank those in their millions whether simple citizens or <unk> institutions who are truly at our sides who deeply and sincerely are charlie
they will know who they are
<unk> off the others who don't give a <unk> anyway
there is however a question which still <unk> away at us
are we finally going to see the foul expression secular fundamentalist disappear from political and intellectual <unk>
are we finally going to stop <unk> learned <unk> expressions describing equally assassins and their victims
in recent years we have felt rather lonely trying to push back with our <unk> straightforward <unk> and <unk> intellectual <unk> that they were throwing at our faces and that of our friends who were strongly defending secularism
<unk> <unk> <unk> people assuming no responsibility those who throw oil on the fire <unk> you asked for it
yes we condemn terrorism but
yes it is not good to threaten cartoonists with death but
yes setting fire to a magazine's headquarters is wrong but
we've heard it all as have our friends
we've often tried to laugh it off because that's what we're best at
but now really we'd like to laugh at something else

we were already hearing here and there these delicate people put on airs and <unk> on witnessing last sunday's gathering <unk> endless <unk> seeking to justify openly or in whispers terrorism and religious fascism expressing indignation at the fact that we can say police equals ss among other things
no in this massacre no one death is less unjust than another
franck who died in <unk> premises and all his police colleagues killed during this barbaric week died to defend ideas which may not even have been their own
nevertheless we are going to try to be optimistic even though it is out of season
we will hope that as of this january seven two thousand and fifteen strongly defending secularism will be second nature for everyone
that we will finally stop posturing for electoral reasons or through <unk> <unk> or even <unk> community <unk> and cultural <unk> which lead to but one thing
religious <unk>
yes the israeli palestinian conflict is a fact yes international geopolitics is a succession of maneuvers and <unk> blows yes the social situation of populations of islamic origin in france as people say is deeply unjust yes we must fight <unk> against racism and all types of discrimination
fortunately there are several instruments with which we can try to solve these serious problems but they are all <unk> if one of them is missing
secularism
not affirmative secularism not inclusive secularism not i don't know what kind of secularism
secularism full stop
pushing for universal rights it alone allows for equality liberty brotherhood and <unk>
it alone allows for total freedom of conscience which all religions as soon as they move from the arena of the strictly intimate into the political arena deny more or less openly according to their marketing position
oddly enough it alone allows believers and others to live in peace
all those who claim to defend muslims while accepting the totalitarian religious rhetoric are in fact defending their <unk>
the first victims of islamic fascism are the muslims
the millions of anonymous people all the institutions all the heads of state and government all the political intellectual and media celebrities all the religious dignitaries who this week proclaimed je suis charlie should know that also means i am secularism
we are convinced that as far as most of our supporters are concerned that goes without saying
the others can do what they like with it
last but not least
we would like to send a message to pope francis who this week he as well is charlie
we will only accept that the bells of notre dame are ringing in our honor when it is the <unk> who are ringing them

three million copies of charlie hebdo's first edition since the terrorist attacks flew off <unk> racks wednesday
another million or so went on sale thursday
the cover features a cartoon of the prophet mohammed crying as he holds a sign saying je suis charlie or i am charlie beneath the headline all is forgiven
this run of the magazine could reach five million copies
some have criticized the magazine's decision to depict mohammed however since this is deeply offensive to many muslims
the government of jordan condemned the move thursday saying that continuing to publish offensive drawings of mohammed would hurt the feelings of the muslim communities everywhere
this irresponsible act does not represent the freedom of expression which is based on the foundation of the responsibility and the respect of religions its statement added
freedom of expression is a right but there are limits when it comes to insulting faiths pope francis told reporters thursday referring to events surrounding the charlie hebdo attacks
one can not provoke one can not insult other people's faith one can not make fun of faith francis said on a flight from <unk> sri lanka to the philippines
likewise he said people have religious liberty but one can't kill in the name of god

pakistan's national assembly on thursday unanimously passed a resolution condemning the publication of a caricature of the prophet mohammed by charlie hebdo pakistan's dawn news reported
the resolution also calls on the european union the united nations community and the organization of islamic cooperation take steps to prevent the publishing of such material according to the report
pakistan joins other predominantly muslim countries whose leaders have spoken out against charlie hebdo for its latest publication
prime minister muhammad nawaz sharif said that freedom of speech should not be used to hurt the religious sentiments of any community and that the world should discourage the publication of provocative material

magazine staffers and contributors were gathered for an editorial meeting when authorities said brothers said and cherif kouachi burst into the newsroom and gunned down staffers killing twelve and wounding eleven
one positive story emerged from friday's deadly siege at a kosher grocery store in paris just two days after the charlie hebdo rampage
it was that of lassana bathily a malian muslim immigrant and supermarket employee who said he helped some hostages into a walk in freezer at the store while it was under attack
on thursday french interior minister bernard cazeneuve said france would grant him french citizenship according to a statement
the french government expedited bathily's application which he filed in july two thousand and fourteen
cazeneuve himself will conduct the citizenship ceremony on january twenty

al qaeda in the arabian peninsula claimed responsibility wednesday for <unk> hebdo shooting
the attack was years in the making aqap commander nasr ibn ali al ansi said in a video claiming u.s. born cleric anwar al awlaki was the mastermind behind it
al awlaki was the terror group's spokesman before a u.s. drone strike killed him in yemen in two thousand and eleven
for days intelligence analysts have been trying to piece together whether the kouachi brothers the gunmen who attacked the magazine met him on trips to yemen a theory that could be bolstered by the new video's claim
what is al qaeda in the arabian peninsula
al ansi praised the magazine attack saying it was revenge for charlie hebdo's depictions of mohammed
u.s. authorities said they think the video is authentic
but they weren't ready to say that aqap helped carry out the assault
aqap did not claim responsibility for the kosher grocery store siege but praised it
it was a blessing from allah that the store siege in which four hostages were killed took place about the same time al ansi said
french security services have identified a suspected accomplice in that attack according to the french newspaper le parisien
police sources cited by the newspaper said one line of investigation is that the accomplice a man from a paris suburb may have driven gunman amedy coulibaly to the kosher supermarket where coulibaly later shot dead four people
coulibaly was killed in a police raid to end the siege
the kouachi brothers also are dead
but investigators efforts to track down possible suspects tied to last week's attacks are continuing
le <unk> report said investigators identified coulibaly's suspected accomplice using keys for a motorbike discovered in an apartment they raided over the weekend
neighbors told cnn the apartment in the paris suburb of gentilly was raided saturday by police
also found inside the apartment according to le parisien
a <unk> of weapons explosives and two isis flags
coulibaly purportedly told authorities before he was killed that he belonged to isis
police also think the suspected accomplice may have been responsible for shooting and wounding a jogger last week an attack that the paris prosecutor has said could be tied to coulibaly because the ammunition used was the same as ammunition found at the scene of the kosher market attack le parisien said
paris police would not comment to cnn on the contents of the report
le parisien says coulibaly's suspected accomplice whom the newspaper did not name may have fled france possibly for syria
officials have also said they believe hayat boumeddiene coulibaly's widow may have played a role in the attacks and has fled to syria
coulibaly and boumeddiene drove from france to madrid on december thirty one a spanish source close to the nation's security sources told cnn
coulibaly remained until january two when he returned to france while boumeddiene flew that same day from madrid to istanbul the source said
spanish security authorities are investigating what coulibaly and boumeddiene did while in madrid and are trying to determine where they stayed whom they had contact with and whether they had any support in spain
<unk> <unk> a reporter for <unk> a turkish newspaper said that on january five two days before the charlie hebdo attack police searched the hotel where boumeddiene stayed in <unk> istanbul
police took all the digital registration records on the hotel's computer including video recordings within the hotel
belgian federal prosecutors told cnn on thursday that a man is under arrest in charleroi in connection with arms trafficking
they said he recently bought a car from boumeddiene
prosecutors said the man was known to police but couldn't be directly linked to coulibaly
according to belgian media the man went to police after learning about last week's shootings
they then searched his house and found documents that matched the type of gun coulibaly used in paris
cnn has not been able to independently confirm the details of the raid on the man's home or the documents found after contacting police
u.s. officials have told cnn it's believed that when cherif kouachi traveled to yemen in two thousand and eleven he returned carrying money from aqap earmarked to carry out the attack
investigators said the terrorist group could have given as much as twenty thousand dollar but the exact amount has not been verified
french newspaper la <unk> du <unk> reports that coulibaly also secured funds that may have been used in the attack on the kosher supermarket
he got the loan for seven thousand dollar from the <unk> bank in <unk> <unk> in northern france
the paper reported the amount that coulibaly borrowed was not high enough to require an explanation of how the money would be spent
he took out the loan in december
u.s. president barack obama and uk prime minister david cameron are expected to discuss the paris attacks when they meet thursday and friday in washington

more than two weeks after the plane went down searchers located the majority of flight qz eight thousand five hundred and one's fuselage on wednesday indonesia's search and rescue agency said
the discovery made using a remotely operated underwater vehicle has raised the prospect that many of the bodies of the one hundred and sixty two people aboard the flight could soon be found
search teams have recovered fifty bodies from the sea in the aftermath of the crash some of them still strapped into seats
officials have said many of the more than one hundred passengers and crew members who still aren't accounted for may be inside the fuselage
divers were sent to start looking for bodies in the wreckage thursday
if the bodies are still intact they will be evacuated one by one said supriyadi an operations coordinator for indonesia's search and rescue agency who goes by only one name
but the divers work has been hampered by strong currents that have reduced visibility at the site supriyadi said according to indonesia's national news agency <unk>
if the divers efforts prove unsuccessful crews may lift the fuselage out of the water according to bambang soelistyo the head of the search and rescue agency
nunung said that recovering her brother's body from the wreckage would be better than not finding his body at all
after the plane went missing nunung initially went to the city of surabaya where flight qz eight thousand five hundred and one began its journey to wait for news of her brother
but she later returned to her home in <unk> a city one thousand five hundred kilometers away from surabaya on a different indonesian island
we the family members do not hold any religious rituals together instead we individually pray to god for his best decision for us all she said
investigators are analyzing the contents of flight qz eight thousand five hundred and one's flight recorders which were recovered from the sea earlier in the week
the two devices the flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder are likely to help them figure out what went wrong on the plane as it was flying toward singapore on december twenty eight
officials say a preliminary report should be released within a month of the crash
but it's unclear how much information the initial document will contain beyond what's already been made public
the final report containing investigators full conclusions is expected to take many more months to complete
nunung said she will nonetheless keep monitoring the situation because i want to know why the plane my brother was on crashed

on wednesday agents arrested the cincinnati man before he could put his alleged plot into action
authorities say cornell who ostensibly tweeted under the name raheel <unk> <unk> <unk> a simple scheme
it was similar to the paris attack on the offices of charlie hebdo but at a key location the u.s. capitol said a criminal complaint filed by an fbi agent
the plan
set off pipe bombs to put lawmakers and employees in panicked flight and then gun them down with an assault rifle as they ran across his path and that of an accomplice special agent <unk>
<unk> wrote
cornell was ready to go the agent said
he had made preparations with a partner
he had researched bomb making instructions and by wednesday cornell had bought two m fifteen rifles with six hundred rounds of ammunition
but the man cornell believed was his partner was actually an fbi informant a man in trouble with the law who worked with the agency to improve his legal standing
when they found out cornell had the weapons authorities made their move before cornell could make his
a law enforcement official told cnn that there was never any danger to lawmakers
around lunchtime more than a dozen agents and local police stood at his parents house where he had lived
we heard a pound on the door john cornell lee <unk> father told cnn's anderson cooper
had he not opened it they would have battered it in with a ram he said
he had no idea why they were there and the officers wouldn't tell him he said
they just told us they had a search warrant
they took the whole family in for questioning
where is my son
what is he being charged with
john cornell wanted to know
they wouldn't tell us anything he said
in the fall the informant told the fbi about someone he had been in touch with via twitter the criminal complaint said
at the end of august cornell had allegedly written him an instant message saying the two of them should carry out a lone wolf attack as a way of supporting isis
he didn't think isis or al qaeda would give them an official sign off but he felt he didn't need it
we already got a thumbs up from the brothers over there and anwar al awlaki before his martyrdom and many others cornell allegedly wrote
al awlaki was a u.s. born radical cleric associated with yemen's al qaeda arm
he was killed in a drone attack in two thousand and eleven but his legacy seems to have influence on would be terrorists around the world
cornell allegedly told the informant that he had been in contact with people overseas and that he had aligned himself with isis
and he grew closer to the informant
i believe we should meet up and make our own group in alliance with the islamic state here and plan operations ourselves cornell allegedly <unk> him
the anatomy of isis
how it is run
the two met twice in person in cincinnati the complaint said two days in october and two in november
cornell researched how to build pipe bombs and saved up money to buy weapons and ammunition the complaint read
his father casts doubt on some aspects of the purchase
cornell was unemployed and worked only <unk> for minimum wage
he was about five hundred dollar short of the money needed to make the purchase on his own
he had one thousand two hundred and eighty seven dollar saved up
these guns cost over one thousand seven hundred dollar john cornell said
he thinks someone else had to make up the difference and blames the fbi
he thinks his son was pushed into the plan
cornell wanted to make his move in december the complaint said
he and the informant posing as his partner were to travel to washington scout out the capitol and then detonate the bombs and open fire
everything to know about the rise of isis
in middle school and high school cornell had been a <unk> his father said
after graduation he lived at home and was unemployed not yet knowing what he wanted to do
he very seldom left the house john cornell said
he's a big <unk> boy you know
his best friend is his kitty cat
there's no way he could have carried out any kind of terrorist plot <unk> father said
he didn't even drive
he didn't have a car
he had recently converted to islam which gave him inner peace john cornell said
and he had apparently stopped cutting his beard
on his <unk> at the butler county jail it's long and appears <unk>
heck no john cornell said
there's no way my son was involved with isis
later he told cnn
i just want everyone to know that my son is not a monster
i'm not just saying that because he's my son
if i thought he was up to something i would have beat his butt and i would have been the first one to turn him in
mom will stay in jail until trial on isis related charges
cornell graduated from oak hills high school in two thousand and twelve where he was a typical student the school district said
his teachers remember him as a quiet but not too shy student who participated in class
christopher was not a disruption or a discipline problem in school the school district said in a statement
his teachers were shocked at the news of his involvement in this situation
according to the local police chief cornell had never been in serious trouble before either
he protested a ceremony in two thousand and thirteen to commemorate the september eleven two thousand and one attacks holding a sign that read nine eleven was an inside job green township police department chief bart west told cnn
but he was not arrested or detained
cornell was also a person of interest in a case of vandalism in two thousand and thirteen the chief said
again he was not charged
cornell made a friend on the internet his father believes and posted comments in defense of muslims
chris may have said some things out of anger john cornell said
but he has a hard time believing his son encouraged armed jihad
once after his son stayed out with a friend once for two hours john cornell asked him where he'd been
he said that he had went to a mosque john cornell said
then chris moved out quietly
i never seen him leave his father said
his son left him a note in his former bedroom
it said he had decided to move in with a friend who had also offered him some work
since his son's arrest he says he and his wife have not heard anything from officials about where cornell is
they say they love their son more than ever and that they are heartbroken
he may be facing life in prison john cornell said

the overall number of detainees has dropped from eight hundred when the facility was first <unk> to hold captives from the united states war on terror
the transfer is part of the white house's ongoing effort to close the guantanamo bay detention center
president barack obama stated in an interview on cnn's state of the union back in december that he's going to be doing everything i can to close it
the pope stressed that there was no justification for the killing of seventeen people in three separate incidents including a massacre in and around the offices of satirical magazine charlie hebdo
the assailants were reportedly islamist extremists some of whom called out allahu akbar which is arabic for god is great as they singled out the magazine french authorities and jewish people
one can not make war kill in the name of one's own religion francis said on his way to the philippines
to kill in the name of god is an aberration
still even as he decried the violence and generally spoke in support of freedom of expression the pontiff said that such freedom must have its limits
he didn't mention charlie hebdo specifically or its cartoon depictions of mohammed something that many muslims find offensive
a previous cartoon was one reason the paris magazine was targeted and it didn't back down afterward with its post attack cover showing mohammed again this time crying and holding a sign with the rallying cry je suis charlie french for i am charlie
still even without talking about the magazine by name the pope <unk> his remarks by saying let's go to paris let's speak clearly
he then referred to recent violence there as well as the debate about freedom of expression
francis said on his flight from <unk> sri lanka to manila that everyone had not only the liberty but also the obligation to say what he thinks to help the common good
but he added that this should be done without giving offense because human dignity should be respected
if a friend says a swear word against my mother then a punch awaits him francis said
vatican radio reported that he then gestured with a pretend punch directed at the friend alberto gasbarri an action that many journalists interpreted as a joke
vatican spokesman thomas rosica later told cnn the remark was spoken colloquially adding the pope wasn't advocating violence or in any way justifying the terror attacks
right after the punch gesture francis said it's normal it's normal
one can not provoke one can not insult other people's faith one can not make fun of faith
later francis arrived in the philippines asia's most catholic nation and one hungry for his arrival
everything from the country's supreme court to <unk> businesses have closed down but the streets have come alive
people have been pouring into the capital from all over the country to greet the head of the catholic church as he starts his five day visit
on street corners in malls on public transport it's impossible not to feel the presence of the pope
giant billboards with an official red and blue pope logo <unk> many of manila's buildings while <unk> vendors sell images of his smiling face on everything from stamps and towels to fans and key chains
filipinos have been granted a national holiday for the visit the coast guard has declared a no sail zone within a mile of manila bay many of the capital's main roads will be closed and manila's airport has limited its operations
an estimated forty thousand security personnel will be deployed to keep the pope safe during his time in manila and <unk> where he will celebrate mass in tacloban a city still coming to terms with the devastation caused by typhoon haiyan a year ago
pope francis visit is being billed as one of mercy and compassion
but in a country where a conservative church has fought strongly against legislation allowing government distribution of birth control as well as the legalization of divorce some filipinos hope this <unk> more open minded approach might lead to change

pope says visit not about him
young people such as john <unk> a twenty four year old student who is traveling six hours to see the pope in the capital says he's the kind of leader in the church that the young need
he's approachable listens and answers questions explains and does not ignore questions that are controversial he said
<unk> peterson also twenty four agreed
since he is not so black and white it makes us think i want to hear more of what he has to say about this she said
indeed for many people in the philippines having a head of church with these qualities is welcome
anthony j. vizmanos twenty five was asked to leave his home when he came out as gay to his deeply religious parents
he said he still <unk> goes to church and receives <unk> but has been driven away by what he calls irony in the church's teachings
the church says it's ok to be gay as long as you don't engage in homosexual acts
but if you say you accept us for being gay then why are you stopping us from acting gay
we are not plants that <unk>
we need love and affection too
vizmanos who went to catholic schools for most of his life told cnn i no longer join catholic community groups
i practice what i know and believe instead of what they are telling me to believe
o
ne woman who described herself as a modern catholic but preferred to remain anonymous said the vatican hierarchy needs to be revamped
the pope is introducing changes that the ancient church needs to keep in step with the twenty one st century
there are too many antiquated irrelevant rules that turn off the youth
this pope is a breath of fresh air
the church's staunch position on artificial birth control that it's a sin and will relax moral standards is an example
a woman should have the right to decide what form to use to prevent unwanted pregnancies she added
birth control is not abortion
vizmanos says he feels the church in the philippines is less tolerant than the pope and hopes its <unk> will become more moderate after his visit
a priest near my home says in each homily that gay people are condemned to <unk> he said
i hope the pope can shed some humility to people like him
the church here is too rooted in their causes whereas the pope is more accepting
one of the most divisive issues in the philippines in recent years is a controversial bill that addresses birth control
the reproductive health bill which allows the government to distribute and educate the public about artificial birth control finally passed last year after a fourteen year battle but the fight with the church and more conservative elements in the philippines over its implementation continues today
christine <unk> forty eight who works for a women's youth organization does not believe in divorce or birth control
of course we have problems but introducing these things will not solve them
it's better to educate people in <unk> like <unk> or <unk> learning to face difficulties without giving up easily
although media have widely reported the pope making what could be considered more liberal comments about controversial issues such as birth control homosexuality and divorce which is illegal here he has not actually made any changes to church policy
father <unk> <unk> a prominent filipino <unk> says pope francis has just started changing how he handles his people
he just said that you should openly discuss these things
let everybody have the chance to talk
but then when the discussion is over he and his advisers will make a decision but the decisions have not been made
catholics like <unk> peterson hope that the pope's progressive approach may one day lead to the right to divorce
but <unk> <unk> jr. bishop emeritus of <unk> says divorce which critics say will ruin the family a cornerstone of filipino life and faith is something that will never be allowed

the fight to make divorce legal
i don't think the pope will even hint to filipino bishops and say
hey guys <unk> up on this will you
because this would not be in accord with the catholic spirit and teachings
i am sure he will never agree to gay marriage either he said
peterson says he believes it's about trust and being open to different interpretations
don't you trust your people enough to give them a choice
if i was solid in my faith and didn't believe in divorce then i would not do it she said
you can't define a family from the dictionary
does that mean if you grew up with just a father that it's not family
that you were not taken care of or protected or loved
cardinal <unk>
pope francis says philippines visit not about him
in one thousand nine hundred and seventy blessed pope paul vi included the philippines in his <unk> pilgrimage to asia and <unk>
saint pope john paul ii came to the philippines twice in one thousand nine hundred and eighty one and in one thousand nine hundred and ninety five for the world youth day
twenty years later we welcome pope francis
every papal visit is unique bearing the influence of the unique personalities of the <unk> and the changing circumstances in the country the church and the world
in one conversation i had with pope francis he expressed a wish i am not supposed to be the focus of the <unk> trip to the philippines
jesus should be the focus
i have tried my best to communicate this expectation of the holy father to the filipino nation and to those involved in the preparation for the visit
his sentiment should be our sentiment too
his christ centered understanding of his pilgrimage should provide us with the pivotal point of the many events that would occur
the theme of the <unk> visit mercy and compassion should be qualified as the mercy and compassion of jesus <unk> in the <unk>
in the light of this desire of the pope i would like to emphasize a few expectations of the visit
first pope francis comes after the celebration of the year of the <unk> in the philippines which was observed in two thousand and fourteen
we await the impetus and encouragement that the successor of peter would give to our lay faithful in <unk> their personal encounter with jesus and in bringing the gospel of jesus to all aspects of life conscience family culture politics finance science arts sports migration labor <unk> inter religious dialogue and social communications
we await the pope's word to the <unk> and <unk> men and women on how to foster communion with the lay faithful
we await the pope to send us again as missionaries wherever we are especially in asia
we eagerly await pope francis to strengthen us as jesus once told peter i have prayed for you that your own faith may not fail and you when once you have turned back strengthen your brothers
but we must listen to pope francis
it is not enough that we see him come close to him or even touch him
we have been begging the filipino people to listen to the gospel of jesus that would reach us through the holy father
the <unk> visit will make a difference to the philippine church and society only if we listen and act on what we have heard
secondly pope francis comes after a series of natural and human caused disasters that the filipino people experienced in two thousand and thirteen and two thousand and <unk> earthquakes <unk> and armed conflicts
but let us not forget the daily disaster of poverty and inequality as seen in children and families living on the streets homeless people human trafficking unemployment and <unk> forced migration prostitution illegal drugs corruption missing persons and environmental <unk>
pope francis will bring the mercy and compassion of jesus to the tired weary and those who find life <unk>
they await the assurance that jesus remains the shepherd who has compassion for the hungry crowds
we await the renewed challenge for the <unk> and religious to embody the love patience and healing of the jesus as they bring the good news to the poor
we await the call of the pope to the <unk> of government culture and the economy to return to love as the supreme law that must shape their policies and programs
we await the holy father to encourage all efforts to forge peace especially in parts of <unk> and to promote good will among peoples of different religions
we eagerly await in pope francis the love that peter once professed to jesus who asked him simon son of john do you love me more than these
this love for jesus made peter a shepherd with the mission of feeding and tending the sheep of jesus
we will see pope francis love for jesus in his <unk> charity towards us
finally pope francis comes to us as one like us or in his own words as a regular human being a <unk> who has experienced god's mercy
his simple words and gestures will make jesus and the church more accessible to filipinos
we await the successor of peter
a brother a father and a friend
the filipino people are filled with joy
pope francis gets huge philippines welcome amid calls for change
on wednesday <unk> <unk> now twenty four told her story to investigating officers of the los angeles police department
more than twenty women have come forward with claims of sexual assault against the comedian
many of the accusations date back decades
no charges have been filed against cosby and his attorneys have vehemently denied the allegations
these victims are brave smart sophisticated women who for many years have lived with this secret said spencer <unk> <unk> attorney
mr. cosby should and will be held accountable for what he's done
<unk> believes his client may be the first <unk> to have a case that falls within the statute of limitations for bringing criminal charges
he declined to go into specifics of what <unk> says happened between cosby and her at the playboy mansion in two thousand and eight
she was <unk>
she doesn't know what happened she blacked out and woke up finding mr. cosby over her as she was in a state of complete <unk> he said
i don't want to go into details about what he was doing and i don't believe any of these cameras can actually publish what he was doing <unk> told reporters
an attorney for cosby did not immediately return a request for comment wednesday on the latest allegation
woman alleges cosby raped her and other playboy <unk>
cindy <unk>
i think it's too soon to evaluate the french and broader european response to the attacks
but i'd like to address what i hope will come of this
we're hearing calls for increased intelligence cooperation and potentially boots on the ground in iraq and syria
intelligence cooperation is always helpful of course
but i doubt that any amount of increased government cooperation against terrorists will <unk> to end the threat
terrorism ends when terrorists have no audience and no new recruits
they become marginalized
that happens when the people whose needs they claim to represent are themselves no longer marginalized
it seems to me that having so many world leaders in paris was an opportunity to make progress in building new relationships that bring people together
that may seem <unk> but i don't see any other way out of this
<unk> <unk>
i think france faces two challenges how to respond domestically to integrate muslim minorities in addition to decreasing <unk> racism and how to craft an international policy to confront radical islam
unfortunately for france these policies are directly correlated
every step paris takes on the international stage by forcefully attacking al qaeda and the islamic state in iraq and syria will lead to domestic blowback and further muslim alienation
moreover france has become a british <unk> in that it largely toes america's middle east line
in some cases such as iran it's even <unk> than the pope
since the presidency of nicolas <unk> france has abandoned its anti u.s. israeli posture of the post charles de gaulle era
it is actively involved in the anti isis air campaign in iraq
it was willing to attack syria for its use of chemical weapons
there's very little more it can do to join the american camp
if there is one area where france can better integrate it's on intelligence
the u.s. and france have an uneasy relationship
washington has historically been frustrated by paris corporate spying against american companies
sahar aziz
to me european government responses to the paris attacks show that western countries are unwilling to meaningfully address the root causes of terrorism <unk> out of the middle east
rather than examining why groups like isis and al qaeda are able to recruit so many people from across the world government officials appease public anger by calling for more aggressive anti terrorism laws which is basically code for <unk> targeting muslims within their countries
whether through <unk> alleged terrorists of citizenship censoring websites that are deemed to <unk> terrorism or sending informants to <unk> muslims into sting operations
these are merely reactive tactics that do not begin to address the much deeper underlying causes of the troubling spread of violent extremist views and practices within the middle east
indeed <unk> citizens who are muslim of civil liberties ultimately harms the entire nation's <unk> because history shows it is just a matter of time before those same laws are applied against other groups the government <unk> suspicious
so when the french government meets with officials from the u.s. the u.k. germany and other western nations to discuss how to better cooperate on combating terrorism they would be well advised to focus on the causes rather than the symptoms
resources are better spent on assisting indigenous <unk> in the middle east whether secular or islamist in their efforts to create more political space for freedom of speech association and expression
european nations must recognize that their support of authoritarian regimes in egypt algeria morocco and the gulf states creates fertile environments for extremism that arises out of the brutality of those regimes
we can't keep separating a western nation's foreign policies in the middle east from its domestic national security
the sooner we recognize that the freedom of muslims in the middle east affects our own freedoms in the west the sooner we can begin to meaningfully address the root causes of global terrorism
shadi hamid
i wish it were otherwise but there's little reason to be optimistic the impressive and inspiring show of solidarity at the paris unity march wasn't necessarily a sign of things to come
thirteen years after september eleven the u.s. and its european allies are still struggling with the same basic set of questions
in fact in many ways we seem to be <unk>
two thousand and fourteen was the muslim world's <unk> jihadi moment where extremists made unprecedented gains in syria iraq yemen nigeria and libya
terrorist groups are very difficult to fight for the simple reason that they draw strength from basic flaws in our democracies flaws which are very difficult if not impossible to address
some ask why self proclaimed defenders of the faith would commit acts that put western muslims at such great risk
except that that's the point
the more european muslims are shunned because of jihadist blowback the more appealing radical messages become
just as islamist extremists benefit the far right an emboldened french far right benefits islamist extremists allowing them to drive a greater wedge between muslims and non muslims and feed their clash of civilizations narrative
the al qaeda playbook since nine eleven has been to provoke western powers into doing things they otherwise wouldn't to drag them into as michael <unk> says somebody else's civil war
in this sense the iraq war was a <unk> to al qaeda
so too was abu ghraib
by dangerously <unk> and <unk> we fell into a trap
and we will likely fall into another trap and another trap after that
europe's far right which was already surging will use the paris attacks to advance its <unk> agenda
more french citizens out of fear will find their message appealing
the state has a role to play in calling for calm and promoting inclusive policies but it can only do so much
among citizens terrorism <unk> a very natural reaction fear coupled with an overwhelming desire for security
but it's that very reaction that fuels the cycle of muslim alienation
democracies are particularly susceptible to this because elected leaders however well intentioned can not afford to ignore public sentiment
and in foreign policy the u.s. france britain and others are likely to double down on the narrow counterterrorism approach that has defined western policy toward the arab world in recent years
cindy <unk>
i agree with all of your comments and especially appreciate your take on western public opinion and pressures it places on policymakers shadi
however wherever you can identify a <unk> you can also find opportunity
public opinion is one of those <unk> and it can turn
now i'm not naive enough to think this is an easy or straightforward process
but we do know something about how movements are built and sustained
the <unk> jihadi movement has done this <unk> sadly
we can do it too but to do so we have to go beyond the safe prediction that it will never happen because its too hard and imagine how it might happen
first there must be a simple powerful message that appeals to people on a fundamental even <unk> level
then the message must be disseminated to people where they live so to speak
in the one thousand nine hundred and ninety s the islamic awakening movement in saudi arabia distributed <unk> and eventually <unk> rather than relying on television or other mainstream media
now movements use twitter facebook and such
today the kind of brave yet peaceful unity displayed in the rally in france draws on one such simple but powerful idea we are all one
je suis charlie <unk> <unk> jewish
etc
next it takes some degree of organization and often private funding to keep the message rolling
the jihadists formed groups and councils backed by wealthy individuals then created or took over charitable organizations schools and media centers to spread their message
publishers in france rallied around charlie hebdo
eventually movements can influence government in a variety of ways
<unk> are notoriously poor at listening to people and in fact stifle public opinion that challenges the state in any way so it's no surprise that what began as a fundamentalist movement in the middle east evolved into violent revolution and eventually spawned terrorist groups
democracies are designed to be better at responding to public opinion as you noted shadi
where there is freedom of speech and means to communicate messages can reach a tipping point
is one rally in france enough
of course not
but it did tap into something that many of us believe but are often not brave enough to say that we are all one
there is strength in numbers
perhaps this movement can be sustained
it will be interesting to watch
shadi hamid
cindy i really hope you're right
i wish i could be optimistic about this message of unity going viral but i'm afraid i just can't muster it right now
we are all one is indeed a powerful message but what does it actually mean underneath the good sentiment and a kind of liberal faith that all people are essentially good and want the same things regardless of culture religion and so on
except we aren't all one
in recent days even if we limit our scope to western liberals there is a pretty striking lack of consensus about the limits of free speech the need to restrict hate speech how we treat religions versus ethnicities and the <unk> of secularism to the western liberal model
<unk> <unk> has written about how french teachers were <unk> that a significant number of muslim students refused to stand up for a moment of silence after the paris attacks
but this is where confusion has <unk> into the debate
even if we could be united what would we be united about
what was the unity march really about
ostensibly it was about solidarity with france and among the french in the face of the paris killings
but apparently many people also think it was about <unk> the right to <unk> or even a broader faith in a kind of sacred <unk>
these aren't quite the same things
i don't believe there's a cultural divide on the specific question of slaughter at charlie hebdo and to even suspect as a starting point that french muslims might be okay with the mass slaughter of other french is well a bit troubling
but beyond the killings there is a cultural divide
many more french muslims than non muslims are likely to view blasphemy as unacceptable
it's problematic to view condemning the paris killings and supporting the right to <unk> as two sides of the same coin
for many muslims in the middle east and many muslims in france they aren't
sahar aziz
all thoughtful comments
but i'd like to take another angle to address the original question
when addressing how france is reacting to the charlie hebdo attacks i'm admittedly more concerned with their failure to prevent the attacks
indeed i'm <unk> as to how an intelligence community as experienced as france's <unk> primarily from its brutal opposition to the algerian independence movement and intervention in algeria's bloody civil war didn't discover the plot in the planning stages
neither <unk> had a clean record or committed these <unk> acts with no warning
indeed both brothers were known to french security services and one brother had spent time in jail for assisting in recruiting fighters to join militant groups in iraq
so where was french intelligence and law enforcement when the brothers reportedly purchased the automatic rifles <unk> the newspaper's security system and planned the details of the attacks
how could they have missed such a devastating attack
in my opinion either something is seriously broken in the french intelligence community or the security services were stretched too thin engaging in ineffective ethnic and religious profiling among france's population of over five million muslims
whatever explains the breakdown in security french citizens deserve answers
<unk>
sahar i have the same questions but as a former practitioner i'm not inclined to take an approach that looks for blame but only for answers
here in the u.s. we play the blame game all the time which inevitably <unk> into a political <unk> contest if you'll pardon the phrase with the result that the public never gets the real answers and reforms never address some of the most important issues
there are so many parts to the system we call intelligence that it's a wonder our security agencies succeed as well as they do
for example it only takes one of several intelligence or police decision makers or small groups on numerous levels to decide that someone is no longer a threat for that person to fall off surveillance
when intelligence and police services are stretched <unk> must happen and more people will cease to be monitored by police
now analysts might very well continue to monitor a network including individuals who have fallen off the law enforcement radar but analysts don't do surveillance or make arrests
they don't make decisions about resources or interface with policymakers who have conflicting agendas
and if there's political and social pressure to avoid even the appearance of profiling even if they aren't that <unk> down into intelligence and law enforcement policy
so there's no such thing as perfect security
you can sacrifice perfect short term security for long term peace or long term peace for perfect short term security
trying to have both leads to an ongoing ping pong match in which neither wins
sahar aziz
thanks cindy
i agree that playing the blame game is counterproductive but i still believe it's worthwhile to determine what went wrong so that the same mistakes aren't made again in the future
inherent in that process is determining whether it was an intelligence failure in the sense that accurate information about the true threat of these individuals didn't get to the appropriate law enforcement agents or whether it was a policy failure
that's a question worth answering not only to avoid another tragic attack but also to remind the government that it shouldn't respond to violence by simply spying and investigating more muslims in france
that will only feed into the violent extremists narrative that the west is at war with islam
the french government should look into why french citizens choose to join extremist groups such as isis and al qaeda
similar to the u.s. anti gang approaches france should work with muslim communities to address any underlying social issues that may cause young people to be more susceptible to joining extremist groups
the more meaningful opportunities that citizens have to obtain equal access to quality education <unk> employment and fair treatment by their compatriots the less likely they are to be <unk> into <unk> groups
more importantly they will be more integrated into mainstream french muslim communities and mosques that can provide them with an accurate understanding of islam rather than the warped and apocalyptic <unk> spread by isis al qaeda and their <unk>
<unk> <unk>
on your point sahar governments knee jerk reaction is to initially target muslim communities
but over time as they realize there's no quick fix they must confront policies that have driven muslims to embrace radicalism
it's at this time that their true dilemma stares them down they can't change societal views
racism is so <unk> in europe
the reality is that no policies will be able to integrate muslims into french society
they are not french their cultural traditions are uniquely different and they live in <unk> areas
this doesn't mean that some don't break out of this paradigm
there are those who become ministers and confidants in the highest halls of power
however as one who has lived in france and heard muslim grievances the average muslim never breaks through
they are destined to a life on the margins of society
the <unk> brothers fit <unk> into the french muslim paradigm petty criminals who could not succeed let alone integrate they turn to a religion they never knew to find acceptance
they find a <unk> <unk> preacher to guide them
this is not traditional islam
rather it's islam transplanted into <unk> characterized by a western <unk> one that struggles to provide answers to an ever <unk> culture
shadi hamid
<unk> i found your response really interesting and was wondering if you could elaborate a bit
you say muslims in france are not french
but most of them are french at least in the sense that they're french citizens and have no other country to call home
presumably a french muslim can or at least should be able to believe in <unk> things while still being a good productive citizen of france as long as he or she expresses that <unk> through legal democratic channels
<unk> <unk>
i can do no better than to refer you to this article from la <unk> <unk>
the hashtag <unk> has sixty six thousand tweets and that of <unk> more than forty thousand

you're well familiar with the one thousand nine hundred and seventy egyptian group <unk> <unk> <unk>
identity is what one chooses to be
applying categories to the other doesn't necessarily ensure they will choose that
you are identifying french muslims as french not them
it isn't that french muslims don't identify with the <unk> values
these communities are so removed from their original traditional society that their attachment to religion is weak
rather french society has <unk> them in some ways
they are totally alienated and <unk> identity will not change this
shadi your post <unk> that you advocate changing french society from above through government action
but the greatest challenge is to change french societal views and that simply can not be accomplished
you are fighting an uphill battle that has few chances for success
sahar aziz
<unk> and shadi you raise important points
if it's true that french society will never truly accept muslim or arab french citizens as equals beyond formal equality on the books then france is on the wrong side of history
the world is <unk> and that includes <unk> across countries and regions usually for economic benefits both to <unk> individuals and the receiving countries
nations whose people pursue cultural <unk> reinforced by official policies and practices are inviting social unrest and the <unk> social problems
but regardless of whether non muslim french citizens accept their muslim compatriots they are here to stay and are likely to increase in number
so it's wiser to accept that french identity will be affected their presence
whether those effects are positive or negative depends largely on the french people's willingness to practice their proclaimed belief in fraternity and liberty
this applies to other european countries that are also experiencing migration <unk> from people within europe and other regions
while america has its flaws in terms of race relations the national identity is less rigid and more <unk> than many european countries
i realize this is due in part to its vastly different history
but at a time when countries should be collaborating and learning what works and does not work it's time for the french to accept the new <unk> world that we all live in and be more inclusive of other cultures and ethnicities of people who settle into france
otherwise i fear we may start seeing a <unk> of french muslim identity under the <unk> of counterterrorism

it's a temple of french <unk> a three michelin starred pantheon of la cuisine <unk> now <unk> by <unk> son alain and run with <unk> hospitality from the <unk> <unk> through to the <unk> four
under dutch <unk> richard <unk> amber at the landmark mandarin has gone from strength to strength
the mystery for serious diners is why he's not been awarded an elusive but thoroughly <unk> third michelin star to join the two he's held for a decade
<unk> takes classic french technique and execution and throws in global flavors and produce to deliver often brilliantly innovative dishes delivering an atlas of <unk> cuisine on a plate
few chefs have had as much impact on contemporary american cuisine as alice waters
she opened <unk> <unk> back in one thousand nine hundred and seventy one and espoused a philosophy that has now become mainstream namely to eat local seasonal produce wherever possible
her legendary berkeley restaurant is a warm inviting temple to this thinking where the ingredients do the talking for a menu that changes daily

while testifying in court in <unk> delaware over <unk> request for a no contact order busch said that driscoll is an <unk> for the u.s. government who would go on covert missions around the world
he also said that driscoll had claimed a character in the movie zero dark thirty was based on her and other women
in his testimony busch said that once when he and driscoll were in el paso texas driscoll went out in <unk> gear only to return later wearing an evening gown covered with blood and a trench coat
when asked by his attorney rusty <unk> why he believed driscoll is a hired killer busch said everybody on the outside can tell me i'm crazy but i lived on the inside and saw it firsthand
driscoll and her attorney carolyn <unk> did not challenge <unk> testimony while in court tuesday
driscoll is a defense contractor and is authorized to carry weapons
police officers correction officers and military personnel are trained to use weapons <unk> told cnn on wednesday
they're not assassins
when asked about <unk> allegations <unk> told cnn we deny that entirely
the family court battle stems from a november incident where driscoll says that busch assaulted her
driscoll has accused busch of grabbing her by the throat and slamming her head into a wall three times while they were in <unk> motor home at <unk> international <unk>
the state attorney general is still investigating the case
<unk> said that his client did not assault driscoll
we know one thing
never ever physically abused her and we're real comfortable that that was made clear today the last two days in particular <unk> said tuesday
<unk> said in a statement in november that busch would fully cooperate in the investigation saying the allegation is a complete <unk> by a woman who has refused to accept the end of a relationship
after the no contact hearing on tuesday busch said he was just glad that the truth got told
one man dominated the headlines peddling optimism
india's new prime minister narendra modi
modi has fashioned a role for himself not only as ceo of india inc. but also as its global ambassador with blockbuster speeches promoting india in new york tokyo and sydney
he is also india's brand manager launching catchy campaigns such as make in india <unk> and digital india
modi has won a broad mandate as evidenced by his party's performance in tricky state elections in december
and yet two thousand and fifteen marks the end of modi's <unk>
after all hope can only go so far
modi's greatest accomplishment in two thousand and fourteen was to offer promise
he energized weary indians
he convinced the world that india had a giant open sign on its front doorstep almost literally with visas on arrival
he spent much of the year in campaign mode in india and abroad
but in two thousand and fifteen modi will need to transition from <unk> to <unk> or else risk <unk> another generation
that suggests two thousand and fifteen will be a defining year for india
let's start with economics
india was blessed with favorable tail winds last year
at the start of modi's term <unk> crude was trading at about one hundred and ten dollar a barrel
by year end prices had <unk>
cheaper oil was a boon to india's economy
the deficit <unk> inflation fell and perhaps most crucially the government took the opportunity to end decades of subsidies and <unk> diesel
new taxes on oil look set to generate billions of dollars in excess revenue every year
india's government will look to use that money well
can it deliver on its promises of clean water and power to one point two five billion indians
can it really improve india's broken infrastructure ports roads trains and bridges some of which never seem to connect
can it begin to fulfill its promise to put a toilet in every home
or has too much been promised
in any case india needs much more money and investment likely from abroad
and modi will need another important currency
cooperation from his lawmakers
india needs to rid itself of <unk> laws on <unk> taxation
it will look to unite its states under a common tax system to foster free trade and business
but these acts will take political will and <unk>
can modi legislate as well as he can campaign
can he really as his government has promised improve india's ranking for doing business from a dismal one hundred and forty two nd in the world to somewhere in the top fifty
these are all questions that modi will need to answer in two thousand and fifteen
foreign policy has come easily to modi so far
he will begin two thousand and fifteen basking in the glow of receiving president barack obama the chief guest at india's republic day on january twenty six
obama will be the first sitting american president to visit india more than once
for modi however good foreign policy means good business
he will look to strike deals not only with obama but with many other world leaders in two thousand and fifteen on energy trade defense and infrastructure partnerships
all that sounds right up modi's alley
the great unknown is how he will respond to a major foreign policy crisis the likes of which he largely escaped in two thousand and fourteen
how will he react to a major <unk> with pakistan
how will he balance his desire to boost chinese trade with fears about beijing's growing <unk> in the region
and what will he do if in a big global crisis he is pushed to choose sides between any of russia china and the united states
can india remain everyone's friend
will modi develop a values based vision of india's place in the world
on domestic issues a year ago modi was known outside india mostly for his inability or worse apathy in stopping one of the worst religious riots in modern indian history when some two thousand muslims were killed in gujarat the state he ran at the time
modi's perceived role led to his u.s. visa being revoked
a year on new york city received modi as if he were a rock star
in the space of a year modi has managed to transform his image abroad from <unk> to visionary leader
recent events are cause for renewed worry
reports of hindu groups forcing christians and muslims to convert to hinduism threaten the very basis of the indian secular state
minorities simply can not live in fear
in two thousand and fifteen modi will need not only to be a voice of reason but he will also have to rein in radical fringe elements of his hindu support base
the safety of women will remain a major issue of concern at home and abroad
at his two thousand and fourteen independence day speech modi remarked how the indian people's heads hang in shame with each report of rape
the sad reality is that modi will probably make the same comment at this year's speech
as i've written previously india has let its women down for centuries
they rank one hundred and thirty four th in the world for economic opportunities one hundred and twenty six th for education and one hundred and forty one st for health
how can that be good enough for a country that <unk> to be a major world power
beyond politics from living and reporting in india i am hopeful about this country's future
my optimism is based less on politics or economics and more on a larger trend
the country's technology boom
while the west has evolved in its internet use from dial up to cable to mobile four g india's journey has been different
it has jumped straight to a mobile revolution
most indians who discover the internet will discover it on a cheap smartphone not a pc
the pace of technology adoption coupled with faster and cheaper hardware will transform india in ways we are only just beginning to comprehend
so expect india to start <unk> many of the problems the west has spent decades dealing with
india has never had a real database of its citizens but soon it will be the first country to have an entirely digital biometric id system
there will be real changes in people's lives and their economies with the help of e commerce and apps for health education banking and transport
beyond oil politics or demographics the biggest tail wind for india lies in its adoption of technology
this will be india's real revolution and it is already underway
<unk> el <unk> a writer with charlie hebdo said the cover means the magazine's journalists were forgiving the extremists for the killings
but the cover could also be interpreted as mohammed saying he <unk> the cartoonists in a way the terrorists obviously did not
but the cartoons are somewhat irrelevant
as middle east analyst juan cole has argued they were just an excuse for islamic zealots to further <unk> and exploit the perceived gulf between islam and the west
cole writes al qaeda wants to mentally colonize french muslims but faces a wall of <unk>
but if it can get non muslim french to be <unk> to ethnic muslims on the grounds that they are muslims it can start creating a common political identity around <unk> against discrimination
enter the cartoons
this is why it is <unk> that political voices around the world especially conservatives have argued that we must show our support for charlie hebdo and free speech by <unk> the magazine's offensive cartoons
remember this is a publication few outside france had heard of before it was targeted and even fewer had read and arguably one that many would have taken offense at in a different context
in fact in a line of thinking best articulated by new york times columnist and cnn contributor ross <unk> the violent reaction to charlie hebdo's offensive cartoons not only justifies but also somehow demands that we not only continue but also ramp up that offense as a form of protest
if a large enough group of <unk> is willing to kill you for saying something then it's something that almost certainly needs to be said wrote <unk>
in other words the violent reaction to something offensive not only retroactively justifies the offense in the first place but <unk> its rationale going forward
some have indeed argued that because some radical islamists resort to violence it justifies not only broad offenses and smears of the entire religion but also thinking of such smears against islam as different from those directed at judaism or christianity
this ignores for example mass murderer anders breivik who left a one thousand five hundred page <unk> proclaiming himself one hundred percents a christian and advancing his vision of a <unk> christian europe
in two thousand and eleven breivik killed seventy seven people in norway
does that attack justify blasphemy against christianity and make it incumbent on all of us to increase such blasphemy as a form of protest
the likely response that violence inspired by christianity or judaism is somehow an exception while violence inspired by islam is a rule i s merely a way of justifying in hindsight and in <unk> smears against a group one has already decided to hate
as adam <unk> at the london review of books has noted right wing <unk> in france and europe more broadly share an organizing principle with jihadists
that there is an apocalyptic war between europe and islam
blanket <unk> of the whole of islam based on the acts of zealots help feed the premise
so do cartoons that <unk> the prophet mohammed
though it's <unk> to demand all muslims apologize or account for the acts of radicals within their faith since the paris attacks such demands have been made and plenty of moderate muslims have spoken out
and yet perhaps part of the reason we don't hear enough from these voices is that they simply don't fit the narrative fueled by the zealots in islam and the west and happily covered by the <unk> loving media
this would also explain why the media and the west are still <unk> on the slaying of seventeen people in france and paying <unk> less attention to as many as two thousand people killed in nigeria by boko haram
it falls outside the us versus them frame and is further evidence that as protesters in the united states have been asserting black lives simply aren't treated as though they matter
i unequivocally and unconditionally support the right to free speech
<unk> free speech is essential to any democratic and <unk> society
so i support the right of charlie hebdo to print the most outlandish offensive cartoons it can come up with
and to give another example i support the free speech rights of french comedian <unk> m'bala m'bala even though i personally find his anti semitic jokes even more offensive and sick than any of the charlie hebdo cartoons i've seen
still i don't think m'bala m'bala should be facing prosecution by the french government for his speech as he has apparently thirty eight times
<unk> i don't see those rallying supposedly in support of free speech protesting m'bala <unk> repeated prosecution
at the same time many of those supposedly proclaiming support for free speech are shaming and <unk> media outlets that choose not to <unk> the charlie hebdo drawings
the <unk> right wing and fundamentalist islamists want the same thing
to convince muslims and the west that there is an inherent divide between the two
the question for the rest of us the ones who have free speech is whether we feed the apocalyptic narrative or fight it
a few <unk> islamists have <unk> and <unk> offended the world
that's no excuse for anyone to go on offending all muslims
to do so only helps advance the terrorists goal
many other people had climbed el <unk> in yosemite national park
none of them ever reached the top after free climbing the dawn wall like tommy caldwell and kevin jorgeson did wednesday
the dawn wall is revered in the climbing world as one of the most daunting <unk> in the world
it feels incredible
we've been working on this since two thousand and nine
tommy first envisioned the line in two thousand and seven so it's been all consuming in our lives since then and it's pretty surreal to wake up this morning and have the climb complete the thirty year old jorgeson told cnn on thursday
it felt like a very spiritual experience the whole time caldwell said during a press conference at yosemite
the journey up the dawn wall was documented on caldwell and <unk> instagram accounts caldwell and <unk> facebook accounts and youtube
the two began climbing on december twenty seven and didn't leave the wall until they finished
they slept in hanging <unk>
others sent them food when they needed it
they had safety ropes for the times they lost hold
caldwell thirty six lost his voice from the shouting that the two did as they communicated which steps to take
the worst injuries were small cuts to their fingers
caldwell has climbed el <unk> sixty times and spoke of his intense love of the national park
i crave time in yosemite like i crave food and water he said
he and jorgeson described climbing as an art and a way to get in touch with nature and to respect its power
climbs shouldn't be compared to each other caldwell said just as paintings shouldn't be compared
jorgeson said he wishes some media stories would stop <unk> their accomplishment as an ambition to conquer nature
this isn't about us versus it he said adding that he hoped that the global attention the climb has received would inspired others to find their own dawn wall
many people can relate to the importance of <unk> in achieving a dream he said
on cnn the two were asked whether they ever thought so much about the climb during the planning stages that they became too intimidated to actually try it
there were times when i questioned whether i'd be able to do it but never the idea caldwell said
when he and jorgeson reached the top they embraced and fist <unk> caldwell said recalling that he said something to his climbing partner like this was a <unk> experience
this is spectacular <unk> mother terry told cnn affiliate <unk>
this was his biggest project his biggest dream
he called it his <unk> dick
he kept saying i don't know if this is possible
i'm just going to keep working on it
there are more than one hundred routes up el <unk> but only a handful have been attempted by climbers trying to free climb
so proud of <unk> one and <unk> for conquering el <unk>
you remind us that anything is possible
bo president barack obama tweeted
seeing that quote jorgeson said was pretty unbelievable
in the video the boy who has been identified as abdullah in prior isis videos sports long hair and wears a black sweater and military fatigue pants
he stands behind the two men who are kneeling and shoots them in the back of the head in a <unk> produced video with slow motion
the boy stands over one of the bodies fires two more times and later raises his pistol high
cnn can not verify the authenticity of the video but it appears to be the first time isis has shown a child carrying out an execution
the video's title is <unk> an enemy within and states that enemies thought that they could dispatch spies and agents to plot against the islamic state but allah <unk> their efforts and thwarted their plans
everything to know about the rise of isis
the islamic state in iraq and syria is using warfare and terror in an attempt to create an islamic state or caliphate across the sunni areas of iraq and in syria
isis has featured children as fighters before calling them the cubs of the caliphate a play on words referring to how jihadis are called lions
isis has encouraged foreign fighters to bring their families and has taken over schools to <unk> children
in june human rights watch documented the experiences of twenty five children and former child soldiers in syria's civil war and asserted that <unk> armed groups have used children as young as fifteen to fight in warfare and used others as young as fourteen in support roles
isis and other extreme islamists have specifically recruited children through free schooling campaigns that include weapons training and have given them dangerous tasks including suicide bombing missions the rights group said
in earlier isis videos the boy named abdullah says that he's from kazakhstan and wants to grow up to kill infidels
he appears to be asian
isis has used shocking imagery of children in the past
in august a seven year old australian boy held a man's severed head reportedly in the isis held town of raqqa syria
the photo was posted on twitter by his australian father khaled <unk> who wrote that's my boy
the international community condemned the incident and photograph
the london based syrian observatory for human rights said russians did infiltrate syria in late december and made up the majority of nineteen men who went to the isis held area of al <unk>
the observatory is an activist group opposing the syrian government embroiled in a civil war where isis has established strongholds
the video shows the two men being questioned by someone off screen and they identify themselves as <unk> <unk> <unk> thirty eight who was born near <unk> kazakhstan and <unk> sergey <unk> thirty
both men say they are informants for the russian intelligence service
in the questioning of the thirty eight year old man the video states that service as fsb or <unk> federal security service
the russian state security organization could not be immediately reached for comment wednesday
the russian state news agency ria reported that the fsb and the russian embassy in syria refused to comment on the situation
on january four <unk> <unk> the head of the <unk> republic told the news agency <unk> that russia has an intelligence network within isis
when asked whether there was an isis terrorism threat in chechnya <unk> stated
there is no threat
we are <unk> ourselves with isis
within the ranks of <unk> of terrorists we have a good intelligence network
this allows us to track the movement of those who are of interest to us
moreover it allows us to send those who even as a joke direct the barrel towards russia on an <unk> trip with a one way ticket
the anatomy of isis
how it is run
earlier the country's military said that nigerian soldiers had thwarted a boko haram attack on wednesday in the town of biu in the restive northeastern section of the country
critics have accused jonathan's government of not doing enough to address the insurgency which mostly affects opposition strongholds
nigeria is holding presidential elections in february
earlier this month jonathan launched his re election bid in a raucous rally in lagos
the nigerian defense headquarters said five terrorists and two anti aircraft guns had been captured
officials gave no casualty tolls but residents told cnn that at least forty boko haram fighters were killed when they were surprised by nigerian soldiers and fought a lengthy gun battle
scores of boko haram militants in ten <unk> and two motorcycles attempted to storm the town two hundred kilometers south of the borno state capital maiduguri around seven thirty a.m. local time
they were intercepted by soldiers from nearby military barracks leading to two hour gunfight residents said
dozens of troops lay in wait for the militants and opened fire on an advance team of three <unk> carrying the gunmen near an <unk> two kilometers outside biu residents said
soldiers killed forty boko haram insurgents and foiled their attempt to take over the barracks and attack the town said biu resident <unk> <unk>
all thirty gunmen in the three vehicles were killed by the barrage of gunfire from the soldiers
the remaining gunmen who had camped at a gas station in nearby <unk> village mobilized and faced the troops in a fierce battle that lasted two hours said <unk> <unk> another resident
the gunmen were overwhelmed and forced to retreat in <unk> according to witnesses
soldiers aided by local vigilantes went on their trail in the bush while youths armed with crude weapons set up barricades in different parts of the town to prevent infiltration by the gunmen
residents <unk> to the scene of the fighting to see the dead gunmen and their bullet riddled <unk> <unk> said
biu is a religiously mixed town and the largest in southern borno
it is an important commercial center that includes a large military base
although boko haram has carried out several raids on villages in the area in the past two years biu has never been attacked residents said
boko haram has terrorized northern nigeria regularly since two thousand and nine attacking police schools churches and civilians and bombing government buildings
the islamist group has said its aim is to impose a stricter form of sharia law across nigeria which is split between a majority muslim north and a mostly christian south
last week it <unk> a town and some villages near the border with chad killing hundreds perhaps thousands of people
human rights watch said it acquired satellite imagery that shows the results of fires set by boko haram
the rights group said eleven percents of baga and fifty seven percents of doro <unk> were scarred by the flames
boko haram's brutal tactics have shocked and stunned the world
it has kidnapped students including more than two hundred schoolgirls who were abducted in april and remain missing
it has also strapped bombs to young girls and ordered them to blow themselves up in markets according to one teenager who said she refused and fled the scene of an attack
what made us laugh the most is that the bells of notre dame rang in our honor
for a week now charlie has been moving far more than mountains across the world
for a week now as <unk> has shown us so <unk> in his drawing charlie has many new friends
some anonymous and some global celebrities
some humble and some affluent
some <unk> and some religious leaders
some sincere and some akin to <unk>
some who will be with us for the rest of our lives and some who are just passing by
we take them all on board today we have neither the time nor the heart to separate them out
but that doesn't mean that we are fooled
we wholeheartedly thank those in their millions whether simple citizens or <unk> institutions who are truly at our sides who deeply and sincerely are charlie
they will know who they are
<unk> off the others who don't give a <unk> anyway
there is however a question which still <unk> away at us
are we finally going to see the foul expression secular fundamentalist disappear from political and intellectual <unk>
are we finally going to stop <unk> learned <unk> expressions describing equally assassins and their victims
in recent years we have felt rather lonely trying to push back with our <unk> straightforward <unk> and <unk> intellectual <unk> that they were throwing at our faces and that of our friends who were strongly defending secularism
<unk> <unk> <unk> people assuming no responsibility those who throw oil on the fire <unk> you asked for it
yes we condemn terrorism but
yes it is not good to threaten cartoonists with death but
yes setting fire to a magazine's headquarters is wrong but
we've heard it all as have our friends
we've often tried to laugh it off because that's what we're best at
but now really we'd like to laugh at something else
because it's already starting again
cabu charb honore tignous wolinski elsa cayat bernard maris <unk> ourrad michel renaud franck brinsolaro frederic boisseau ahmed merabet clarissa jean philippe philippe braham yohan cohen yoav hattab francois michel saada their blood was not yet dry and thierry <unk> was explaining to his facebook fans that this was obviously a <unk> western american conspiracy
who were the victims
we were already hearing here and there these delicate people put on airs and <unk> on witnessing last sunday's gathering <unk> endless <unk> seeking to justify openly or in whispers terrorism and religious fascism expressing indignation at the fact that we can say police <unk> ss among other things
no in this massacre no one death is less unjust than another
franck who died in <unk> premises and all his police colleagues killed during this barbaric week died to defend ideas which may not even have been their own
nevertheless we are going to try to be optimistic even though it is out of season
we will hope that as of this january seven two thousand and fifteen strongly defending secularism will be second nature for everyone
that we will finally stop posturing for electoral reasons or through <unk> <unk> or even <unk> community <unk> and cultural <unk> which lead to but one thing
religious <unk>
yes the israeli palestinian conflict is a fact yes international geopolitics is a succession of maneuvers and <unk> blows yes the social situation of populations of islamic origin in france as people say is deeply unjust yes we must fight <unk> against racism and all types of discrimination
fortunately there are several instruments with which we can try to solve these serious problems but they are all <unk> if one of them is missing
secularism
not affirmative secularism not inclusive secularism not i don't know what kind of secularism
secularism full stop
pushing for universal rights it alone allows for equality liberty brotherhood and <unk>
it alone allows for total freedom of conscience which all religions as soon as they move from the arena of the strictly intimate into the political arena deny more or less openly according to their marketing position
oddly enough it alone allows believers and others to live in peace
all those who claim to defend muslims while accepting the totalitarian religious rhetoric are in fact defending their <unk>
the first victims of islamic fascism are the muslims
the millions of anonymous people all the institutions all the heads of state and government all the political intellectual and media celebrities all the religious dignitaries who this week proclaimed je suis charlie should know that also means i am secularism
we are convinced that as far as most of our supporters are concerned that goes without saying
the others can do what they like with it
last but not least
we would like to send a message to pope francis who this week he as well is charlie
we will only accept that the bells of notre dame are ringing in our honor when it is the <unk> who are ringing them
he's a big <unk> boy you know
his best friend is his kitty cat john cornell told cnn's anderson cooper three hundred and sixty
there's no way he could have carried out any kind of terrorist plot the father said
i think chris was <unk> into a lot of this
christopher lee cornell twenty came to the fbi's attention several months ago for alarming social media posts in which he talked about his support for violent jihad according to a criminal complaint
he allegedly wrote under the alias raheel <unk> <unk>
the fbi engaged in an undercover operation with the help of a person who began cooperating in exchange for favorable treatment on his criminal exposure on an unrelated case
cornell allegedly told that source he had been in contact with persons overseas and that he had aligned himself with isis
he did not think he would receive specific authorization to conduct a terrorist attack in the united states but stated that he wanted to go forward with violent jihad and <unk> that this would be their way of supporting isil the complaint said using another name for isis
according to the complaint cornell wrote
i believe that we should just wage jihad under our own orders and plan attacks and everything
i believe we should meet up and make our own group in alliance with the islamic state here and plan operations ourselves
the anatomy of isis
how it is run
he was plotting with the undercover fbi operative to set off pipe bombs in the u.s. capitol and shoot people as they fled the complaint said
cornell and the operative allegedly met in cincinnati in october and again in november
he researched the targeted government buildings and the construction of pipe bombs saved money for the attack and bought weapons and ammunition the complaint said
cornell was arrested wednesday
everything to know about the rise of isis
his father said his son who lived at home in green township ohio recently took up an interest in islam but had never mentioned isis
he explained to me you know that islam wasn't a terrorist group
it was a way of life john cornell told cnn's erin burnett <unk>
i don't think chris could hurt a fly he said
he's such a <unk> kind person
according to a law enforcement source the plan posed no threat to lawmakers
but the complaint indicated that the plot was in its late stages
the islamic state in iraq and syria also known as the islamic state and isis is seeking to create a fundamentalist religious state across sunni areas in those two countries
mom will stay in jail until trial on isis related charges
officials have said the fuselage or the main part of the plane might contain many of the bodies of those who were aboard the flight
authorities don't yet know why the plane crashed into the sea december twenty eight while en route to singapore from the indonesian city of surabaya
roughly thirty five minutes into the flight the pilot asked air traffic control for permission to turn left and climb to avoid bad weather
minutes later the plane disappeared from air traffic <unk> radar indonesian officials say
now that the fuselage has been found here are some of the tasks that are ahead for searchers and authorities
the fuselage discovery adds to the significant finds elsewhere in the java sea
authorities earlier this week recovered the plane's cockpit voice and flight data recorders which will help investigators determine what happened to the flight and lifted the tail section of the craft from the sea on saturday
the priority now is to locate bodies and divers are expected to search the fuselage thursday morning indonesia search and rescue chief bambang soelistyo told reporters wednesday
as of wednesday night fifty bodies had been recovered elsewhere some still strapped into their seats officials said
many of the more than one hundred remaining bodies might be found in or near the plane's fuselage
it wasn't clear wednesday whether the cockpit is attached
soelistyo didn't reveal the <unk> depth
but officials have said other debris such as the recorders which were found about a half mile from the fuselage on monday and tuesday were generally discovered at a depth of roughly thirty meters
if divers have trouble accessing the bodies officials may decide to lift the fuselage out of the water soelistyo said
it wasn't immediately clear how that would be done
to recover the tail section on saturday crews inflated giant balloons underneath lifting it from the bottom of the sea
a crane then lifted the tail onto a ship
both the flight data recorder and the cockpit flight recorder are expected to help investigators understand what went wrong
the flight data recorder which stores a vast amount of information about the aircraft's performance including air speed and cabin pressure tells investigators what happened on a plane
but the cockpit voice recorder tells them why said mardjono siswosuwarno a senior official at indonesia's national transportation safety committee which is leading the investigation into the disaster
the why is mostly in there he said of the voice recorder which captures conversations between pilots as well as other sounds in the cockpit
investigators say they have successfully downloaded the contents of both devices
but mardjono cautioned that interpreting the information will require a lot of time
mardjono said he expected a preliminary report to be released within a month of the crash
but it's unclear how much information the initial document will contain beyond what's already been made public
the final report containing investigators full conclusions will take months mardjono said
his agency's final report into adam air flight five hundred and seventy four which crashed in indonesian waters on new year's day two thousand and seven killing all one hundred and two people on board came out more than a year after that disaster
meanwhile mary schiavo a former inspector general of the u.s. department of transportation told cnn that because the recorders data had been downloaded investigators should have a pretty good idea within a couple of days of what happened aboard the plane
but schiavo added that she didn't think officials would release any information publicly for a couple of weeks
french aviation experts are helping the indonesian investigation which also expected to involve airbus the manufacturer of the downed a three hundred and twenty two hundred
observers have suggested that the locations of the different parts of debris indicate the plane broke apart when it hit the water not when it was still at a high altitude
airasia has said it will pay about one hundred and twenty four thousand dollar to the families of each victim one hundred thousand dollar mandated by indonesia's transport ministry's regulations and twenty four thousand dollar for what the airline called financial hardships relating to the initial search period
that is below the amount guaranteed by the montreal convention a treaty that <unk> compensation for the families of air disaster victims
but indonesia did not sign the treaty
families may be able to pursue larger claims through courts cnnmoney reported
it could be some time before the families to receive <unk> payments
in the case of malaysia airlines flight three hundred and seventy which vanished in march families received some initial payments but final amounts haven't been settled according to cnnmoney
