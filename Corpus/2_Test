and these are on top of other horrific allegations such as the killings and <unk> of innocent civilians simply because they didn't <unk> to isis extreme take on sharia law
and that's the thing about isis
its militants have justified their actions like the beheadings of journalists and aid workers in god's name
even then it is rare to see its rationale laid out as <unk> as in question and answers on female slaves and their freedom
in the document for instance it is explained that capturing women is <unk> if they are nonbelievers
it adds female slaves are the women that muslims took from their enemies
much of the pamphlet talks about isis policy on having sexual intercourse with a female slave something that the group <unk> the quran to justify
if she was a virgin he can have intercourse with her immediately after the <unk> is fulfilled isis explains
if she was not a virgin her <unk> must be <unk>
there are other rules as well like that two men who co own a captive can't both have sex with her and that a man can't have intercourse with his wife's slave
as to girls
it is <unk> to have intercourse with the female slave who hasn't reached <unk> if she is fit for intercourse the document reads
however if she is not fit for intercourse he can only enjoy her without intercourse
the <unk> is clear that young and old the captors have full control of their captives
as such the isis document claims it is <unk> to buy sell or give as a gift female captives and slaves for they are merely property
in response to the question of whether a female slave can buy her freedom the answer is yes she can
the document also says that <unk> a slave is something a <unk> who has committed an act like <unk> murder or <unk> can do for his <unk> to be forgiven
alternative actions are <unk> for two consecutive months or feeding hungry people
the pamphlet sets a few other guidelines such as that a captive mother can't be separated from her young children and that an <unk> captive can not be sold
beating a female slave for discipline is ok but beating her for <unk> or as a form of torture is not
there are fewer rules for the captives themselves though the isis pamphlet does identify one thing as the <unk> of <unk> running away from one's master
this document marks the most detailed <unk> not first justification for <unk> nonbelievers as defined by isis
time and again the group <unk> the quran and its view of sharia law
isis is drawing these <unk> from ancient middle eastern and mediterranean <unk> of conduct for war and prisoners said abbas <unk> professor of religious studies at <unk> state university
muslim leaders and lay <unk> the world over continue to condemn isis and find its <unk> interpretation of islam <unk> and abhorrent
unfortunately in the context of failed states and civil wars most <unk> voices are often the most <unk> out
none of isis <unk> hold up <unk> hall university law school professor bernard <unk> wrote on cnn dot com last month
this argument is <unk> wrong <unk> and <unk> <unk> relying on male <unk> inspired by stories from the days of <unk> islam said <unk>
it is also an <unk> to right thinking muslims everywhere and a criminal <unk> of islamic law particularly its primary source the glorious quran
two bombs explosions at a market in the central nigerian city of jos left thirty two people dead a government agency reported marking the latest instance of violence to hit the <unk> region
nigeria's state broadcaster <unk> reported the explosions took place thursday at the <unk> area of the jos market

he kept moving before <unk> one device killing at least two people
people <unk> him but couldn't stop him before he managed to blow himself up <unk> said
the security guard initially told cnn that at least twelve people were dead
on friday nigeria's national emergency management agency said that the bomb blasts killed thirty two people and injured forty five others
it was not immediately clear if the bomber was among those counted as dead
located about two hundred and fifty kilometers northwest of <unk> the nation's capital jos is in an area that has been <unk> by violence in recent years
much of that fighting has <unk> nigerian troops against boko haram the islamist terror group trying to impose its strict version of sharia law across the african nation
citizens have repeatedly been caught up in the <unk> such as mass kidnappings of women and children as well as bombings of schools churches and mosques blamed on boko haram
there was no immediate claim of responsibility for thursday's attack
however boko haram has been tied to violence in jos before including a double car bombing at the same market in may that killed one hundred and eighteen people
can animals go to heaven
some people all over the world have been excited in recent days about reports by news agencies worldwide including one from cnn declaring that pope francis apparently believes they can
it turns out it's unclear what he believes about this
a previous pope paul <unk> had no doubts
one day we will again see our animals in the <unk> of christ paul once told a boy grieving the loss of his pet
that quote from the pontiff who <unk> from one thousand nine hundred and sixty three until his death in one thousand nine hundred and seventy eight was <unk> attributed to francis
the confusion may have begun when italian daily newspaper <unk> <unk> <unk> referred to <unk> quote in a story that carried the headline the pope and animals
heaven is open to all creatures
the story itself does not indicate francis said that
instead it refers back to paul <unk>
the writer for the newspaper pointed to something francis actually did say
sacred <unk> teaches us that the <unk> of this <unk> plan can not but involve everything that surrounds us and came from the heart and mind of god
that <unk> the writer suggested <unk> the hope of <unk> to animals and all of creation
the headline on the article quoted francis as saying heaven is open to all creatures
but there's no sign francis said that
a search through the current pope's <unk> and remarks showed no immediate sign that he has taken a clear position on the question
pope francis to visit united states for first time next fall
while catholic teachings neither reject nor <unk> the notion that animals have souls
there is no hard and fast answer in <unk> to this question
drugs <unk> homosexuality little is off limits for <unk> pope
it's an emotional question for many people

he told cnn its systems were not hacked and that idea has been ruled out completely
aviation security expert <unk> <unk> told cnn the incident had exposed a weakness in the air traffic system a problem that needs to be addressed urgently
we're going to have a major digital forensic effort here i think driven by british authorities maybe with assistance from international aviation authorities to get to the bottom of this as quickly as possible he said
the <unk> aspect here is the <unk> impact of what appears to be one technical error
it doesn't appear like a whole group of people made a mistake or a whole group of systems all had an error at the same time so it tells us somewhere in how the system is <unk> now there are <unk> we did not know about and apparently have not been accounted for in terms of control measures
british airways offered <unk> or the chance to <unk> to any of its passengers not <unk> to travel friday in light of the problems
we <unk> disruption to both <unk> and arriving flights but will do all we can to <unk> any impact it said in a statement
it's not just uk travelers who will be affected by the <unk>

flights from tunisia will be landing at charles de <unk> instead of london

the european air traffic control network <unk> earlier said no flights would be accepted in or out of london until seven p.m
the issue affected the air traffic control center in <unk> which controls all air traffic routes in southern england and wales up to approximately manchester
a second air traffic control center at <unk> in scotland takes over air routes from there
it was not affected nats said
cnn's jim <unk> said more than eighty airlines fly into and out of heathrow with some two hundred thousand people passing through the airport daily
the system is working fine but it's the aircraft that are in the wrong place it's the aircraft that are delayed he said friday evening
there's a number of planes that have been diverted to other places
they still have to get here to london
<unk> the aviation security expert said the resulting effects would be significant
he said they include the parking of the aircraft <unk> <unk> of the aircraft the security <unk> and checking of the aircraft the handling of the passengers at different airports where they're not really planning on that kind of capacity for the coming night perhaps this is happening overseas as well flights that were en route to the united kingdom now <unk> to other places
hopefully this will not affect some of the biggest busiest flights
think about you <unk> an airbus a three hundred and eighty en route to london and you <unk> to <unk> and having to fit that into a schedule of another airport
so these are some major challenges throughout the system that we're hoping and we're assuming authorities not just in the uk but elsewhere as well are ready to handle now

the bush administration which maintained that <unk> had met with iraqi agent ahmad al <unk> in prague in april two thousand and one had used the report to link the september eleven attacks to iraq
cia director john brennan included a portion of the cable in a letter to sen. <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> the <unk> chairman of the senate armed services committee made the letter public on thursday
the cable reads that there is not one <unk> or fbi expert <unk> said they have evidence or know that was indeed
in fact the analysis has been quite the opposite
in a two thousand and one interview with <unk> meet the press then vice president <unk> cheney said it's been pretty well confirmed that did go to prague and he did meet with a senior official of the iraqi intelligence service in last april several months before the attack
cheney repeated those claims which were based on a single source as the nation prepared for war
the fbi and cia had both warned that they were skeptical that <unk> was in prague according to <unk> letter
he noted that both organizations had said previously that <unk> such as the one initially made by the single source who reported the meeting could be <unk> and would require further evidence

washington cia director john brennan on thursday defended harsh interrogation techniques as providing useful information to authorities including in the raid that led to the death of osama bin laden
but he said it is <unk> what information could specifically be attributed to those techniques
it is our considered view that the detainees who were subjected to enhanced interrogation techniques provided information that was useful and was used in the ultimate operation to go against bin laden brennan said
<unk> comments in a rare news conference come two days after a senate panel released a <unk> five hundred and twenty eight page report <unk> enhanced interrogation techniques including <unk> executions <unk> <unk> sleep <unk> and <unk> in <unk> in the mid two thousand s
he admitted that some cia officers actions were not authorized were abhorrent and <unk> should be <unk> by all
and we fell short in holding some officers accountable for their mistakes
brennan acknowledged that the agency sometimes <unk> its legal authority during <unk> of terrorism suspects
he said detainees who faced enhanced interrogation techniques did provide some information that provided useful as well as other information that didn't
he said whether those <unk> had anything to do with that information is <unk>
let me be clear
we have not concluded that it was the <unk> within that program that allowed us to obtain useful information from the detainees subjected to them he said
but he <unk> defended the agency during the forty five minute news conference adding
cia officers actions that did <unk> with the law and policy should neither be criticized nor <unk> with the actions of the few who did not follow the <unk> issued
brennan opened his remarks with a <unk> depiction of the events of the <unk> eleven two thousand and one terrorist attacks and described the atmosphere going into fighting terrorism and collecting intelligence in the immediate aftermath of the attacks
there were no easy answers and whatever your views are on enhanced interrogation techniques our nation and in particular this agency did a lot of things right during this difficult time to keep this country strong and <unk> brennan said
brennan praised those who worked with him but he added the agency was <unk> to conduct a detention and interrogation program and our officers <unk> developed and monitored its initial activities
brennan never used the word torture to describe the cia's tactics
and he <unk> a question about whether in the interest of transparency he supported the senate intelligence committee's decision to release its report
i think there's been more than enough transparency that's happened over the last couple days he said
i think it's over the top
brennan said it's <unk> that the senate panel didn't conduct interviews with cia agents a contrast he said with its handling of a report on iraq's lack of weapons of mass destruction which included interviews with more than two hundred officers
his strongest criticism of the report was with its <unk> that the cia <unk> the public and government officials including then president george w. bush
that brennan said is <unk> a stance former vice president <unk> cheney backed up in an interview with fox news on wednesday night
still he didn't fault the report's finding that the cia's tactics were harsh and at times went beyond the legal authority <unk> justice department said the agency had
many aspects of their conclusions are sound and consistent with our own prior findings brennan said
over the years internal agency reviews including numerous investigations by our office of the inspector general found fault in the cia's running of the program
we have acknowledged these mistakes
brennan was the cia's deputy executive director while the tactics were being used
he said he had some <unk> into what was happening but that he wasn't in the chain of command for that program and didn't say whether he had made any effort to push for changes at the time
he also noted that the program for using enhanced interrogation techniques was ended in two thousand and seven
in light of the fact that these techniques were banned seven years ago however my <unk> hope is that we can put aside this debate and move on to issues that are <unk> to our current national security challenges brennan said
meanwhile one of <unk> <unk> critics sen. <unk> <unk> the <unk> of the committee behind the report live tweeted along with the press conference and sharply <unk> several points throughout his press conference

that the life family and friends you knew are all far far away
the cell door opens
the next session seemingly the one hundred th in a row
i think my first period of interrogation lasted three full months
two teams of <unk> running shifts day and night
each session begins with shouting to wake me up
then they hit me on the face and the back
i am so desperate for sleep my head is swimming
there are photographs of faces stuck all around the walls of this room
they demand that i identify the individuals but i can barely focus to see if i might know them
the shouting and the <unk> get <unk> and then they <unk> to a man in the corner
he <unk> me twice in the arm with some unknown <unk>
it's the last thing i know
the freezing cold cell
the cell door opens
this time the guards enter making awful <unk> <unk> like wild animals
i tried to refuse to eat the little food they bring me in protest at all this
the <unk> <unk> at me but then turns angry
he <unk> <unk> and <unk> an army <unk> pack over my head
they tell the man in the corner to start feeding me <unk>
he <unk> the <unk> in two different places on my arm and makes it <unk>
closing guantanamo
who's left and what's in the way
the freezing cold cell
the cell door opens
this time the guards push me on the floor and take turns <unk> over my back
i tell the <unk> that i can't face not eating any more
they throw food on the floor of the room and tell me to eat like a pig
they won't let me go to the restroom
they watch as it gets more painful and laugh as they get the <unk> to describe how they will rape me if i <unk> in my <unk>
the freezing cold cell
the cell door opens
they make me stand and <unk> the american flag
i'm in a sort of <unk> room where i have to watch videos of other prisoners being abused
then they tell me that i have to dance for them and run in <unk> whilst they pull on my chains
every time i try and refuse they touch me in my most private areas
the freezing cold cell
the cell door opens
it has <unk> and there are <unk> <unk> everywhere
i'm <unk> so i can't really walk
they deliberately <unk> me through the <unk> <unk>
now it's the <unk> room
awful pictures everywhere
there is one with a man and a <unk>
i'm <unk> naked and have my beard <unk> in a <unk> <unk> to my religion
i'm shown <unk> pictures of women
i'm told to make the <unk> of different animals and when i refuse they just hit me
it ends with them pouring cold water all over me
hours later in my cell i am discovered nearly frozen
the doctor tells them to bring me urgently to the clinic where i am given a blanket and treatment
over the next hours they observe me as i warm up
they are just waiting for the moment that they can sign off on my return to interrogation
four years ago six u.s. government security agencies sat together and reviewed my case
their conclusion
that i was innocent of any crime and should be released
the dirty and <unk> methods i endured which were then taken directly to abu <unk> achieved nothing except to shame that american flag hanging in the prison corridor which i was made to <unk>
one hundred and thirty six prisoners are still being held at guantanamo whilst the politicians <unk> over how to black out the senate report
america can not keep hiding from its past and its present like this
our stories and our continued detention can not be made to disappear

the taliban claimed responsibility for the attack
every week inside africa takes its viewers on a journey across africa exploring the true diversity and depth of different cultures countries and regions
mombasa kenya at the old port in mombasa southern kenya <unk> waters <unk> <unk> against the shore beneath the <unk> fort jesus <unk>
today it's a pretty and peaceful scene but one that <unk> the <unk> <unk> colonial past
it was at this spot just over a century ago that the ancestors of <unk> successful indian community first set foot on african soil
they came in ships and <unk> having been <unk> here to build one of the continent's great <unk>
as that railway which was soon <unk> the <unk> line because of its high cost and the dangers faced by those <unk> it <unk> through the country towards uganda in the years that followed so did the indian community
the economic and cultural roots they laid down beside the tracks remains to this day
in quite a lot said one <unk> of indian heritage we meet in a nearby restaurant
we have <unk> transport and various other things
she tells us her grandfather first came to kenya to work on the <unk> and her family has been there ever since
her colleague <unk> in that indians have been <unk> and economically they play a very big role in the kenyan economy
at a <unk> shop just down the road meanwhile the third generation indian owner tells me that kenyan <unk> are spread widely across industries like construction <unk> and tourism
of course <unk> from india and what's now known as pakistan had come to mombasa long before the railway
the trade routes linking east africa and asia were already well established
mombasa had been a city state for over two thousand years bearing long and <unk> relations with the middle east asia and the far east
in the <unk> <unk> there was <unk> being sold like the way we sell <unk> now or <unk> as we call them said historian <unk> <unk> <unk>
there was rhinoceros horns
there was dry skin there was <unk> all this was happening at this port
it was the railway lines however and the need for labor that first brought a mass migration of people from the sub continent
by the mid one thousand eight hundred and <unk> the british were effectively in control of kenya and were keen to open up the country's interior and that of neighboring uganda to counter german influence in the region
having started construction of railway lines in india nearly fifty years earlier <unk> engineers and <unk> had the skills the british required
more thirty thousand <unk> indian workers were soon <unk> to sail to mombasa and a new life in africa
the country these <unk> migrants found upon arrival however was vastly different to the land of <unk> business opportunity their ancestors <unk> today
work on the <unk> was <unk> hard
by the time it had reached its destination in <unk> on the banks of lake victoria roughly six hundred and twenty five miles from mombasa around two thousand five hundred men had died
that's four people for every mile
and it wasn't just the <unk> heat and long hours workers had to <unk> with
the man <unk> of <unk> were a pair of lions that killed anywhere between twenty eight and more than one hundred workers during the building of the railway depending which account you believe
they spread such terror that work stopped until they were eventually shot
on top of that there was also <unk> and disease to <unk> with
many people died of <unk> and black <unk> when they were building because of the difficult terrain and there were no medical facilities resulting many deaths said <unk> shah whose ancestors settled just outside <unk> after the railway was built
they had to take risks coming to this place she added
shah is one of the many kenyan <unk> who today run their own businesses in the <unk> and <unk> districts of the kenyan capital
she teaches the ancient indian discipline of <unk> a far cry from the <unk> and <unk> work of the railway lines
but the history and contribution of <unk> ancestors in building the community and the infrastructure of the country make her proud of her roots
i would not like to be <unk> as a kenyan from a different region of the world shah said
i am born here and a third generation asian kenyan
i proudly say that i am a kenyan
such open and patriotic sentiments aren't uniform across the country however
outside of the big <unk> such as <unk> and mombasa there is a more complex relationship between communities
in <unk> where the great railway ends issues of integration between kenyan <unk> and black africans remain
although there are rarely tensions between the groups neither <unk> fully with the other
according to local <unk> <unk> <unk> ahmed himself a kenyan asian who married a black kenyan woman this is something that has to change
there has not been a real integration
like in mombasa and <unk> <unk> <unk> ahmed said
in <unk> the integration is only when it's in the shop or at the business
but when they go out of that particular environment there is very little integration either by way of <unk> or other facilities
while kenyan <unk> community makes a substantial economic contribution to wider society ahmed believes they should make more of an effort to mix with their <unk> and <unk> from being <unk>
we are less than one point four percents here in kenya but we hold the <unk> <unk> to maybe thirty percents or forty percents of the economy ahmed estimates
we must remember that if we earn here we live here we must contribute to this country
that's a sentiment that the very first indian <unk> to set foot in this beautiful country would have <unk> agreed with
the national transportation safety board report released december one comes nearly two years after burning and smoking batteries <unk> all fifty of the world's most advanced <unk> flying at the time
when you pick apart the one hundred and ten page document it reveals how any new piece of equipment can pose dangerous problems even a <unk> piece of equipment like batteries
in this situation the battery created one of the worst threats possible
an onboard fire
from a broader perspective the investigation <unk> us of the heavy responsibilities shared by the world's aviation <unk> and aircraft makers
the battery problems struck boeing shortly after it had <unk> out what was then a new model aircraft with some of the most sophisticated technology available
it all started in january two thousand and thirteen when an empty japan airlines seven hundred and eighty seven caught fire while <unk> at <unk> <unk> airport
a second battery incident nine days later in japan prompted the federal aviation administration to ground the entire <unk> fleet while the problem was fixed
read more about the battery
now with more than two hundred <unk> in service the faa says safer battery systems have been installed in the planes
the ntsb basically blamed the battery problem on two things
<unk> from an <unk> short circuit that may have been caused by manufacturing <unk>
allegedly <unk> <unk> of the manufacturing process by both the federal aviation administration and boeing
read the full ntsb report on the battery fire
to bring the investigation into <unk> focus here are eight questions and answers associated with the report
one
what was the root cause of the short circuit
it's remarkable
the investigation was unable to <unk> the root cause of the battery cell short circuit
neither could japanese investigators although they had a theory
two
how closely does the faa monitor the development of aviation technology
the faa allows boeing and other <unk> <unk> to use their own employees to confirm that new aircraft components meet safety regulations
they follow specific faa guidelines and submit to regular checks by faa officials
experts say more and more of that self checking <unk> is moving further down the supply chain to <unk>
ntsb investigators recommended that both the faa and boeing develop or <unk> processes to establish more effective <unk> of suppliers
the report also called on the <unk> japan based battery maker <unk> <unk> <unk> to review its cell manufacturing processes and ensure its employees are properly trained
<unk> quinn a washington based attorney who represents the battery maker said this week that <unk> <unk> had <unk> <unk> with a number of the <unk> ntsb made regarding manufacturing <unk>
he said the company is studying the report and is eager to implement continuous quality improvements with the suggestions of the ntsb faa and japan's aviation <unk>
three
how did all this get started
the battery like those aboard all <unk> was a lithium ion battery a technology that airline <unk> like as a way to save fuel costs because of its low weight
lithium ion batteries also power cell phones and <unk>
it's a developing technology that has a history of <unk> issues
related
watch video of the seven hundred and eighty seven that caught fire in two thousand and thirteen
the faa had already <unk> these batteries as safe and flight <unk>
apparently they weren't
passenger safety and billions of dollars in boeing aircraft orders were at risk
officials needed to know what went wrong
that's why the faa did something next that it hadn't done in more than thirty years
it <unk> an entire type of airliner nationwide
for about four months <unk> sat <unk>
to fix the problem each battery was put inside a <unk> steel box to prevent the battery from catching fire
just in case the box includes <unk> that would force any smoke outside the plane
more <unk> against heat was also added and the batteries were <unk> to charge at lower levels
in the nineteen months since the <unk> fix there have been no reports of batteries catching fire although a seven hundred and eighty seven battery cell did <unk> while on the ground earlier this year
the improvements made to the seven hundred and eighty seven battery system last year appear to have worked as designed boeing told <unk> in a statement at the time
four
could it happen again
boeing and the battery maker say no
t
<unk> if another <unk> battery short <unk> and <unk> the system will remain safe because there won't be enough <unk> in the <unk> box for a fire to be possible a boeing spokeswoman said
does that make the battery maker comfortable with the fact that the root cause of the short circuit remains a mystery
<unk> <unk> is very comfortable in knowing that the quality of the manufacturing processes and the <unk> of the battery will prevent a situation from occurring as it did in the boston and japanese incidents said quinn
five
how important are these batteries anyway
they're necessary but they have <unk> in case they fail
the batteries are used only before take off to power up the cockpit computer and to start the plane's <unk> power unit
after <unk> unless there's a power failure these batteries are not in use because electricity to run onboard equipment is generated by the engines
even if there is a power failure which is highly unlikely there are other ways pilots can create <unk> power to run the seven hundred and eighty <unk> <unk> and other systems
for example small wind turbines called <unk> air turbines or <unk> that pop out of the aircraft to generate <unk> via wind power
six
will boeing and the faa develop a more effective process to <unk> suppliers
boeing says it did that already before the ntsb report
the company said it now has a more formal flow of requirements and increased interaction between boeing its suppliers and sub <unk> suppliers as compared to the processes in place earlier
the faa said it also has effective processes in place to identify and correct issues that emerged before and after <unk> of the seven hundred and eighty seven
but it also said it's still <unk> the ntsb <unk> and will provide a timely response to the board
seven
do airliner <unk> plan to use lithium ion batteries on new aircraft models
immediately after the <unk> <unk> boeing <unk> airbus announced it was pulling lithium ion batteries from early production models of its new a three hundred and fifty aircraft and going with traditional and heavier <unk> <unk> batteries
but in september airbus did a one hundred and eighty
it said it planned to <unk> back to lithium ion batteries on a three hundred and fifty s set to be delivered in two thousand and sixteen
airbus chief designer told <unk> the company can mitigate any risks to zero
boeing said this week it would decide whether to use lithium ion batteries in new planes on a case by case basis
eight
were there any <unk> in the report
yes
a random unrelated problem with a new type of cockpit voice recorder
the report revealed that a new recorder on the japan airlines <unk> didn't record voices very well a situation that could <unk> future aircraft investigations the ntsb said
almost all crew conversations recorded by the cockpit voice recorder were completely <unk> by <unk> cockpit noise according to the report
the faa should require boeing to improve the quality of the audio on the recording device the ntsb said
boeing said it's still examining the ntsb <unk>
overall for aviation <unk> and fans of the <unk> the report offered a mountain of <unk> data about the popular aircraft
as quinn the <unk> <unk> attorney put it i think we can all rest assured that this is the most investigated battery incident ever
but a day after his death the two sides continued to offer <unk> accounts of what killed him
palestinians say that autopsy results show that abu ein died from a harsh blow to his <unk> and <unk> that excessive use of force in conjunction with the <unk> of tear gas were contributing factors
palestinian minister of civil affairs hussein al sheikh told the palestinian <unk> news agency on thursday that doctors from palestinian territories jordan and israel participated in the autopsy
he said that while israeli doctors admitted the results they did not sign the medical report
on the other hand a preliminary autopsy report issued by the israeli government said abu ein's death was caused by a <unk> of the <unk> <unk> because of <unk>
stress could have caused the bleeding the report said suggesting the poor condition of abu ein's heart caused him to be more sensitive to stress
cnn spoke to dr. ahmed <unk> at the ramallah medical complex who ruled out ninety nine point nine nine percents that abu ein's death was brought on by a heart attack
<unk> the director general of the hospital said the cause of death was <unk>
that abu ein <unk> to death on his own <unk> brought on by gas <unk>
abu ein died after clashes with israeli soldiers <unk> wednesday in the palestinian village of <unk> which is northeast of the west bank city of ramallah
he was a minister in the <unk> party and head of the committee to resist the wall and settlements and he was participating in <unk> demonstrations to mark international human rights day longtime chief palestinian negotiator <unk> <unk> said in a statement
pictures from various news agencies depict an israeli soldier with his hands to abu ein's neck followed by another showing him on the ground
the official palestinian news agency <unk> meanwhile reported that the palestinian official lost <unk> after he <unk> tear gas and an israeli soldier hit him in the chest
the israeli soldiers called abu ein by name and seemed to be focused on him witness <unk> abu <unk> told cnn
there was a lot of pushing kicking and punching by the soldiers
when abu ein tried to <unk> they hit him on the chest with a rifle <unk> and grabbed him by the throat and pushed him back and then threw a large amount of tear gas and <unk> grenades
israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu said israel will investigate the death
declaring three days of mourning palestinian authority president mahmoud abbas slammed abu ein's death as an <unk> barbaric act according to <unk>
what happened is a crime by all means we can not sit <unk> and silent this crime he said later on palestinian television
for that this leadership is meeting now to decide what it wants and i say <unk> all options are open for discussion and for implementation
we don't have any other solutions
on thursday thousands of palestinian mourners marched in abu ein's funeral procession as he was taken from the presidential compound to a cemetery

down came the rows of colorful tents that had populated a stretch of highway running through the heart of the city's financial district
down came the works of protest art that had <unk> up during the occupation including the <unk> <unk> umbrella sculptures
police dragged out the last remaining demonstrators one by one and by nine forty five p.m. had cleared them all
both <unk> of <unk> road which has been occupied for weeks were open and traffic was back to normal within two hours
police finished clearing the area in the span of a day
a small protest site remained in <unk> bay not far from the <unk> road area but police warned protesters that if they moved to that area arrests would be made
the clearance of the site <unk> the end of more than ten weeks of street demonstrations that challenged china's communist ruled government and captured the world's attention
the protests blocked off parts of the city for weeks led to <unk> clashes and appeared to serve as a political awakening for many young hong kong citizens
after <unk> <unk> <unk> at the site following a court <unk> requested by a bus company waves of police officers moved in

the protest site next to the city's government headquarters had once drawn tens of thousands of people

many people had packed up and left before the deadline set by authorities
if it's a test of force there's no possibility that we can win said <unk> <unk> a twenty one year old protester who vowed to stay until the end
the chinese government which has ultimate control over hong kong has steadfastly rejected the protesters demand for open elections in the territory calling the street occupation illegal and letting local authorities deal with the situation on the ground
in recent weeks divisions have <unk> among different groups within the protest movement numbers have <unk> and public support for the street occupations has fallen away
but demonstrators have said that even after the protest site is cleared they will continue their campaign
we will be back read some signs around the site before the clearance started
it's just the beginning warned another
we'll do more civil <unk> actions
we'll go talk to local communities <unk> said
leaders of the student groups that have <unk> the demonstrations said they would remain at the main protest site but wouldn't physically resist the police

days after the world of athletics was hit by serious doping allegations the sport has been accused of covering up how it dealt with scores of suspicious blood samples
in the two years between two thousand and six and two thousand and eight the body in charge of global athletics failed to examine as many as one hundred and fifty samples from several countries according to a report broadcast by a german network monday
this was a period before widespread changes were introduced to anti doping procedures
the allegations reported by german tv station <unk> came less than a week after german broadcaster <unk> <unk> aired an hour long <unk> documenting russia's alleged <unk> use of banned <unk>
as with last week's documentary <unk> released an english transcript after <unk> the report
the international association of athletics <unk> is now investigating those claims but the governing body now finds itself under the <unk>
during monday's edition of the sport inside a former member of the <unk> medical commission who is not identified said the samples in question were from athletes representing spain kenya greece germany morocco russia and at least one from britain
just take a look the <unk> values how they have risen in only four months by thirty eight percents and in the next four months they have fallen again by sixteen percents the official explains according to the english translation of the documentary provided by the broadcaster to cnn
it's obvious that there's something wrong there
that simply can not be
it is absolutely clear to see and <unk> simply can not be explained
this can only be doping
president of <unk> athletics federation jose maria <unk> said his organization received no <unk> of any suspicious samples from the iaaf
when we receive information of that type we immediately carry out surprise doping tests on the suspicious athletes <unk> said in an email sent to cnn
he also outlined that spanish track athletes are required to supply their blood passport a method used to monitor any potential doping violations a week before competition
both british athletics and uk anti doping have declined to comment while both the russian athletics federation and russian anti doping agency have so far failed to <unk> to cnn's request for comment
the iaaf insisted tuesday that the english transcript of the documentary would be passed on directly to its independent ethics commission
it also said that a member of the iaaf medical and anti doping commission would not know whether follow up tests would have been conducted or not
the athlete biological passport program was launched in two thousand and nine ensuring <unk> blood samples were stored <unk> and monitored over time according to the iaaf
samples collected prior to two thousand and nine according to the iaaf do not have the same level of <unk> and strength as the post two thousand and nine values which were collected under strict and <unk> conditions
the governing body also stated that any samples taken before two thousand and nine were only used as <unk> evidence or to arrange <unk> follow up <unk> tests
the iaaf also insists that <unk> results were <unk> followed up by the iaaf <unk> possible <unk>
<unk> the world's anti doping agency said it would investigate the allegations in a statement released on tuesday
last week's <unk> <unk> documentary had already alleged <unk> doping in russian athletics
it claimed russian officials covered up positive results in exchange for financial reward
the russian anti doping agency announced it would investigate the allegations while the president of the country's athletics federation told reuters the claims were a pack of lies
paton walsh described his experiences including meeting a group of children who played in a makeshift <unk> and <unk> under <unk> to protect themselves from isis shelling in an ask me anything <unk> on <unk>
here are the highlights from the <unk> conversation
some of the posts have been <unk> for <unk> and <unk>
i'm sure you saw and experienced a lot of devastating things in your time over there
what was the most heartbreaking thing you saw
do you think outside foreign involvement over there is having more of a positive or negative impact on the people
asked <unk>
paton walsh
the kids in their <unk> shelter is always tough
i also remember a bomb shelter some kids made two years ago now in a refugee camp in <unk> al <unk>
they were literally <unk> a cave with their hands
foreign help comes in many forms
isis have some foreigners
the turkish are just across the border but the kurds claim they are <unk> <unk>
the iraqi kurdish peshmerga help a lot with heavy weapons
and the coalition airstrikes also keep isis back and have helped the kurds hang on
but in the end the sheer <unk> of outside parties now with stakes in the fight for the town means that it will go on a long time
<unk> nick amazing report from kobani how long were you there and how did you get in
asked <unk>
paton walsh
thanks
we were there just under forty eight hours
i can't really say much about how we got in it was a mix of simple and complicated but we are grateful to the kurds for their hospitality and care
what's the current situation for journalists there
interested to know about how you get your stories out how you manage the day to day
asked <unk>
thank you in advance
paton walsh
it is complicated
anyone attempting entry should spend weeks thinking about it and not file until out
day to day you need the full invitation and hospitality of the kurds to operate in any way
did you feel safe under the kurds care and hospitality
asked <unk>
paton walsh
yes as safe as one can there
you probably aren't allowed to answer this but i'll ask <unk>
how does your personal understanding and experience being there seeing things and working there <unk> from what is ultimately reported
perhaps it doesn't
or maybe it does
in either case i am <unk> to hear your thoughts
and thanks for taking the time to do this <unk>
asked <unk>
paton walsh
it's the same
there isn't some process by which we see and feel a lot of things that we then ignore and follow a <unk> <unk>
you see what we do
i know that's hard to believe in this social media age of <unk> <unk> but it's true
did you interview any isis members
asked <unk> twenty three
paton walsh
the nature of isis means that in person you are unlikely or ill advised to interview them
social media interaction and <unk> are possible and my colleagues have managed that
the kurds did not have any isis prisoners at the time we were inside kobani
thank you and your team for being professionals and risking your lives for the story
did you meet any foreign nationals fighting for the kurdish side
is there any truth to the reports of isis getting <unk> from the turkish side of the border
how effective do you think are the allied airstrikes on isis
and last but not least have you ever touched wolf <unk> beard
again thank you
paton walsh
no no foreign nationals
we were told there may be some but saw none
isis are not as far as we can see getting any <unk> the turkish are in a <unk> as they are both <unk> trying to not end up in an open fight with isis whilst securing their own borders
the coalition airstrikes are being effective in terms of denying isis the chance to take all of kobani
the strikes have also meant isis have had to <unk> in and lose fighters and equipment
they can't finish the fight off though
that will take better <unk> for the kurds
<unk> nick
what do you see as the best solution for the situation in syria right now
any ideas how to remove assad from power
asked <unk> twenty two
paton walsh
you can't tackle isis without also addressing the reason why such extremism has a <unk> the three years of <unk> of <unk> that assad forces <unk>
but an overall solution for syria is outside of the resources the u.s. wants to commit at this point
there are also too many other players who want an opposite outcome iran russia
the u.s. should be and perhaps has been <unk> that their increased presence like ground troops has often become the lightning rod for all anger adding a new problem rather than <unk> the original one
in end syria is going to be a conflict that <unk> of itself
one key problem is that this war has become a <unk> conflict for many sides and keeps expanding dragging in iraq and more different militias
so the point in which the combatants get <unk> keeps staying out of reach
it will take a <unk> <unk> event that <unk> serious international action or more likely <unk> <unk> to stop this war
what are your thoughts on the cia isis torture videos released yesterday
do you think the videos will provoke isis to <unk> their attacks on u.s. soil
also from your perspective how concerned should we be in <unk> to isis growth
the news reports they're growing rapidly was this evident during your time in syria
paton walsh
isis grew most rapidly when they were not on the global radar and then when they ran into iraq taking mosul
since then their <unk> have been <unk>
they haven't had the huge <unk> win they need for recruitment the constant forward motion that many analysts say makes them <unk> to future recruits
they are growing in terms of infrastructure and organization perhaps but not <unk> reach if you <unk> a handful of <unk> of allegiance in other countries that are <unk> worrying but not game <unk>
does isis <unk> actually consider the term <unk> as offensive
i have only seen the one report by residents in mosul saying that the fighters and leadership see it as offensive
will <unk> them across all fronts actually do anything
thanks
paton walsh
i don't think <unk> them <unk> makes any difference
it might <unk> <unk> those who watch french politicians on tv
but in the end a slightly more <unk> strategy is required than <unk> name calling
if you could tell the american public just one thing about isis what would it be
asked <unk>

cnn
where has this knowledge of <unk> cosmetics come from
ab
my father was a <unk> and my grandfather was a <unk> i tried to <unk> all those things that when i was young they sent me to the bush to collect
the <unk> that we have here have a real <unk> of <unk>
and when i started using them too i have realized that i didn't choose the wrong way of <unk> people
cnn
you had been working as a taxi driver since you dropped out of school
why the sudden need to mix things up
ab
when i found that my children were growing up i told one of my taxi clients that i had to find something to do so that i would be able to look after my children very well
and he himself told me they needed to send someone to britain to go and learn how to operate printing a press
he sent me there i learned and came back and they opened a printing press for me in <unk>
cnn
then after the printing press came a stint in japan
ab
they gave me the opportunity to go and i traveled to japan where i started odd jobs
i came back with about five buses and started a transport business but unfortunately for me it was all accidents one after the other
cnn
after all these accidents you didn't give up though
you transformed one of the buses into a mobile grocery delivery service right
ab
what i was doing was going to the villages buying food <unk> buying everything needed in the kitchen and coming to the residential areas and announcing the things that i had to sell
it was a very lucrative job
i did it for some time and i saw that the work was so <unk> because sometimes i had to go to the bush myself carry the <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> and that stuff by myself and age was catching up with me
so i decided that this work i can't do it for long because if age caught up with me i can't go to the bush to carry those food <unk> so i decided to try another thing
cnn
so where did the name <unk> come from
ab
this name <unk> is in the memory of a dear friend who has passed on
that name <unk> was a <unk> between us
cnn
and how did you know <unk> skin care products would take off the way they did
ab
i went to the market and bought <unk> that are <unk> and produced by foreign countries <unk> and <unk> and went around announcing those things for sale and it was really doing very well
cnn
so you decided to start producing locally and it's been quite the success
has it been an easy ride
ab
the economy is always <unk>
you know we haven't got a permanent exchange rate for our currency
i'm an <unk> i produce other products but some things <unk> and <unk> <unk> and that sort of stuff
we import them so at the time of <unk> you <unk> based on the exchange rate before the goods would arrive in the country sometimes the exchange rate would shoot <unk>
cnn
you seem to face these obstacles head on and industry leaders have noticed
how did it feel to be honored as the overall entrepreneur of the year in april
ab
as somebody who started from nowhere if i am in this area and being recognized that i am the entrepreneur of the year obviously i <unk> this the most
it means they are <unk> what i am doing so i was very happy
cnn
and after receiving these honors you're also trying the pay it forward <unk> by helping build schools and provide computers in classrooms
ab
i'm not educated but i'm always happy when i see children in school
you know here in africa it's not all people who get the opportunity to go to school
education is a lost treasure for every human being
that is why i'm always passionate even if i did not get the change to educate myself very well
now that allah has given me that power everywhere that i see that need for education if it is in my power i help them
cnn
last question what advice do you have for any <unk> <unk>
ab
nobody should think that because they didn't go to a classroom to sit on a chair i'm not educated
we can always educate ourselves wherever we go
that is a <unk> way of life
whatever dreams that we have we should think that it's human beings who can do anything in this world
opinion
<unk> should have a voice too

it included an mh sixty five helicopter an <unk> one hundred and thirty airplane and the one hundred and ten foot coast guard <unk> <unk>
but none of them could find ron ingraham or his boat
on december one the coast guard called off its search

but i had a <unk> on me <unk> myself back in ingraham said
from there he had no choice but to go where the current took him
searchers had struggled to find him because weather pulled him hundreds of miles away from the area where they'd been looking he said
i was way out there and i was out of water but i <unk> on fish he said
i'm a fisherman so i caught fish
it wasn't as a good as a <unk> bar he said
but it was how he survived
he's alive after twelve days at sea his son zakary ingraham said
i couldn't be <unk>

it would seem that publication by the senate intelligence committee of its report into the torture of detainees just brought a <unk> of trouble
the republican chairman of the house intelligence committee mike <unk> told cnn that publication was a terrible idea and said foreign leaders have approached the government and said you do this this will cause violence and deaths
he was not alone on <unk> a <unk> global reaction
but reaction from overseas has been for the most part <unk> both among the united states allies and its enemies
none of the major al qaeda affiliates had sought to exploit the often graphic details of the report
the pan arab tv networks focused on a meeting of the gulf co operation council rather than <unk> of live coverage out of washington
for sure social media lit up and there were plenty of comments from the muslim world
one of hundreds of similar tweets read this is only what the <unk> are <unk> to the public after hiding for many years
can you even imagine what they are still hiding
but the dense text and <unk> were not as <unk> nor as easily <unk> as images from abu <unk> prison of <unk> abuse cartoons of the prophet mohammed or video of the <unk> being burnt
and the story of enhanced interrogation techniques by the cia was hardly new even if some of the techniques were
heavily redacted the report <unk> none of the countries there are thought to have been at least eight where cia interrogation took place nor other forms of co operation from allies in the rendition program
in britain a conservative member of parliament andrew <unk> told the daily telegraph
it's impossible to tell how much the report has been redacted or reduced cut to take out the extent of the involvement of other countries in particular america's closest ally the united kingdom
in a two hundred and sixteen page report published last year the open society justice initiative a new york based human rights organization said that secret detention and extraordinary rendition operations designed to be conducted outside the united states under cover of <unk> could not have been implemented without the active participation of foreign governments

in an echo of warnings that followed the publication of tens of thousands of us diplomatic <unk> by <unk> <unk> said that publication of the report meant that the us might lose its ability to have effective intelligence cooperation with allies
everything that has been happening in recent days is significantly <unk> the feeling in many places around the world about the weakness of the usa he said
trust even in your closest ally must be limited
<unk> added that he believed the report was an unexpected christmas present for the kremlin which is locked in <unk> combat with washington on a range of issues
besides poland cases against <unk> and <unk> also said to have hosted black sites are pending before the european court
as <unk> to u.s. international standing as the report may seem right now supporters of publication say it demonstrates that the u.s. <unk> and owns up to its mistakes as it did with the abu <unk> scandal
<unk> <unk> <unk> who chairs the intelligence committee and was the driving force for the report's publication said it showed the spirit of a just society that <unk> under law and that when we make mistakes we admit them we correct them and we move on
the same sentiment came from the white house and from paris where the french foreign ministry said the main objective of the international community must stay within the framework of respect for human rights and international humanitarian law
in london british prime minister david cameron said the report's publication was a reminder that we won't succeed if we lose our moral authority if we lose the things that make our systems work and countries successful

britain is still waiting for its <unk> report on iraq

the united states has a long history of <unk> torture in any form or for any purpose
president <unk> <unk> sent the u.n. convention against torture to the us senate in one thousand nine hundred and eighty eight asking it to <unk> an abhorrent practice
it was <unk> in the early days of the george <unk> bush administration
but years later during the administration of his son president george w. bush consistently argued that enhanced interrogation techniques as they were <unk> known did not amount to torture
but the revelations included in the senate report leave little doubt that at least some of the practices would by all international standards be defined as torture
many on both sides of the <unk> have since spoken of the moral <unk> involved in pushing the boundaries of interrogation and the consequences for american leadership
the senate armed services committee concluded in two thousand and eight that u.s. leadership on combating torture helps to build democratic societies and institutions abroad where often torture is used to <unk> and destroy democratic freedoms

in two thousand and two he wrote to the <unk> to president george w. bush that if the <unk> were ignored europeans and others will likely have legal problems with extradition or other forms of cooperation in law enforcement including in bringing terrorists to justice
there would be a high cost in terms of negative international reaction with immediate <unk> consequences for our conduct of foreign policy he said
<unk> lost the internal debate but the conclusions of the nine eleven commission suggested his advice should have been <unk>
the commission said that allegations that the united states abused prisoners in its custody make it harder to build the diplomatic political and military <unk> the government will need and recommended that the united states engage its friends to develop a common coalition approach toward the detention and <unk> treatment of captured terrorists
that has not happened according to the constitution <unk> task force on <unk> treatment whose members included former u.s
under secretary of state thomas pickering and former fbi director william <unk>
it reported last year that the u.s. had failed to take meaningful permanent steps to find a common approach on the <unk> treatment and detention of suspected terrorists
and it echoed the <unk> recommendation that the u.s. draw on article three of the geneva <unk> on the law of armed conflict
pickering whose diplomatic career <unk> five decades said he hoped the report would be a vital <unk> in opening the door to new legislation in congress that would <unk> the ban on torture

if they can influence u.s. policy by threatening u.s. embassies and personnel then we've lost the game pickering told cnn

the u.n. special <unk> on counter terrorism and human rights ben <unk> said there must also be prosecutions
the individuals responsible for the criminal conspiracy revealed in the report must be brought to justice and must face criminal <unk> <unk> with the <unk> of their crimes

amnesty international agreed saying that prosecution is not a policy <unk> it is a <unk> under international law while human rights watch executive director <unk> <unk> said that torture would remain a policy option for future presidents unless officials were <unk>
pickering has mixed feelings about prosecutions
federal officials take an oath to <unk> the constitution but many were assured they were acting <unk>
and he is no fan of going down what he called the latin american route <unk> one president puts his predecessor in jail
some people do need to be held to account because some of the conduct is so widely at odds with our values he said

both president obama and the u.s. justice department have made it clear that they oppose prosecutions
thomas pickering wishes the transparency shown by publication of the senate report had been applied eleven years ago when the office of legal <unk> drew up its controversial <unk> one of which concluded that federal laws against torture assault and <unk> would not apply to the overseas interrogation of terror suspects

a judge in <unk> ruled wednesday that south african prosecutors can appeal <unk> pistorius conviction but denied the state's bid to challenge his sentence
the decision means that the decision over pistorius fate isn't over with the legal battle possibly <unk> well into next year
prosecutors had said pistorius sentence of five years in prison for <unk> shooting his girlfriend was nowhere near enough punishment
they also want the double <unk> track star to be convicted of a more serious charge
they had originally sought conviction on a charge of murder
pistorius was found guilty of culpable homicide or <unk> killing in the death of <unk> steenkamp
the athlete didn't attend the hearing which began tuesday but his father <unk> was present
i don't think we should have gone this far he told reporters as he left the <unk>
this is what we wanted
this is what we wanted said <unk> <unk> a spokesman for the national prosecuting authority
the issues that we wanted <unk> are issues of law and of course the judge agreed with our arguments

prosecutors argued that judge <unk> masipa <unk> a complex south african standard defining a technical form of intent that proved to be a central aspect of the case according to cnn legal analyst kelly phelps

after a video of the gay wedding spread across egyptian social media the men were arrested and eventually sentenced to three years in prison for <unk> <unk> material
homosexuality is not mentioned in the egyptian <unk> code and <unk> it is not illegal but members of the lgbt community are often arrested and charged with <unk> prostitution or <unk>
at least twenty <unk> and transgender persons were convicted of <unk> and other charges in two thousand and fourteen which human rights activists say has been the worst year for the community in recent memory
fear of arrest and social stigma force the majority of the lgbt community to <unk> their identity and sexual orientation
you have to be aware of everything you're doing
your clothes your reactions toward people <unk> told cnn
he has asked us not to use his real name to protect his identity
both dominant religions in egypt islam and christianity <unk> homosexuality
rather than the <unk> translation the word usually used for homosexuality in arabic is <unk> meaning <unk>
this category is wide enough to <unk> together homosexuals and transgender people as one in both media reports and court cases
a video posted on a popular news <unk> last may showed five people after their arrest at a residential apartment
their faces like their bodies barely covered
two weeks later they were sentenced to twelve seven and four years in prison
among the charges they faced was that of using the internet to spread <unk>
the police would make the defendants go through their contacts and the pictures they post on dating apps and social media to use them as evidence against them and get information on others says <unk> abd <unk> gender and women's rights officer at the egyptian initiative for personal rights
earlier this year a group of rights activists reached out to gay dating websites urging them to issue safety warnings to their egyptian users
<unk> a gay dating application warned their egyptian users that police may be posing as lgbt on social media to <unk> you
in september <unk> announced that locations would be hidden by <unk> for users in countries such as egypt saudi arabia and russia which have a history of prosecuting those from the lgbt community
i'm always afraid if i meet someone and he is from the government then i'll get arrested like other people <unk> said
such fears <unk> both the <unk> of having one's identity revealed and the prospect of coming face to face with an unclear judicial procedure
the <unk> in such court cases abd <unk> said were often <unk>
take the wedding case for example
the judge cleared them of the <unk> charges yet he sentenced them to three years for filming and <unk> <unk> material even though he ruled that there was no <unk> involved
a forensic report from the court found that the men hadn't engaged in <unk> intercourse
i think the police will not treat them as humans
this is a very big problem in egypt said <unk> dr. <unk> abu <unk>
he says he supports gay rights but he also has another view
my thought about this is that this is something that can be changed can be <unk> says abu <unk>
of course there are those who can not be <unk> but we have had many <unk> with the treatment
that view is widely <unk> by leading <unk> experts in the west
in two thousand and nine the american psychological association recommended that specialists avoid telling clients that sexual orientation is <unk> through therapy or other forms of treatment
it warned of the potential for harm <unk> the lack of proof that such types of therapy can lead to a permanent change in sexual orientation
contrary to claims of sexual orientation change advocates and <unk> there is <unk> evidence to support the use of psychological <unk> to change sexual orientation said <unk> <unk> <unk> chair of the task force that created the <unk> report
abu <unk> claims those expert findings are the result of pressure from the lgbt lobby

what needs to happen is there needs to be an official voice for gay people in egypt ahmed not his real name told cnn
in private more <unk> men and women are coming out to their families in egypt to varying reactions <unk> said
but in the public <unk> the situation is more <unk>
lgbt activists say they find their work more difficult than their human rights counterparts in other fields who are already <unk> for a potential government crackdown on civil society particularly organizations working on human rights
the activists themselves run a double risk both because of their choice of field and by <unk> their identity as members of the lgbt community says abd <unk>
the solidarity with egypt lgbt campaign was launched earlier this year but an online petition against the imprisonment of homosexuals in egypt received just two hundred and sixteen <unk> in six months
ahmed would like to see an organization recognized by the government to advocate on the behalf of the lgbt community
he believes this would greatly improve their situation
but with the ministry of religious <unk> an influential government agency condemning homosexuality many see little prospect for change
there is no room for dialogue that is my problem with egypt
it is like i want you to ask me about it and i will tell you and maybe you'll understand he says
until that time comes egypt's <unk> and <unk> will remain in the <unk>
<unk> there could be an uprising
but the whole country would back the mass killings of homosexuals
the whole country would <unk> it under the <unk> they would be behind the violence that's the problem ahmed said

i was not completely <unk> <unk> said

this is the guy who will decide whether you stay or go home
in the days before the meeting the investigator and the interpreter made merrill write out what he would say

i did not try to <unk> the language
i wanted it clearly understood by those outside north korea that these were not my words though in my <unk>
the meeting took place on november nine two thousand and thirteen in a large room on the ground floor of the <unk> hotel where <unk> was being held
merrill was wearing a short <unk> shirt but the interpreter told him that was not formal enough so he changed to a long <unk> one
merrill was <unk> to be very respectful to stand up when the official entered the room and then to read the statement
the official appeared to be in his fifty s wearing a well <unk> uniform with a serious formal <unk>
with video cameras rolling and his hands shaking merrill began
during the korean war i have been guilty of a long list of <unk> crimes
as i killed so many civilians and <unk> korean people's army soldiers and destroyed strategic objects in the dprk during the korean war i committed <unk> offensive acts against the dprk government and korean people
although sixty years have gone by i came to dprk on the excuse of the tour

so it seems an <unk> perhaps that the city should be host to the first gallery in the uae and possibly the middle east dedicated to the art of the spray can
not so says thomas perreaux forest partner in the <unk> <unk> street art gallery in one of dubai's more <unk> suburbs
the <unk> smart <unk> well educated is in some ways an unlikely champion of such a <unk> genre
he's the kind of <unk> citizen you might expect to <unk> youths armed with spray <unk>
he says the art form goes way beyond graffiti however
his gallery in dubai's <unk> neighborhood appears to support his theory offering spray painted works an unlikely home in a country largely <unk> of graffiti and attracting healthy prices
work at recent <unk> has been <unk> up to and <unk> of ten thousand dollar
at any one time there are about one hundred pieces on show with <unk> changing at least once a month
perreaux forest forty three and fellow founder and <unk> stephane <unk> forty five knew there would be demand after their shared passion for street art led them to a surprising discovery in the united states
we realized when we were going to gallery <unk> here in dubai that we couldn't really see what we enjoyed and when we found it it was quite <unk> says perreaux forest
then we were talking to <unk> in miami and new york and france and those guys were telling us that people from dubai came over there to buy <unk>
this made us think
why not open a gallery
people who are interested in this cross the atlantic so it proves there is demand
it was still a gamble because it is hard to do a market study but the feedback as soon as we opened was absolutely amazing
first show <unk> goes dubai celebrated a miami district where street artists are free to spray paint without <unk> from police
it's a very creative place
there's a big street artist community there and during our last trip we met lots of artists and signed ten male and female from miami some from new york and la
that exhibition was a <unk> <unk> of their work

swiss born and now dubai based <unk> brought possibly the most controversial work inspired by <unk> street protest in addition to a decorated <unk> of wall that he has on permanent display in the gallery

<unk> <unk> street art with arabic writing given a modern <unk> by local talent
we took the opportunity of ramadan to do something about the art of writing adds perreaux forest
here in the region arab <unk> is very important and is a real art form in itself
there is an evolution in this particular art
on the other side the graffiti started with <unk> guys signing or <unk> streets or trains
so it was interesting to mix those arts of writing the <unk> but modern <unk> with the writing in graffiti a mix of ancient and modern
and we managed to find some <unk> that do much more modern pieces than we're used to seeing in <unk> around the region
some were very close to street art
it proved an exciting glimpse into where dubai could go with the genre and <unk> out some indigenous potential
we would be very keen to display more local street artists adds perreaux forest when asked whether he plans to showcase and <unk> some of that native talent

for the moment we are focusing on established artists but a bit of what we do is to help the local scene and raise the level says perreaux forest
it's good to visit a gallery to meet experienced artists to improve your style and work and that's what i believe is needed here
street art is not allowed anywhere but it can be <unk> in western countries
here it is not really the case and we don't want graffiti all over the place
but one of our missions is to help the local guys and to make local culture and people from the region understand that street art is not about <unk> and that there are many different <unk> in street art

the majority report issued by the senate intelligence committee is a <unk> condemnation of the tactics branded by critics as torture the george w. bush administration deployed in the fear laden days after the september eleven two thousand and one terrorist attacks
the techniques according to the report were deeply <unk> <unk> managed and often resulted in fabricated information
the report is <unk> the <unk> <unk> over combating terrorism that dominated washington a decade ago
democrats argue the tactics conflict with american values while leading members of the bush administration insist they were vital to preventing another attack
the cia immediately hit back at the report saying in a statement that the program was effective and <unk> helped its understanding of al qaeda's tactical operations and goals
but president barack obama said the report <unk> his view that the harsh interrogation methods were not only <unk> with our values as a nation they did not serve our broader counterterrorism efforts or our national security interests
in its most graphic details an executive summary of the report finds that conditions for detainees at top secret overseas interrogation sites were much harsher than the cia has previously admitted
it finds that high value detainees were subjected to methods like <unk> and sleep <unk> in near <unk> fashion for days or weeks at a time
in many cases the most aggressive techniques were used immediately in combination and <unk> the report says
sleep <unk> involved keeping detainees <unk> for up to one hundred and eighty hours usually standing or in painful stress positions at times with their hands <unk> above their heads
in one facility a <unk> was said to have died of <unk> after being held partially <unk> and <unk> to a concrete floor while at other times naked prisoners were <unk> and dragged up and down <unk> while being slapped and punched
multiple cia detainees subjected to the techniques suffered from <unk> <unk> <unk> and tried to <unk> themselves the report says
on one occasion high value al qaeda suspect abu <unk> became completely <unk> after a period of intense <unk>
he had <unk> rising through his open full mouth the report says
meanwhile the confessed mastermind of the september eleven attacks <unk> <unk> mohammed was subjected to a series of near <unk>
the report finds that at least one hundred and nineteen detainees went through the cia detention program and at least twenty six were held <unk> partly because there was no information to justify their detention
previously the cia had said only one hundred prisoners had been <unk> through the program democratic senate aides said
the report suggests that the controversial enhanced interrogation techniques did not produce information necessary to save lives that was not already available from other means
that is important because supporters of the program have always said that it was vital to <unk> <unk> intelligence from detainees that could not be <unk> through conventional <unk>
it also <unk> cia claims in two thousand and eleven that enhanced interrogation of al qaeda operative hassan <unk> produced information which led them to osama bin <unk> <unk> abu ahmad al <unk>
the breakthrough which eventually helped the agency track down the al qaeda <unk> <unk> in <unk> pakistan was <unk> before <unk> was subjected to harsh treatment the report said
in its <unk> response to the report released even before senate intelligence committee <unk> <unk> <unk> rose on the senate floor to <unk> it the cia said it was <unk> whether it could have received the same information from terror suspects using alternative methods
it said the conclusions of the report contained too many <unk> for it to stand as official record of the program and said many of the charges were based on <unk> <unk> analysis of the value of the intelligence obtained from the detainees
obama <unk> enhanced interrogation techniques soon after becoming president in two thousand and nine and admitted in august we <unk> some <unk>
as commander in chief he faces many of the same <unk> on how to fight terrorism as his predecessor
but the tone of his response to the report was nevertheless critical
he acknowledged in his statement that the bush administration had faced <unk> choices about how to pursue al qaeda and prevent additional terrorist attacks against our country
our nation did many things right in those difficult years
at the same time some of the actions that were taken were contrary to our values
<unk> said that the cia's actions in the aftermath of nine eleven were a <unk> on our values and on our history
the release of this five hundred page summary can not remove that <unk> but it can and does say to our people and the world that america is big enough to admit when it's wrong and confident enough to learn from its mistakes she said
in april three republicans on the intelligence committee voted to <unk> the report
but <unk> sen. <unk> <unk> the committee's top gop member also released a minority <unk> to the document taking issues with its <unk> and findings
the <unk> said the report created the false <unk> that the cia was actively <unk> policy makers and <unk> the counterterrorism efforts of other federal government agencies during the <unk> operation
director of national intelligence james <unk> said he did not believe that any other nation would go to the <unk> the united states does to bare its soul admit mistakes when they are made and learn from those mistakes
thousands of <unk> at u.s. diplomatic posts and military bases around the world are on alert amid fears the graphic details of how detainees were treated could <unk> a violent backlash
but there was little initial interest on jihadi <unk> about the report said <unk> <unk> a senior analyst at <unk> partners a u.s. organization that tracks jihadi websites
intelligence sources told cnn's pentagon correspondent barbara <unk> however that the threat of <unk> attacks could come in days rather than hours as information <unk> across the world
those sources added that currently there is no specific threat
the full report is more than six thousand pages long
but after a prolonged <unk> between the cia and the committee over how much of the material should be <unk> the document being released tuesday is four hundred and eighty pages long
senior members of the bush administration have also voiced <unk> that the report is being released and defended their actions those of administration lawyers and cia agents charged with the <unk>
former president george w. bush told cnn's <unk> <unk> last week that the united states was fortunate to have men and women who work hard at the cia serving on our behalf
these are <unk>
these are good people
really good people
former vice president <unk> cheney told the new york times that claims that the cia was out of <unk> or that the interrogation program was a <unk> operations were a bunch of <unk>
the program was authorized
the agency did not want to <unk> without <unk> and it was also reviewed <unk> by the justice department before they <unk> the program cheney said
countries that <unk> with the cia hosting black site prisons and assisting in <unk> detainees are identified only <unk> and not by name
cia employees referred to by <unk> in the report aren't being identified
however the agency pushed for the <unk> to be redacted because other information in the report could be used to determine who the employees are
for some republicans and cia supporters there's still a dispute about whether techniques such as <unk> <unk> torture
the justice department twice has investigated the conduct of cia employees involved in the program and decided not to bring charges

prosecutor <unk> <unk> called for a minimum sentence of ten years
if judge masipa sides with the prosecution on tuesday the case will go to the supreme court of appeals in <unk> which will then hear the appeal itself opening the door to the possibility of a harsher sentence

at the height of his power zhou <unk> controlled police forces spy agencies court systems and prosecution offices across china and the domestic security <unk> wasn't shy in <unk> his vast assets to crush dissent and unrest in the name of preserving social stability
during his reign before <unk> in two thousand and twelve as worsening income inequality and official corruption fueled mass <unk> nationwide zhou <unk> the domestic security budget <unk> to <unk> that of the two million strong chinese military the world's largest
as a member of the ruling communist party's politburo standing committee china's top decision making body zhou was one of nine men who effectively ruled the country of more than one point three billion people
away from the spotlight though zhou and his family members were reportedly taking advantage of his leadership position to <unk> enormous wealth
the allegedly <unk> exchange between money and power as revealed by china's state media would eventually <unk> zhou's shocking <unk> last summer
after months of intense political rumors the communist party's disciplinary arm in late july announced a formal investigation into zhou for serious disciplinary violations
on saturday state run xinhua news agency reported his arrest after the communist leadership <unk> him from the party
zhou's case was sent to the country's highest prosecution authority <unk> the way for a criminal trial that would make him the most senior official ever to face corruption charges in the history of the people's republic
party investigators found the seventy one year old former leader received huge bribes abused his power to benefit family and friends and <unk> state secrets according to xinhua
he was also accused of having affairs with multiple women and trading power and money for sex
many have viewed his fall from grace as a <unk> moment in the secretive world of chinese politics now ruled by president xi jinping who has been <unk> a massive anti corruption campaign <unk> targeting tigers and flies high ranking and low level officials alike
the important thing here is that xi has proven he's powerful enough to break this <unk> of never <unk> former politburo standing committee members said longtime political analyst <unk> lam with chinese university of hong kong
unlike xi who is communist <unk> thanks to his father's status as one of chairman <unk> <unk> in arms during the revolution zhou was born to a poor family in eastern china
his father was an <unk> farmer but <unk> money to send him to school
smart and <unk> zhou didn't <unk> and went on to become one of the few local students admitted into an elite university in beijing
that school now called china university of <unk> was the <unk> for <unk> in the state oil industry
after <unk> with a degree in oil exploration zhou was assigned to an oil field in the country's northeast and rose through the official ranks from the late one thousand nine hundred and sixty s through the mid one thousand nine hundred and eighty s
described by many as a capable and <unk> young party <unk> zhou was remembered more for his political <unk> than technical knowledge
his political skill <unk> when he was transferred to the oil ministry in beijing which later became a giant state owned oil company and one of zhou's power bases
read
in china everyone is guilty of corruption
<unk> <unk> wars in the ministry zhou was said to be a decisive leader who focused on expanding domestic oil exploration as well as overseas projects a two <unk> strategy that would continue to this day
fast growth of business abroad made <unk> from beijing harder <unk> the <unk> for corruption
in two thousand and one after a stint as minister of land resources zhou was named the communist party chief of sichuan in southwest china one of the country's most populous provinces
state media there portrayed zhou as an <unk> leader with a clear vision and credited him for <unk> high tech companies including <unk> to the southwestern province as well as <unk> the agriculture and tourism sectors
zhou also developed strong local ties and <unk> officials loyal to him including <unk> he brought from beijing in key <unk> throughout the province
zhou's big break came in two thousand and two when he returned to beijing and was put in charge of the ministry of public security which runs the country's police forces
five years later he rose to the <unk> of power by taking a seat in the nine member politburo standing committee with an expanded <unk> that covered all domestic security affairs
his reign <unk> with a time of <unk> social and ethnic unrest as well as such major events as the beijing olympics in two thousand and eight the sixty th anniversary of the people's republic in two thousand and nine and the world <unk> in shanghai in two thousand and ten
as the leadership <unk> security and stability above all else zhou greatly expanded police power at the expense of already limited judicial independence <unk> his reputation as a ruthless <unk> among political dissidents and activists
it was also during this period that zhou became a patron of bo <unk> a fast rising political star who was waging his own controversial war against organized crime in the southwestern <unk> of <unk>
<unk> spectacular <unk> in two thousand and twelve complete with <unk> of murder <unk> and <unk> attracted global attention
state media cited his subsequent conviction on corruption charges as a prime example of xi's resolve to clean up the party
bo supporters however have long called him a political victim as the former high flying politician was once considered xi's main challenger for the top spot of chinese leadership
political activists and observers now note the <unk> between the bo and zhou cases
zhou challenged xi's authority and threatened his rule that's why he's now being held responsible along with his <unk> offered <unk> <unk> one of china's leading political dissidents who was thrown into prison for more than three years on <unk> charges when zhou first took over nationwide law enforcement
the bottom line is
all officials are corrupt he added
xi can't find a better excuse to rid of his political opponents than fighting corruption something that helps him win the masses hearts and minds
the people being investigated for corruption are on the losing side of <unk> struggles echoed lam the hong kong analyst
people who are close to xi are less <unk> to becoming <unk>
those close to zhou have fallen with him
state media have reported official investigations and formal arrests in some cases into dozens of zhou's family members and former aides
the biggest impact was felt in the domestic security <unk> state oil industry and sichuan province three places zhou once ruled
details have also emerged in chinese media about possible <unk> in zhou's <unk> including the suspicious circumstances surrounding the death of his first wife
most stories though have focused on the vast wealth <unk> by zhou's older son as well as his two brothers and their families
the <unk> reportedly benefited <unk> from china's booming energy and real estate sectors thanks to zhou's deep ties to the two related <unk>
zhou's older son who is forty two is said to own multiple luxury properties worth millions of dollars
before even turning thirty the younger zhou's first <unk> into business met with fast growth and quick success after winning a <unk> to <unk> it systems for eight thousand gas stations across china
his companies also reportedly <unk> huge financial gain from buying and selling oil fields and <unk> stations
state media reports also indicated that one of zhou's younger brothers a <unk> farmer used zhou's influence to launch a crisis management business and <unk> from helping people get out of jail enter police academy and sell steel <unk> to state owned oil fields

but if you think it's gross i can't even start to explain the beauty to you
then after a moment of reflection he adds
i'm not <unk>
as part of the <unk> <unk> van <unk> collective which makes the unusual move of including charles <unk> as a member van <unk> and his artistic partner <unk> <unk> create extraordinary <unk> <unk> that have been and <unk> all over the world
the pieces are inspired by the paintings of seventeen th century <unk> like <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> van <unk> and have been called <unk> seventeen th century luxury
the <unk> of <unk> cool and <unk> <unk> led one reviewer to say that it <unk> <unk> to a higher plane
there is no doubt
van <unk> and <unk> who sport wild hair and beards and wear <unk> <unk> <unk> are the hottest thing to happen to <unk> in decades
demand is growing for their work with pieces selling for between two thousand and twenty five <unk> <unk> twenty five november their latest exhibition will be coming to the <unk> rare book store in london
given these achievements many find it hard to believe that van <unk> has only been in the game for three years
i was forty seven years old and was running my own advertising agency he recalls
we were on a family holiday in new zealand and over dinner i just said to my wife i know what i want to do
i want to be a <unk>
it had never occurred to me before that day and it changed my life overnight
his wife has accepted it and his two children he says love it
his fifteen year old son helps with the <unk> and his six year old daughter likes it too though she gets a bit worried when i start <unk> the cat
part of the secret to the <unk> success is the quality that is evident from their work
in some quarters <unk> has become quite <unk> over recent years but it's rare to find <unk> animals that can <unk> be mistaken for living creatures
we use the old <unk> <unk> methods he explains
in those days labor was not so expensive so they took their time over everything
but now mass production has taken over so speed has taken over
most modern <unk> buy a ready made <unk> and stretch the skin over the top
but we take months over each animal
we do it as it should be done and the results speak for themselves
it takes months rather than hours
among the works of art van <unk> and <unk> have produced are a beautiful <unk> with raised wings
a <unk> with its <unk> spread into an artistic action pose
a <unk> with its tail raised in a <unk> circle
and a red <unk> blue <unk> wings and tail <unk> back as if in some magical flight
i love birds says van <unk>
we have a network of <unk> and <unk> who give us a call when a rare animal <unk>
as an artist it's a big advantage to start with something beautiful in itself
you can't use paint to make colors like some birds have
the intensity of the colors and the <unk> of their <unk> is <unk>
in <unk> van <unk> sudden <unk> three years ago was not such a surprise
since he was a child he says he was fascinated by dead animals and has been collecting <unk> all his life
in a way it's about <unk> something beautiful he says
as a child you don't really own anything but when you find a skull you have a feeling that this is something worth a lot
that is the feeling that has stayed with me
i know it's hard to believe but it's about capturing and holding beauty not death
<unk> gardens
when art design and a whole <unk> of plants <unk>
<unk> and grieving
how the <unk> dressed for death
<unk> investment
how some whisky lovers are now making millions

it was a big risk to <unk> but her reputation as one of nigeria's most prominent architects proves that sometimes you have jump into the unknown
the office was a little bigger than three chairs
it was myself and a young boy who sat in the corridor but i started anyway because i believe that you do what you can with what you have where you are

<unk> we have three people who have been convicted in this case <unk> you would want to have all <unk> all tried together at the same time but unfortunately that could not happen not because of the <unk> or anyone else but because of the fact that we could not <unk> mr. dewani in time so that he could be tried with the other three accused <unk> said

in august two thousand and eight <unk> zazi an afghan american and two friends from his high school in queens flew from <unk> new jersey to peshawar pakistan where they hoped to join the taliban
in peshawar the trio met with ahmad an al qaeda operative who put them in touch with two al qaeda leaders
those leaders asked the three from queens to participate in attacks against the united states
zazi refused
he wanted to fight the u.s. military in the fields and mountains of his homeland not to kill american civilians in the streets of his adopted country
so according to american prosecutors al qaeda's leaders brought in someone more <unk> someone who could speak to zazi in his own language someone who had also grown up on the streets of new york city in the one thousand nine hundred and ninety s a man who had had a <unk> rise in the ranks of al qaeda over the past decade from camp <unk> to the leader of the group's operations in the west
his name was <unk> shukrijumah
eventually shukrijumah would be added to the <unk> most wanted terrorists list and a five million dollar reward would be put on his head
and on saturday shukrijumah was killed in pakistan by the pakistani military
shukrijumah was born in saudi arabia in one thousand nine hundred and seventy five but his family moved to <unk> in the <unk> and then to brooklyn in the early <unk>
in one thousand nine hundred and ninety five <unk> family left new york for the fort <unk> area in florida where he did odd jobs like selling used cars <unk> money that he used to pay for his studies in <unk> and computer science at <unk> community college
some muslim men in florida gave shukrijumah books and videos about the holy wars in <unk> and afghanistan and he was so moved by these stories of holy war that in late one thousand nine hundred and ninety nine he traveled to afghanistan to attend an al qaeda training camp
around this time shukrijumah told his mother that he was opposed to what he considered the <unk> of the west such as alcohol and drug abuse as well as the <unk> clothes that women wore in florida
in may two thousand and one he left florida again and by june he was back in afghanistan
shortly after the nine eleven attacks shukrijumah called his mother in florida saying did you hear what happened
they are putting it on the muslims
his mother advised him not to come back to the states and she said in two thousand and ten he did not contact her again
it was shukrijumah who in late two thousand and eight made the pitch to zazi and his <unk> from queens <unk> <unk> another afghan american and <unk> <unk> a <unk> driver of <unk> descent that they could help the cause of holy war best if instead of fighting alongside the <unk> tens of thousands of fighters they went back to the states after their training by al qaeda's bomb makers and launched attacks there
at the time that shukrijumah was making his pitch to the trio from queens the cia drone war in the tribal regions of pakistan was <unk> up
it was the last six months of president george w. <unk> second term and the bush administration had significantly <unk> up the drone program
angered by the cia drone program zazi agreed to return to the states to launch an attack
he also volunteered to be a suicide bomber as did his two friends
they discussed with shukrijumah potential targets such as the new york stock exchange and times square as well as a <unk> store
zazi returned to new york in mid january two thousand and nine
he had been living on the afghan pakistan border for five months during which time he had been in almost continuous contact with members of al qaeda

<unk> <unk> plan to blow up bombs in the manhattan subway around the time of the eighth anniversary of the nine eleven attacks was detected by u.s. intelligence agencies that were monitoring the email account of a known al qaeda operative in pakistan who was in touch with zazi
zazi and his two friends were arrested before they could carry out the plot
it was shukrijumah who <unk> this plot
after all who better to <unk> al qaeda plots to attack the states than someone who had grown up in brooklyn and florida
a pakistani army spokesman said on twitter on saturday that shukrijumah was killed in south waziristan along pakistan's border with afghanistan
the fact that shukrijumah is now dead makes the united states a little bit safer from al qaeda's plotting
and the fact that shukrijumah was killed in a pakistani military operation is a sign that pakistan continues to expand its operations against militants based on its border with afghanistan in a meaningful way which has long been a demand of the united states
finally <unk> death is <unk> of how al qaeda's core organization that launched the nine eleven attacks continues to <unk> in size and capacity because almost all of its leaders are now dead or captured
the elimination of almost all of al qaeda's leaders in pakistan suggests that the once global organization may become just another pakistani based jihadi group with limited or no ability to operate outside of south asia

the element of surprise was lost in a failed u.s. military raid to rescue two hostages being held by al qaeda militants in yemen a senior defense department official said saturday
american photojournalist luke somers and south african pierre korkie a respected teacher who was to be released on sunday were <unk> shot in the compound by a terrorist as the secret mission unfolded a u.s. official said
the relief group gift of the givers which was helping secure <unk> release had recently informed his wife that the waiting is almost over
three days ago we told her pierre will be home for christmas said the group which identified the south african hostage as korkie
we certainly did not mean it in the manner it has unfolded
he was an innocent man a respected teacher <unk> wife yolande said in a video made before his death
u.s. president barack obama ordered friday's mission because there were <unk> reasons to believe mr. somers life was in imminent danger defense secretary <unk> hagel said
a video of somers pleading for his life was released earlier this week by al qaeda in the arabian peninsula
aqap gave the u.s. three days to <unk> with <unk> demands
time was running out
<unk> for <unk> release may have been missed by the white house
the obama administration <unk> that there were two individuals at the location but did not know one was south african or that negotiations were under way for his release a senior state department official told cnn
korkie and his wife were abducted in may of last year but aqap <unk> let his wife go
on friday a team of local leaders was <unk> <unk> to reunite korkie with his wife and children the relief group said in a statement
the president condemned <unk> killing of the two hostages and explained his decision to <unk> the rescue attempt
earlier this week a video released by his terrorist captors announced that luke would be killed within seventy two hours obama said in a statement
i also authorized the rescue of any other hostages held in the same location as luke
secretary of state john kerry said in a statement that the president had received a recommendation to <unk> the operation
i also offer my thoughts and prayers to the family of a non u.s. citizen hostage who was also murdered by these terrorists during the rescue operation the statement read
their despair and sorrow at this time are beyond words
south africa's department of international relations and cooperation expressed its deepest condolences to the family and friends of mr korkie for their loss
condolences are also <unk> to the family and loved ones of the deceased american hostage
they lost the element of surprise
the operation took place friday at five p.m
et a u.s. official told cnn
on thursday the defense department became aware of enough new intelligence about the location of the hostages to stage a rescue mission the official said
a senior defense department official traveling with hagel in afghanistan said that the operation was <unk> because there was intelligence that somers would be killed on saturday morning eastern time
obama and hagel were briefed the next day
two <unk> aircraft transported a team of about three dozen u.s. navy <unk> mainly from <unk> team six and a combat medical team near the captives location
there were no yemeni forces with the u.s. commandos
the official traveling with hagel said that once the <unk> landed the team had to <unk> about ten kilometers to the compound
they were discovered about one hundred meters from the location where korkie and somers were being held according to that official
the main part of the assault lasted five to ten minutes
they lost the element of surprise at the last minute as they approached the compound the official said
it was not clear where the kidnappers were when the firefight started but the official said that the u.s. is certain that someone ran back inside the compound and shot korkie and somers after the battle broke out
the official would not specify how it could be certain of that detail
u.s. forces were on the ground for about thirty minutes an official told cnn
they stayed for that length of time because the combat medical team was trying to <unk> the two wounded hostages
according to another official the hostages were <unk> onto a plane and flown to a nearby u.s. ship
one of the hostages died before reaching the ship
the other died afterward
<unk> and fighter jets <unk> overhead during the mission
the u.s. forces that carried out the mission are safe a u.s. defense official said
both the president and kerry praised their <unk>
the hostages were being kept at a location close to one where u.s. and yemeni forces had carried out a previous raid
this rescue mission was particularly difficult due in part to yemen's <unk> population retired lt. col. james <unk> global affairs analyst for cnn said saturday
<unk> noted that it would have been difficult for the military to travel a significant distance by air and still maintain the element of surprise in a rescue operation
it has to take precision he said
this is like brain surgery
it was the second such attempt by u.s. forces in two weeks
in the first attempt in november u.s. and yemeni special forces <unk> with night <unk> <unk> on the mission about a few miles from a cave where aqap was holding hostages
a <unk> <unk> and the special forces killed all seven <unk> and freed eight hostages
but the militants had separated somers and four more hostages from the group and moved them to another location two days before the raid
this week aqap released a video threatening to kill somers and showing the american photojournalist pleading for his life
a spokesman read a statement saying somers would be killed if washington did not meet the terror group's demands
the spokesman did not name the demands but said the u.s. government knew what they were
somers brother and mother posted a response video to youtube in which they pleaded with the militants to spare him
he is not responsible for any actions that the u.s. government has taken
please understand that we had no prior knowledge of the rescue attempt for luke and we mean no harm to anyone jordan somers said
<unk> somers thanked his captors for taking good care of him but also asked her son be returned to her alive
please show mercy and give us an opportunity to see our luke again
he is all that we have she said
<unk> root a former freelance journalist met luke somers when they were both in yemen
of all the people i met in yemen luke is certainly not the person that should have happened to root told cnn
he was passionate about the country its people and he was just a very <unk> <unk> guy
root is now a desk assistant for <unk> <unk> and he wrote about somers on saturday morning on <unk> website
i didn't know him particularly well but we did cross paths about a dozen times root said
he was really dedicated to yemen
affected by the storm
send your photos to cnn <unk> but please stay safe
a massive typhoon <unk> across central philippines on sunday sending thousands of people into shelters and pouring heavy rain that heightened the risk of flooding and landslides
typhoon hagupit its name means <unk> in filipino moved west northwest and targeted the city of legazpi just north of where the storm made landfall on saturday
cnn's <unk> <unk> reporting from legazpi on sunday said shelters were full as high winds and driving rain battered the city
one of the city's major fears is a storm surge that could reach two four meters
with memories of last year's devastating super typhoon fresh in their minds more than six hundred thousand people had evacuated by saturday morning according to the national disaster risk reduction and management council
about forty million people are in the path of the <unk> winds
gen. <unk> <unk> chief of staff of armed forces said at a sunday press conference that soldiers were working to clear roads and airports so that emergency services could be delivered
eleven nations had offered assistance including the australia the united states china japan and the united kingdom
cnn meteorologist <unk> van dam said that the storm is actually breaking up over the land mass of the philippines but will continue to <unk> heavy rain
he said three hundred and ninety five <unk> of rain were reported in <unk> in twenty four hours
hagupit is moving slowly on its west northwest track at fifteen <unk>
at that rate it will take about three days for the storm to travel past the capital manila <unk> extreme amounts of rainfall more than a foot in some places as it goes
expected to lose some punch by manila
hagupit should be significantly weaker by the time it <unk> manila but winds will still be higher than one hundred <unk>
the biggest threat in the capital will come from the heavy rainfall
that will lead to flash flooding and <unk> even in places far away from the <unk> center
despite the threats of danger a cnn crew in legazpi saw many residents who were <unk> evacuation orders and <unk> to stay in their makeshift <unk> homes
i think we can handle the situation
if or when it gets worse we'll go to the evacuation center one man said
we've been here twenty five years and seen many <unk> said a woman at the coast
this one already feels stronger than typhoon haiyan but we won't leave yet
the typhoon came <unk> on eastern <unk> island just before ten p.m. with winds of two hundred and five <unk> the equivalent of a category three <unk>
one city farther south <unk> a <unk> of relief on sunday
in tacloban the streets were empty because residents had already evacuated
last year super typhoon haiyan devastated tacloban killing more than six thousand people and making around two hundred thousand people homeless
mayor <unk> <unk> told cnn the city is without power but he's seen only minor damage with broken windows and trees down
many roads were <unk> but not <unk>
about forty eight thousand people have moved to evacuation centers he said
there have been no casualties
cnn's asia pacific editor andrew <unk> reporting from tacloban said there was no storm surge
the main <unk> here is one of relief he said
there was a lot of preparation <unk> <unk> spokeswoman for the united nations humanitarian agency <unk> told cnn
i think that the lessons learned were very hard ones in tacloban
because there were so many lives lost and i think they've really taken <unk> this time and really made an all out effort everywhere to bring people to safety
philippines gets more than its share of disasters
cnn's <unk> park and cnn meteorologist <unk> <unk> contributed to this report
last december five just after seven p.m. south african time i got a text message from one member of nelson mandela's family
it's imminent
and so that's how i knew a great man was taking his final <unk>
it's done said the next message from those who were with him at the end
it was nine p.m. and nelson mandela was gone
by that stage we were all in the cnn bureau and ready to go live to tell the world mandela was gone
however i had made a promise to my sources that i would not go to air with any information they gave me about his condition until there were an official announcement by president <unk> <unk>
the televised address to the nation came just before midnight
it was a long wait but i was so grateful to his family for <unk> me with the information those three hours of preparation allowed me the time and space to clear my head
i am a south african a white south african whose country was changed for the better by his <unk> leadership
i had my own personal thanks to give for mandela's life
then i had the responsibility of delivering this news to cnn's global audience
that task continued for the next eleven days until he was buried in the rural <unk> around his <unk> home in <unk> eastern cape
the immediate days after mandela's passing created a wonderful <unk> mood in the country strange as it might have seemed to others
for south africans it was the most natural reaction
sadness and mourning had been done already in the months before when he was critically <unk> now south africans gave thanks <unk> in <unk> and came together in ways that reflected the debt they <unk> to this one man
white black old young gathered outside his house in johannesburg laying flowers and saying a personal prayer of thanks
it was <unk> to watch
the <unk> pavement <unk> of <unk> <unk> became like an <unk> of reflection for a time of hope and reconciliation that seemed like an age away
it was called mandela magic and now that he was gone it felt like the magic that had sustained a battered <unk> nation would go with him
it was always an <unk> false even <unk> that mandela saved south africa
south africans did it together he just led them on the right path
still older south africans brought their children some just babies wrapped in blankets to his home in the days after he died
often they dressed the kids up in their best clothes like they were going to church and <unk> walked to the <unk> of flowers on the sidewalk or <unk> by the <unk> walls
it was as if a whole generation of south africans wanted their kids to feel and <unk> in that last little bit of mandela magic
there was an important sense of occasion a <unk> need to be there
at times i watched families appear quietly outside mandela's home and <unk> <unk> up the atmosphere
other times i felt like i was watching <unk> <unk> gifts to a <unk> pushing forward <unk> and young kids to the front of crowds just so their children could be closer to the place where he died
in years to come a new generation of children will be able to say i was there
i said goodbye
mandela's funeral was a measure of the man
i watched from inside the funeral tent and thought how <unk> it was that his goodbye was both about <unk> and <unk> speaking
i stood by his <unk> as it made the final journey and <unk> said goodbye and thank you as that great man was laid to rest on a simple grass <unk> as he had wished

it is the first time the british museum has <unk> one of the elgin marbles to a foreign museum
the british government and other european union and nato nations have imposed sanctions on moscow over russia's <unk> of crimea and allegations of continued interference in eastern ukraine
britain's sanctions are not cultural instead targeting russia's financial defense and energy sectors as well as imposing <unk> bans and travel restrictions on specific individuals
however <unk> statement did touch upon the issue
the <unk> have always believed that such loans must continue between museums in spite of political <unk> between governments <unk> said
it is a position <unk> shared by our counterparts in russia
western countries and the ukrainian government in kiev accuse moscow of sending troops and military equipment into eastern ukraine to help pro russian separatists fighting against government forces
russian officials have <unk> denied their military is involved
at the g twenty summit in australia last month british prime minister david cameron warned russia to change course over ukraine
otherwise cameron said the relationship that britain has with russia that the european union has with russia the relationship that i hope australia has with russia will be very different
greece has for decades been demanding the return of the sculptures which were <unk> by <unk> elgin between one thousand eight hundred and one and one thousand eight hundred and five bought from him by the british parliament in one thousand eight hundred and sixteen and later presented to the british museum
greek prime minister <unk> <unk> described the decision to loan the sculpture as a provocation to the greek people
the parthenon and its sculptures have been <unk>
the value of the sculptures is <unk> he said
we <unk> identify with our history and culture which can not be <unk> <unk> or <unk>
the elgin marbles are a series of sculptures in a frieze that once <unk> the upper sections of the parthenon in the greek capital of athens
the sculpture being <unk> to russia of the river god <unk> is one of the <unk> of those to survive from the parthenon the british museum said
describing itself as the most generous lending museum in the world the museum said the loan was part of ongoing <unk> with the hermitage which had requested it to mark the two hundred and fifty th anniversary of its foundation
the british museum is a museum of the world for the world and nothing demonstrates this more than the loan of a parthenon sculpture to the state hermitage museum in st. petersburg to celebrate its two hundred and fifty th anniversary <unk> said
<unk> <unk> director of the state hermitage museum said
i am <unk> that this important beautiful and significant sculpture has been lent in celebration of our two museums shared values and will be seen alongside the permanent <unk> sculptures of the hermitage
the british museum says the statues are part of the world's shared heritage and <unk> political boundaries
greece's prime minister said the decision to send the <unk> statue to russia <unk> what he said was the british <unk> rationale for <unk> the marbles
the last until now british <unk> that the parthenon marbles could not be moved is no longer <unk> as their other argument for the lack of an appropriate space to house them collapsed with the opening of the museum of <unk> <unk> said
the parthenon was a temple in ancient athens <unk> <unk> built in the five th century <unk>
the <unk> museum says the area is believed to have been largely intact until the seventeen th century but after damage in warfare foreign visitors began taking parts of the structure as <unk>
it was in the nineteen th century that <unk> elgin removed intact architectural sculptures from the frieze the <unk> and the <unk> of the building the museum says
the latest <unk> museum building was completed in two thousand and seven and is the place where eventually the parthenon sculptures will be reunited the museum says
it says the parthenon frieze was originally one hundred and sixty meters long
from the entire frieze that <unk> today fifty meters are in the <unk> museum eighty meters in the british museum one block in the <unk> the museum said adding that other fragments are scattered among museums in <unk> the vatican germany <unk> and denmark
earlier this year unesco said it had received a request from greece to <unk> in the dispute between greece and britain over the elgin marbles
in october the u.n. agency said it had not yet received a response to an official letter sent to the british government and the british museum

hagupit the name used by world <unk> organization means <unk> in filipino
fears over effects of the storm
with the storm fast approaching authorities are not only worried about the typhoon itself but the effects of the fierce winds possible flooding and storm surge
<unk> warned of intense rainfall warning of rainfall between seven point five and twenty <unk> per hour and rough seas
it also warned of storm surge that could reach up to five meters high
last year <unk> massive storm surge caught many people off guard as it <unk> in off the gulf of <unk> <unk> buildings and <unk> large ships onto dry land
tacloban mayor <unk> <unk> said they're better prepared this year having learned the lessons of haiyan a year ago

south africans paid tribute to nelson mandela on the first anniversary of his death with his widow <unk> citizens to carry on his legacy of love and forgiveness
officials scheduled a series of events friday to mark the anniversary of his death including a <unk> laying ceremony a <unk> match and <unk> of <unk> followed by moments of silence
his wife <unk> <unk> was among <unk> at one of the first events of the day
a <unk> laying ceremony at his statue in <unk>
during the ceremony she spoke of her husband's legacy and the need to carry it forward
<unk> legacy covers everyone in the country in africa and in the world she said
i was not able to think i was <unk>
she called on everyone to tap into his legacy of forgiveness and ensure everything he stood for lives on long after he is gone
<unk> also mentioned her sorrow at her husband's death and the feeling of <unk> that washed over her
when he left he said i leave you in peace and i want you to live in peace she said
on the day of his passing i was not able to think i was <unk>
however she said she got <unk> from knowing her husband is at peace and is with friends who died before him
she mentioned some of his closest friends including <unk> <unk> with whom mandela operated the nation's first black law firm
looking back i imagine him tall and proud walking and all of them rising to welcome him <unk> said
the <unk> <unk> emerged from prison in one thousand nine hundred and ninety after twenty seven years in detention to lead south africa out of decades of apartheid
mandela's defiance of white minority rule and <unk> for fighting against <unk> focused the world's attention on apartheid the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> by the south african government
in the years leading up to his death he battled various <unk> forcing him to retreat to a quiet life and <unk> from the <unk>
despite rare public <unk> he held a special place in the nation
in his lifetime he went from a militant freedom fighter to a prisoner to a president to an elder <unk>
mandela became the nation's first black president in one thousand nine hundred and ninety four
he retired from the presidency five years later and for many south africans he was simply <unk> his traditional clan name
others <unk> called him <unk> the <unk> word for father
other events marking his memorial include a <unk> match between the <unk> and the <unk> and an <unk> prayer
his foundation will also have a three minute seven second <unk> of <unk> and traditional horns followed by three minutes of silence
the six minutes and seven seconds are a symbol of the sixty seven years he spent in public service
blood sweat and tears on the football pitch used to mean a very different thing in sierra leone
in a country where ebola is <unk> faster than anywhere else on the planet with around seven thousand reported cases so far each <unk> of bodily <unk> <unk> suspicion
here even a post match <unk> is an <unk> encounter
in this <unk> new climate football has been banned
and to sports <unk> sierra <unk> the embargo is <unk> to <unk> god
football is like a second religion in sierra leone explained the country's football association president <unk> johansen
bearing in mind this is a poor country you would have situations where people would rather go without food just so they could buy tickets to a big football match
on <unk> the long stretch of sand at <unk> beach outside the capital of <unk> would usually be filled with thousands of people playing the national sport
that was before the outbreak which has had over one thousand four hundred new cases in the last three weeks alone making sierra leone set to <unk> liberia as the worst affected country on the globe according to the world health <unk>
now the national premier league has been suspended
casual kick <unk> in the community have dried up
even watching the game in <unk> and <unk> has come to a <unk>
this virus is about sweat blood and interaction said fifty year old johansen when i meet her in an inner city london caf a world away from the devastation back home
and that's football
there's a lot of interaction there's a lot of sweat and blood
beyond the deadly virus itself are the psychological effects on a naturally <unk> <unk> people who love to hug and hold hands said johansen
it's a very <unk> and difficult place to be in mentally
you have to <unk> yourself
so you find that when people reach out to you it's kind of like <unk> she says <unk> up her <unk> face and holding up her hands
i think one of the vital things we've failed to <unk> to as a people is not to touch a sick person she says of a disease in which twenty percents of <unk> happen during <unk>
and that is such basic humanity isn't it
when someone you love is sick you want to hold that person you want to carry them says the mother of one
but you can't
just over a decade after the civil war which left more than fifty thousand people dead the country is now facing a new invisible enemy
it's not like the war that we've been through <unk> you saw the rebels coming said johansen who as a little girl never owned a <unk> instead playing football with her brothers and their friends
but with ebola you wake up one morning and it's hit a town it's hit another town
for a long time we didn't know the signs we didn't know the symptoms to look out for
indeed what initially appears to be a common cold can quickly escalate into <unk> <unk> and bleeding both internally and <unk>
transmission through bodily <unk> makes football a <unk> setting for infection and last month morocco <unk> on hosting the two thousand and fifteen african nations cup due to fears over the spread of the disease
let's just say i wasn't surprised said johansen who is also owner of a premier league club called <unk> johansen
i think if i was in <unk> position i would be focusing on saving lives and wanting to contain the ebola virus she says with a resigned <unk>
coming from sierra leone johansen knows full well what it's like having to beg to play in other countries
her country's players have reportedly suffered <unk> <unk> at away games with opponents refusing to their shake hands and crowds <unk> ebola at matches
personally johansen also suffered the most <unk> attacks i have ever endured though rather than ebola she says they related to her gender
as one of only two women to head a national football association in the world johansen says she came under fire in a country where women are still perceived to know their place
in sierra leone football is their all
and you don't see women playing it you don't see women telling them how to do it and you certainly don't see women organizing it says the daughter of one of the founding members of the country's east end lions football club who as a child grew up with <unk> constantly walking in and out of her family home
yes horrible things were said about me that i wouldn't want to repeat
very very <unk> things and cartoons
bearing in mind that i am a mother and i am <unk> wife and i am <unk> daughter she says about <unk> during her campaign for the top job in two thousand and twelve
her <unk> method has been to <unk> off from local media and social networks
i don't see it i don't read it she says
i kind of <unk> from that and just stay focused
she believes part of the <unk> has come from her hardline stance on corruption
the fa was in total <unk> before i came in she says
we had a bad reputation internally and <unk>
we had no structures
integrity was at an all time low
there was no discipline
and in a country where football and gambling go hand in hand <unk> zero tolerance was a hard <unk> to <unk>
if people choose to gamble as a <unk> <unk> well that's up to them she says hands <unk> around a <unk> of <unk> tea
but you can not have people in high administrative offices participating in gambling or <unk>
it's a no no
when it comes to corruption allegations at the highest levels of football's international governing body fifa johansen is less willing to talk tough
all these things that are swimming around these <unk> is something that i really wouldn't like to get involved in she says
it's really unfortunate and i'm really hoping that fifa can rise above it much sooner than later she says of the organization which this year gave sierra <unk> football association seven hundred and fifty thousand dollar plus another fifty thousand dollar towards social projects used for <unk> ebola
does that mean johansen will be <unk> for fifa president <unk> blatter in next year's election
<unk> blatter has been very supportive of african nations and trying to build up our football development she says choosing her words carefully
and in that respect i think not just myself but i most african countries will recognize that
for now her main focus is on the virus which has so far claimed over one thousand four hundred lives across the country and <unk> its beloved football fields
we're just waiting for that day when they tell us <unk>
the vaccine is out go and take your <unk> she says
every morning we wake up waiting to hear that message
investigation
why women weren't good enough for fifa report
i would never
there's an old saying that our parents give us everything from our bodies to our hair and we have to show <unk> to our family
china said on thursday it would end the <unk> of organs from executed prisoners on january one and while the move has been welcomed by human rights groups it's hard to see how china can <unk> itself from the controversial practice if the views of people like zhou are anything to go by
traditional beliefs regard the body as sacred and it should remain intact after death
what's more even if people are prepared to donate there are fears that their body parts may be traded for profit and end up on the black market
thus making a quick <unk> from organs <unk> by death row inmates to a system based on <unk> will be tough without a major shift in attitudes something the head of china's <unk> system <unk>
people have concerns about whether the organs will be allocated in a fair open and just way huang <unk> director of the china <unk> <unk> and <unk> committee said according to state media
china has one of the world's lowest rates of <unk> <unk> with ten thousand procedures each year
the country launched a <unk> <unk> <unk> in two thousand and ten but between that year and two thousand and thirteen only one thousand four hundred and forty eight people donated organs a drop in the ocean compared with around three hundred thousand people in need of <unk> <unk> each year
and just zero point six people out of every million citizens have signed up to donate their organs when they die
to <unk> the <unk> china has relied <unk> on organs from death row prisoners
<unk> their organs can only be used under certain conditions such as if no one <unk> the body the <unk> gives <unk> or their family agrees to the medical use of the body
however observers both in and outside china have questioned whether prisoners have the free will to give their <unk> and say it's become an <unk> policy that prisoners organs can be used to ease the <unk>
even with the new rules it's likely that death row inmates will still supply organs for <unk>
huang said that prisoners will still be <unk> to donate but their organs will be registered in a <unk> <unk> system instead of being traded privately according to official english language newspaper china daily
<unk> <unk> deputy director asia division human rights watch in new york says he's extremely skeptical about whether china can really end its <unk> on prisoners organs in the foreseeable future
the <unk> of china's prison and death penalty system the massive <unk> in <unk> <unk> and corruption make it near impossible he says
many chinese citizens would be <unk> about voluntarily signing away their organs even for <unk>
such fears are not <unk> given the <unk> underground trade in organs and even <unk>
last month local officials in southern china were found to have bought and sold dead bodies to <unk> <unk> <unk> in a body <unk> scandal across two provinces
and earlier this year authorities jailed a twelve member gang that recruited donors online and <unk> their <unk> by <unk> them as <unk> <unk>
there are tentative signs that attitudes are beginning to change
since the beginning of the year one thousand five hundred people have donated organs more than the total between two thousand and ten and two thousand and thirteen
the government has set up a website to make it easier to become a <unk> but it's still something that few young people are willing to discuss with their families
<unk> have suggested that financial <unk> including payment of funeral and medical bills might help
liu <unk> a twenty four year old audio engineer from beijing says it's something he might consider
i want to help those in need and i feel like it would be a <unk> of my life he says
at least ten patients have been left permanently blind following <unk> <unk> <unk> at an illegal medical camp in <unk> state india health officials say
the operations were carried out at a free <unk> eye camp at <unk> <unk> <unk> hospital <unk> organized by a non government organization <unk> deputy commissioner <unk> <unk> told cnn
sixty two people mostly of them aged over sixty had <unk> <unk> surgery at the camp held on november four five <unk> <unk> <unk> minister for local bodies medical education and research told cnn
seventeen later complained of severe pain in their eyes he said and had <unk> been treated at an eye clinic at <unk> government medical college
dr <unk> singh an <unk> specialist at government medical college who is now working to help the affected patients said that of the seventeen who approached the deputy commissioner with complaints on december three ten were now permanently blind
three patients were receiving treatment one of whom <unk> their sight while four had left the hospital for personal reasons despite their eyes being in very poor condition
singh said the infections could have been caused <unk> instruments or <unk> and it would be very hard to restore sight to those affected
officials have launched an inquiry into the camp and were trying to trace everyone who was operated on so they could be <unk> by singh said <unk>
medical camps often run by non government organizations are <unk> in india helping to bring <unk> to many poor people in rural areas who would otherwise be deprived of their services
they are usually approved by the department of health and welfare
but <unk> said that no such <unk> had been granted to the eye camp and its operations were illegal
he said a police report had been filed against the ngo and the doctors involved on the grounds of <unk> and other medical camps in the city had been told to halt operations while their <unk> were reviewed
india's health sector has come in for harsh scrutiny in the wake of a <unk> of recent incidents in surgery camps
earlier this week officials in <unk> state announced an investigation after bicycle <unk> were used to <unk> the <unk> of fifty six women <unk> sterilization surgery at a government run community health center
and last month a surgeon was arrested on charges of <unk> and attempted culpable homicide in the deaths of a dozen women who had <unk> sterilization operations at a mobile clinic in <unk>

america has driven a golden <unk> as it <unk> a bridge into the future a nasa <unk> said as the capsule <unk> on the <unk> surface during the agency's tv broadcast of the event

nasa wants to prove flight and re entry <unk> before it carries astronauts
the orion crew module which looks like a <unk> to the apollo era but <unk> could take astronauts back to the moon but also far beyond
one of orion's tasks might be to send astronauts to an asteroid perhaps one that nasa would first <unk> <unk> to orbit around the moon
nasa says it hopes that orion pushed by a more powerful rocket system under development will send astronauts to an asteroid in the two thousand and twenty s
nasa hopes orion later will send astronauts to mars <unk> and eventually to the red planet itself
while nasa focuses on deeper space private space companies such as <unk> are expected to take over the space <unk> old job of <unk> astronauts and supplies to the international space station in low earth orbit
when it becomes fully operational orion's crew module will be able to carry four people on a twenty one day mission into deep space or six astronauts for shorter missions
by comparison the apollo crew <unk> held three astronauts and were in space for six to twelve days
orion's crew module is sixteen point five feet in diameter and apollo was twelve point eight feet in diameter nasa said
friday's launch came a day after nasa <unk> its first attempt because of a failure of some <unk> in the <unk> to close
those <unk> which allow fuel to flow into the <unk> before launch are supposed to close just before <unk>
engineers and scientists will examine all sorts of data including those collected by on board recorders to determine how well the capsule performed friday
this includes how well the heat <unk> which keeps the capsule from burning up on re entry held up

there are civilians here but they <unk> out a life in the rubble seeking food and fuel as winter <unk> and likely number in the low thousands
there are civilians here who refuse to flee or can not

conditions in indian sterilization <unk> are under renewed scrutiny after a doctor was removed from his job for using a bicycle pump to <unk> women's <unk> during the procedure
health officials in <unk> state have launched an investigation after reports that bicycle <unk> were used on fifty six women <unk> sterilization surgery at a government run community health center in <unk> <unk> district friday
the <unk> was identified as dr. <unk> <unk> <unk> a retired surgeon who carried out work when required for the clinic said <unk> health secretary <unk> <unk>
she said he would no longer be called on to work for the clinic and could face charges as a result of the inquiry
when contacted by cnn <unk> refused to comment
<unk> said the medical equipment that should have been used in the procedure a carbon <unk> <unk> had been provided to the clinic and investigators would try to determine why it was not used
but <unk> <unk> a health official in the district where the procedures took place said <unk> revealed the <unk> was missing which is why the bicycle pump had been used instead
a health official who did not wish to be named told cnn that the use of bicycle <unk> in sterilization surgery was widespread
in the wake of the incident state health officials issued a <unk> that all <unk> must be carried out according to correct <unk>
in sterilization surgery the patient's <unk> needs to be <unk> to allow room to move <unk> instruments
dr. <unk> <unk> the chief medical officer at the <unk> medical institute in new delhi told cnn that using a carbon <unk> <unk> allows a doctor to measure and <unk> the amount of pressure placed on the <unk>
using a bicycle pump a method <unk> said he was <unk> to hear about is highly dangerous
if you use a bicycle pump you don't know how much air you're <unk> in and you might burst the <unk> he said
dr. <unk> <unk> the chief medical officer for <unk> district said none of the fifty six women who <unk> surgery on friday reported any problems
for decades in a bid to <unk> population growth the indian government has run a nationwide sterilization program
particularly in <unk> rural areas where access to other forms of <unk> is limited sterilization is a popular option
women are paid to have the operations and doctors are given <unk> to perform them
but health advocates claim that conditions at the mobile <unk> where the procedures are often performed known as sterilization camps are sometimes <unk> and dangerous
last month a surgeon was arrested on charges of <unk> and attempted culpable homicide in the deaths of a dozen women who had <unk> sterilization operations at a mobile clinic in <unk> one of india's most impoverished states which borders <unk>
dr. <unk> <unk> <unk> assisted by a team of fellow medical professionals operated on eighty three women in a span of six hours including twelve who <unk> died

his encounter with officer daniel <unk> was captured on video
another video shows the dying man lying on the street for more than six minutes as officers calmly wait for an ambulance showing no sign of urgency
fundamental questions are being asked and <unk> so about how we respect <unk> rights how we reduce the use of force in the relationship between police and community in each encounter between police and community how we get it right new york mayor bill de blasio said
the mayor said
this tragedy is raising a lot of tough questions
there's tremendous resolve here in this city to answer those questions to get it right
<unk> may not stand trial in garner's death but he's not off the <unk>
attorney general eric holder said that the u.s. justice department will conduct an <unk> and fair civil rights probe into the incident
the new york police department is taking a fresh look at the case as well <unk> its internal investigation of garner's death by <unk> more officers
even if it's not illegal the city's police department patrol guide states its officers will not use <unk> which it <unk> as any action <unk> the throat or <unk>

once this investigation is finished it's possible that a <unk> settlement will be reached or that there will be a department trial
if there's a finding of <unk> a decision will be made as to an appropriate penalty or discipline for that said police commissioner william <unk> who would decide on the punishment
so who was eric garner
before his death at the age of forty three he was a father of six as well as a grandfather
he was also someone with a history of run <unk> with the law including thirty arrests
when police confronted him in july they suspected that he was illegally selling <unk> <unk> something for which he had previously been arrested
but his family and its supporters can't understand how anyone could think officers actions that day were justified
garner's mother <unk> <unk> wondered how the grand jury which was of mixed race and heard from dozens of police and civilian witnesses between september twenty nine and december three could decide there wasn't probable cause for an <unk> after seeing the widely distributed video
and his widow <unk> garner was angry that somebody that gets paid to do right did wrong and was not held accountable for it
but my husband's death will not be in <unk>
as long as i have a breath in my body i will fight the fight <unk> the end she added

one suit from two thousand and thirteen was dismissed in january two thousand and fourteen while the second from february two thousand and fourteen remains open
speaking specifically about the garner case <unk> said he understood people's anger over the scenes on the video but that he also <unk> the legal process and the grand <unk> judgment in spite of the images
as much as we think video is the final <unk> it is not he said
the grand jury saw much more evidence and argument than the public or he have seen he said
a judge ruled thursday against <unk> some of the testimony and evidence presented to <unk> one day after the <unk> island district attorney filed a motion asking for such a release given the public interest in the case
certain facts about the jury however were released
it sat for nine weeks and heard from a fifty witnesses including civilians officers and medical personnel
sixty <unk> were admitted into evidence including four videos
<unk> police union defended his tackle with <unk> <unk> association president patrick lynch saying it is clear that the <unk> intention was to do nothing more than take mr. garner into custody as <unk> and that he used the <unk> technique that he learned in the academy when mr. garner refused

just a few weeks ago the <unk> single <unk> <unk> <unk> two thousand and thirteen made by <unk> giant <unk> took home top honors in jim <unk> whisky <unk>
the whisky <unk> referred to it as near <unk> genius

while japanese whisky has been taking home awards for over a decade this was a first
and standing in the <unk> <unk> high with <unk> <unk> some american some spanish and some japanese you get the sense that its rise around the globe has only just begun
<unk> chief <unk> <unk> fukuyo is responsible for every bottle of whisky don't call it <unk> he says that leaves the ninety year old distillery
while the scotland trained fukuyo is modest about taking home the top title he is clearly proud of what japanese whisky has achieved
the secret he says is not <unk> but balance
perhaps it's the <unk> of the water which fukuyo says makes a <unk> spirit
or maybe it's because the whisky is exposed to japan's dry cold <unk> and hot <unk> <unk> as it <unk> inside those <unk>
or maybe it's about the <unk>
the <unk> industry has more than one hundred <unk> there so <unk> can choose from each distillery fukuyo points out
but we have only two <unk> <unk> one grain distillery
that's why we have to make different types of whisky even in one distillery
it's our challenge
<unk> <unk> won't show us the secret behind his craft but when we ask him how he <unk> the quality he gives us a glimpse into the science
<unk> of the most popular <unk> can change up to two dozen times a year fukuyo says because no two <unk> are exactly the same
change one <unk> in the <unk> and that precious balance is no more
it's a challenge that seems even more <unk> when we learn some products use fifteen or twenty different types of whisky
even single <unk> contains whisky from about ten <unk> he says although all from a single distillery to <unk> for the single <unk> <unk>
from <unk> we're on to <unk>
if you like your whisky <unk> well here's the first big surprise with japanese whisky
add water
even if it's just a <unk>
fukuyo says adding water is a must in order to release the <unk> and <unk> the full <unk>
that's because most japanese enjoy drinking whisky with a <unk> sometimes on the rocks sometimes in a <unk> glass with <unk>
so once in the glass the whisky has to hold its character and <unk> even while the proof begins to drop
fukuyo <unk> he drinks it straight but definitely not without a drop or two of water to open it up
as for that best in the world whisky
you can't get it in japan fukuyo says
only three thousand <unk> were released and they were all <unk>
while japanese whisky is making headlines whisky culture in the country is <unk> low key
many whisky bars are small with only a dozen or so seats and a <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> the <unk> designer at the park hotel tokyo gives us a first hand look at japanese whisky bar <unk> skills
<unk> <unk> is mr. ice man and we soon learn why when he sets to work <unk> a rough <unk> sized block of ice into a smooth <unk>
fragments fly in every direction as <unk> <unk> away before he <unk> his <unk> into a <unk> glass <unk> single <unk> whisky over the top and then carefully <unk> the <unk> twice with a <unk> to release the <unk>
japanese whisky has a good balance <unk> says
compared with <unk> whisky it does not lose the taste and <unk> when you mix it with other drinks
it is easy to use as a <unk> base
so we ask for an old <unk>
and he just looks at us
a different <unk> might raise an <unk> but <unk> is far too polite
which japanese whisky would be best for that we ask
the answer it turns out is none
according to <unk> <unk> the spirits with anything but ice water or <unk> would ruin its <unk> and balance
but he says of course he'll make one if the customer really wants it
we've learned our lesson
another twelve year <unk> on the rock please
it's time to relax and enjoy

the rival <unk> of japanese <unk>
it was a routine call for the norwegian fighter pilot participating in <unk> quick reaction alert mission high in the sky off <unk> coast
he was tasked with investigating and identifying an aircraft that had entered the <unk> patrol area in international airspace northwest of norway
<unk> clouds dotted the <unk> blue atmosphere and it looked like it would be a non <unk> mission until something gray <unk> in front of the norwegian pilot's f sixteen a russian <unk> fighter according to the norwegian <unk> ministry
what the hell
is a loose relatively polite translation of what he's heard saying on video released by norwegian military
he was surprised and he expressed it norwegian navy <unk>
<unk> <unk> told cnn wednesday in a telephone interview
the video appears to be recorded from the norwegian <unk> own camera and shows the russian fighter in the lower right <unk> of the shot
the norwegian aircraft then banks sharply to the left to <unk> away from the <unk>
the encounter took place <unk> in the past two years <unk> said
the video was released to show just an example of the kind of situations that our pilots flying the nato <unk> missions can encounter said <unk>
<unk> <unk> information officer for the national joint headquarters norway in a statement wednesday
we do not know if this incident was caused by the russian pilot <unk> the distance to the norwegian fighter or if it was an <unk> <unk>
there have been a few incidents like this over the years but i would like to press that the majority of the made by norwegian fighters take place without incident <unk> statement added
the russian jet didn't appear to be acting in an aggressive manner <unk> said but it's not clear what it was doing
he came too close but he was not aggressive he said
<unk> explained that a pilot he spoke to not the pilot in the video said it was an unusual situation and that pilot couldn't <unk> any similar behavior in the recent past
when we observe unknown planes we identify them so it was a normal mission for us to go and identify this plane <unk> said
there was no attempt to make radio contact with the russian jet he said
<unk> said it's important to note that norway has not experienced the same increase in russian air activity in its area of responsibility as has been seen by partners in the <unk> region
last year we had forty one <unk> and identified fifty eight russian aircraft
as of now the numbers are forty three sixty nine for two thousand and fourteen the ministry statement said
the nato quick reaction alert mission tasks partners with <unk> the skies to identify suspicious aircraft
this <unk> the alliance to <unk> track and identify to the greatest extent possible all aerial objects approaching or operating within nato airspace so that violations and <unk> can be recognized and the appropriate action taken said a statement on <unk> website

gangnam style has been viewed so many times we have to <unk>
for anyone who doesn't have an advanced degree in <unk> that basically means <unk> view counter was based on a thirty two bit <unk> a unit of data in computer <unk> languages and the number two billion one hundred and forty seven million four hundred and eighty three thousand six hundred and forty seven is its maximum positive value
when <unk> built youtube nine years ago they probably never <unk> that a video on the young platform back when several million views was considered a <unk> hit might be watched more than two point one billion times
as of late wednesday morning gangnam style had <unk> the barrier showing more than two billion one hundred and fifty two million five hundred and twelve thousand views
so how is this possible
<unk> software engineers saw the problem coming and recently updated to a sixty four bit view counter across the site google spokesman <unk> <unk> said
the view counter can now go up to nine <unk> views which should hold <unk> for a while
nothing actually broke <unk> said
there was never anything that actually went wrong

american couple matthew and grace huang fought the qatari legal system for nearly two years over allegations that they <unk> their adopted daughter to death
now cleared they have begun their journey home to the united states
the huangs left qatar on a plane wednesday afternoon three days after an <unk> court cleared them in the january two thousand and thirteen death of their eight year old daughter family spokesman eric volz said on twitter
thank you to all the silent heroes on this one
wheels are up tweeted volz who works with the international crisis resource group david house agency which helped with the huangs court case in qatar
volz tweeting from the plane also posted a picture of the couple aboard the aircraft
an appeals judge in qatar on sunday cleared the huangs of starving their adopted daughter to death in two thousand and thirteen in a case that drew global attention to that country's justice system
despite the ruling the huangs were blocked from leaving qatar at <unk> international airport by immigration officials who confiscated their passports according to the doha news agency which cited volz
diplomatic sources said monday the departure was delayed due only to legal procedures that take place once people have been cleared of a crime
on tuesday u.s
ambassador to qatar <unk> smith said a travel ban against the couple was lifted following a motion that was filed monday and after talks between smith and top qatari officials
the huangs who were living in qatar while matthew huang worked for an international company that was <unk> sites for the two thousand and twenty two world cup were arrested in january two thousand and thirteen when their eight year old daughter gloria died
they were charged with starving her to death convicted in march and sentenced to three years in prison
the qatari prosecutor sought to paint the huangs as <unk> alleging they bought their adopted daughter <unk> from her poverty <unk> parents in africa and had threatened to seek human trafficking charges
the couple spent nearly a year in prison before being freed in november two thousand and thirteen to <unk> proceedings surrounding an appeal that they filed
<unk> judge <unk> al <unk> overturned the conviction on sunday citing <unk> in forensic reports and saying the trial judge failed to properly consider testimony from witnesses who said gloria wasn't deprived
a report by pathologists hired by the defense obtained by cnn stated they found no evidence that tissue samples were taken from <unk> body after her death despite that qatari investigators submitted an autopsy report
advocates for the huangs suggested the lab report was fabricated and said their request with the qatari judiciary for a formal investigation went unanswered
after the couple's arrest their two sons also adopted from africa were temporarily placed in a qatari <unk>
they have since been sent back to the united states to live with grace <unk> mother
new elections will probably be held on march seventeen the speaker of israel's parliament said wednesday a day after the prime minister <unk> two senior members of his coalition cabinet for criticizing government policy
prime minister benjamin netanyahu also called for parliament to be <unk> a step that the knesset is now considering
lawmakers voted unanimously to <unk> parliament in a preliminary vote wednesday according to the official knesset website
a knesset committee will now prepare a bill for further votes by lawmakers early next week
speaker <unk> <unk> said the party heads had agreed on march seventeen as the proposed election date
the <unk> was triggered when netanyahu ordered letters of <unk> for finance minister <unk> lapid and justice minister <unk> livni two members of his cabinet from rival parties according to a statement from his office tuesday
during the last few weeks and in particular the last few days the ministers have intensely attacked the government that i am leading netanyahu said
i will not tolerate ministers attacking the government's policy and its head from inside the government
the call for new elections means israel is effectively in a state of political <unk> until march
israel held its last election just twenty two months ago
a poll for israel's channel two suggested that fifty five percents of those surveyed were against another election being held so soon
netanyahu will hope that the vote <unk> him to form a government he can work with including right wing and religious parties but there is no guarantee that he will be able to form the coalition he wants
netanyahu has been prime minister since two thousand and nine
but he's had to rely on members of other parties many of them to the left of likud on the political <unk> such as the centrist parties of livni and lapid to govern
netanyahu is also <unk> that he can win a fourth term in office
opinion polls give a mixed picture indicating that many people blame him for the current crisis but that at the same time if elections were held today his right wing likud party would increase its share of seats in the one hundred and twenty seat knesset
however people feel there is a range of problems that are not being dealt with such as a <unk> economy recent attacks against israelis in jerusalem and this <unk> <unk> war against hamas militants in gaza
netanyahu told reporters tuesday that a divided government was one of israel's problems saying there was a lot of debate <unk> and <unk>
he called out livni for meeting with palestinian authority president mahmoud abbas against his advice and for criticizing building in jerusalem which some say has exacerbated tensions with arabs there
and netanyahu <unk> lapid for calling israel's <unk> of iranian president hassan <unk> u.n. speech a mistake and challenging his push to label israel a jewish state which some fear will <unk> the country's significant arab population
he also accused the ministers of being behind talks to kick out the prime minister
in one word they call this a <unk> netanyahu said
you can not have a government like this
it's impossible to govern like this
in a facebook post tuesday livni said the question in the election will not be who was the first to identify the threats and use them for political means but who will deal with the threats in a responsible level headed manner for the good of the country
<unk> centrist yesh atid party also fired back in a statement in which it said lapid told netanyahu by phone that he expected the prime minister to act <unk> and to stop dragging the and our soldiers into an election for your political needs
yesh atid said that <unk> elections
will harm the economy and israeli society all for narrow political interests and a surrender to the ultra orthodox parties the powerful central committee of the likud and outside lobby groups
a large explosion outside the residence of the iranian ambassador to yemen killed six people and wounded twelve others in sanaa on wednesday
the newly appointed iranian ambassador <unk> <unk> <unk> was not in the building at the time but it's not clear if his family was two interior ministry officials said
all iranian diplomatic personnel were safe and accounted for the <unk> news agency in iran reported
the car bomb went off near the entrance of the diplomatic residence officials said
photos provided to cnn from the scene showed at least two large <unk> blown in the side of the residence with security forces and others walking over <unk> of concrete rubble outside
among those killed were a guard at the residence and a woman and her child who were walking by
no group immediately claimed responsibility for the attack though it has the <unk> of al qaeda officials said
we expect al qaeda to claim responsibility for the attack since they vowed to target and kill houthis and their allies a senior interior ministry official told cnn
houthis are followers of a <unk> of shia islam
iran is predominantly shiite
the newly appointed ambassador arrived in yemen just days ago and has strong links with the houthis
al qaeda the sunni muslim terrorist network has for months threatened to kill houthis after houthi fighters defeated sunni tribes in several provinces

an american woman has died after being stabbed by an unknown attacker in the restroom of a high end mall in abu dhabi the capital of the united arab emirates police said
ibolya ryan forty seven was taken to the hospital after the attack monday on reem island but died of her injuries abu dhabi police said
she worked as a <unk> and had eleven year old <unk> who are being <unk> for by authorities until their father the victim's ex husband <unk> from abroad police said
authorities previously said she was thirty seven
ryan was stabbed with a sharp tool later recovered by police after a fight broke out in the women's restroom according to col. dr. <unk> mohammad <unk> head of the criminal investigation department of abu dhabi police
the cause of the fight remains unknown
the suspect fled the scene immediately after committing the crime he said
police have appealed for help tracking down the <unk>
investigations are still under way to identify the suspect's identity and gender a police statement tuesday said
witnesses reported that the culprit was fully covered wearing an <unk> black <unk> and face cover
the <unk> is a black full length <unk> traditionally worn by local emirati women
the suspect was also wearing a <unk> or <unk>
the u.s. embassy in abu dhabi said it was working with all the appropriate authorities to seek further information about the killing of a u.s. citizen
we offer our condolences to those affected by this terrible tragedy a spokesman said in a statement
the safety and welfare of u.s. citizens abroad is one of the department of state's highest priorities
we stand ready to provide all possible consular assistance
the attack happened at the <unk> mall on reem island a newly developed area of abu dhabi where many western <unk> live
the embassy had issued a statement back in october warning u.s. citizens of an anonymous internet post that encouraged attacks against teachers at american and other international schools
the embassy was unaware of any specific credible threat at that time but called on citizens to be vigilant about their personal security
<unk> footage released by police shows the suspect fully covered walking calmly in through the parking lot entrance speaking to security guards <unk> up a paper and disappearing around the corner out of sight
it then shows the suspect running to the elevator followed by others and getting into the elevator before another clip shows the person leaving the mall through the same parking lot doors
violent crime in the uae is rare and <unk> have expressed shock at the incident
the abu dhabi police will spare no effort in order to <unk> this <unk> crime and bring the culprit to justice said <unk>
syrian president bashar al assad told a french magazine that there haven't been any tangible signs that u.s. led airstrikes in his country have weakened isis despite <unk> wednesday by america's top <unk> that significant progress has been made in <unk> the islamist extremist group
in an interview with paris match a portion of which was published online wednesday al assad said his government has noticed no change in isis since the air campaign began more than two months ago
it isn't true that the strikes are helpful the syrian president said
they would of course have helped had they been serious and efficient
after first striking isis targets in iraq the u.s. led coalition went after the group inside syria in september
these efforts haven't been coordinated with al assad's government which u.s. and other western leaders have said they want replaced even going as far in some cases as supporting and working with moderate opposition forces fighting to <unk> him
yet al assad said in his paris match interview which took place on november twenty eight in damascus and will be published in full thursday that the u.s. led military campaign has limited use because you can't end terrorism with aerial strikes
troops on the ground that know the land and can react are essential
whether or not the strikes have hurt isis there's been little indication that they or anything else has gotten syria closer to an end to a civil war that erupted after mostly peaceful protests in <unk> province in march two thousand and eleven
u.s. secretary of state john kerry however offered a very different view of the anti isis fight wednesday
addressing reporters in brussels belgium after a meeting of representatives from the sixty members of the coalition kerry said various efforts from more than one thousand airstrikes to sanctions have significantly hampered isis in the middle east
there was a consensus that the momentum which it had <unk> two months ago has been <unk> he said
isis has been forced to <unk> its tactics and some of those <unk> are severely <unk> their ability to operate in the way that they were
he added that the coalition has taken important steps in <unk> on the battlefield <unk> its <unk> <unk> laws to <unk> the flow of foreign fighters and <unk> its toxic ideology
the airstrikes are part of that overall strategy and they show no signs of letting up
u.s. central command said that between monday and wednesday of this week there were fourteen coalition airstrikes in syria all of them near kobani the city near the turkish border that in recent weeks has become a key <unk> in the ongoing fight in addition to eleven such strikes inside iraq
the united nations has estimated more than one hundred thousand people have died in the syrian civil war
yet the syrian observatory for human rights says the toll is much higher claiming tuesday that it's more than two hundred thousand people among them about sixty three thousand civilians forty five thousand syrian troops and more than fifty thousand rebel fighters
millions more have been displaced inside syria by the violence with the united nations <unk> up to one point eight million refugees in neighboring lebanon jordan turkey iraq and egypt
and the situation may only get worse after the <unk> world food program earlier this week announced the <unk> of food <unk> for syrian refugees because of a lack of funds
asked by paris match if he'd survive this war or if he would have the same fate as once <unk> but later <unk> leaders <unk> hussein in iraq and <unk> <unk> in libya al assad said the captain doesn't think about death or life he thinks about saving his ship
if he thinks about sinking everyone will die
al assad insisted that his goal has never been to remain president <unk> adding i am doing my best to save the country
regardless what happens we as syrians will never allow our country to become a toy in western hands he said
it is a fundamental principle for us
who is abu bakr al baghdadi
who is <unk> al dulaimi a woman who's been tied to the isis leader
and what would she be doing in lebanon now purportedly in custody of authorities there
those are some of the many questions about reports of the arrest of a woman that regional sources describe as al baghdadi's wife al dulaimi but who iraq's interior ministry said wednesday is anything but
what makes the situation even <unk> is how little is known about al baghdadi
yes he heads the self declared islamic state leading a group that has used brutal tactics think beheading <unk> kidnapping civilians raping women to <unk> vast swaths of syria and iraq
yes he <unk> himself as a spiritual authority as he <unk> efforts to spread his group's extreme form of sharia law to any territory it <unk> and to punish nonbelievers along the way
but al baghdadi the man is a mystery
and so is his family his wife or wives included
which brings us back to the woman being held by lebanese authorities
is she not his wife as the iraqi ministry suggests or perhaps an ex wife as american sources in washington say
or is she a powerful figure heavily involved in isis as a source with knowledge of her arrest told cnn
and if it's the latter what role did she play in the terrorist group
and what was she doing in lebanon a country on the <unk> of syria's years long civil war
she's his wife or his ex wife or neither
the reported detention of a wife and child of al baghdadi has made many wonder who exactly the woman is and what she might know about the terrorist group's inner <unk>
authorities in lebanon where the woman was arrested haven't officially commented on the matter
neither has the cia amid suggestions that western intelligence was involved in her capture
but the iraqi interior ministry citing a source in an intelligence cell under its authority said the woman's identity didn't match up with either of the names it has for al baghdadi's two wives <unk> <unk> mohammed al dulaimi and <unk> <unk> <unk> al <unk>
there is no wife named <unk> al dulaimi the ministry stated <unk> saying al dulaimi is the sister of a man who is imprisoned in iraq and has been sentenced to death for a series of bombings
it doesn't help that baghdadi's family life is <unk> in mystery
a <unk> posted on jihadist websites last year gave little away <unk> simply that he was married
cnn was told that al baghdadi has two wives
the news agency reuters citing tribal sources in iraq said he has three
and isis certainly isn't <unk> anything
some of its members took to social media tuesday to deny that any wife of al baghdadi had been arrested
she <unk> power but how much
if the woman is indeed al dulaimi she is very active in the organization a regional source with knowledge of the operation told cnn
she was reported to have previously been held by the syrian regime of president bashar al assad
in march al dulaimi was released from syrian custody as part of a group of one hundred and fifty women who were freed in return for a group of syrian <unk> an intelligence source told cnn
but her apparent attempt to cross into lebanon with a child at a time when authorities there are <unk> security around the border raises questions about the state of her relationship with al baghdadi
is he <unk> from them
has he fallen out with them
were they escaping from him
asked <unk> <unk> gohel the international security director at the asia pacific foundation
<unk> also remains about how much influence al dulaimi would have had within isis which is known for its <unk> treatment of women
analysts say women who join isis may find their role limited to that of <unk> for jihadi men
but in february isis formed al <unk> a female <unk> with about sixty members whose job is to <unk> women who pass through <unk> and to enforce the <unk> strict <unk> code for women
she could reveal vital intelligence or hardly anything
the arrest of al dulaimi if it was her was a coordinated operation involving intelligence agencies from iraq syria and lebanon an intelligence source familiar with the arrest told cnn
the source said the iraqis had help from the u.s. intelligence community an account <unk> by a second source in the region with knowledge of the operation
but in washington the cia had no comment on the matter
rep. adam <unk> a california <unk> expressed confidence that the united states would be able to gain some intelligence from al dulaimi
we may get insights into al baghdadi's movement who he surrounds himself with whether he was injured and the degree of his injuries he said referring to recent reports that al baghdadi was hurt in airstrikes
not everyone was convinced she would provide a treasure <unk> of insight into isis though
expressing <unk> a former senior u.s. military official told the new york times that in the iraq war the americans captured a wife of abu musab al zarqawi the leader or al qaeda in iraq isis <unk>
we got little out of her and when we sent her back zarqawi killed her the unidentified official told the newspaper
and since al dulaimi was reportedly seized more than a week ago what intelligence she carried may already have passed its sell by date
in military conflicts information <unk> are very immediate and they become <unk> news very quickly said michael <unk> a middle east research fellow at the royal united services institute in london
she was with a son or a daughter
the identity of the child with al dulaimi is still the subject of conflicting reports
an intelligence source told cnn that the child was al <unk> four year old son
other news organizations including agence france presse and the associated press also reported that it was a young boy
but reuters which originally reported the same thing later <unk> its reporting to say that she was with a daughter
the new york times also said it was a daughter rather than a son
<unk> the <unk> one regional source even told cnn that al baghdadi himself has been calling up asking for his son to be released
the full picture of who exactly lebanese authorities have in their custody is still to be revealed
its streets have been so ground down to the <unk> that the prize so small but so intensely fought over is now <unk>
every time you open your eyes in kobani you see the damage
<unk>
explore the devastation of this syrian city
there are people still there but it is hard to <unk> how many
food is <unk> as is fuel for heat
and day and night <unk> <unk> <unk> rain down on kurdish homes isis <unk> a technique it seems from the syrian regime and using domestic gas <unk> and <unk> metal to kill or <unk> civilians
you can hear the <unk> of these metal <unk> <unk> on the street outside as you try to sleep
airstrikes by the u.s. led coalition against isis often three <unk> in rapid succession shake the very ground you are lying on
they have held isis back but not enough for the kurds
from what we saw the front lines appear much more toward the city's center than some kurdish advocates would suggest
to the city's west too isis fighters are <unk> than sometimes <unk>
this is a fight that is still in the balance
to the city's east is the most <unk> <unk> front line
we are led there by <unk> raqqa the <unk> of a twenty two year old kurdish female fighter
in a testament to the <unk> way the kurds live she is this <unk> commander
she has been fighting isis for two years almost since the sunni extremist group's beginning
isis fighters have been as close as five <unk> away from her
she has lost friends here but also made them
read
at least forty fighters killed in syrian city of kobani
i lost a lot of friends in this war and i resist to avenge their death she tells me
no matter the destruction in kobani it can be built again the important thing is to destroy this strange enemy that entered our land
the hardest loss to bear is that of her closest friend <unk> early this year
the kurds have been fighting a lot longer than coalition airstrikes have been falling
i lost my best friend eight months ago
she killed herself to save her friends and the injured around her raqqa said
these are the difficult moments that we live but i told you we gain strength from these martyrs
they are difficult moments that make you do more to avenge their death to make her dreams come true
the road she began you finish
the death itself was <unk> and <unk>
<unk> was surrounded but also injured
her fellow fighters were too
they had used all their ammunition
<unk> pulled back the injured
she advanced while injured and then isis surrounded her
girls are very prized by isis
she blew herself up
she killed a lot of them with her
her last words to me were
we will <unk> our land with the last drop of blood in my body
read
report
children say isis captured beat them on way home from <unk>
amid all the <unk> war usually <unk> it is <unk> to see the defense of this city performed by women in their early twenty s. they are very <unk> in touch with each other often <unk> the <unk> opposite of isis <unk>
kurdish women's resistance will show the world a new history of women in which can break all the rules that have no real basis in customs or traditions said raqqa
but first the fight for kobani
she leads us through a series of <unk> made in the walls of buildings <unk> <unk> by the fighting in the east
one official called the city <unk> after the city whose people and essence the soviet <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to make a point
it is hard to know what will be left to celebrate once the fighting ends but up on the gun position she takes us to the intensity of the battle remains clear
heavy machine guns try to hit isis in the rubble
isis fighters lie dead in the no man's land between the two front lines distant in their <unk> from the glorious death of which isis propaganda often talks
one navy machine gun <unk> repeatedly
this is a war the kurds are still fighting with <unk> <unk> weapons even though <unk> <unk> fall from coalition jets onto their common enemy
their fighters repeated plea is for better <unk>
across no man's land you can hear isis call out <unk> <unk> <unk> god is the greatest the group's common rallying cry
the kurds also muslims <unk> it <unk>
their two views of civilization are almost <unk> apart but now separated by a stretch of <unk> mud increasingly smaller than they would like
finding the most famous chimpanzees in the world is a task that would test the most <unk> of <unk>
reaching the <unk> <unk> of gombe stream national park in tanzania is just the start
a two hour boat ride across the vast waters of lake <unk> follows
finally we <unk> and begin to <unk> through the dense forests of gombe for a further hour before the chimps in question are finally <unk>
<unk> through <unk> towards the <unk> we spy a mother and her two young boys <unk> on palm nuts
it was close to this spot in one thousand nine hundred and sixty that the jane goodall the british <unk> widely regarded as the world's foremost expert on chimpanzees began her near fifty five year study of one specially <unk> <unk> family
goodall now eighty years old would sit for hours and observe the complex social structures and <unk> of her subjects
the research of that one family and the subsequent generations it has <unk> continues to this day providing ever more <unk> insights into the behavior of the closest living relatives of human beings
the magic of gombe is two factors said <unk> <unk> a <unk> candidate at the jane goodall institute research center here to study the chimps
it's the opportunity to be here with a well <unk> group of chimpanzees to come into the forest every day with <unk> field <unk>
it's the long term data because jane goodall started this study in the early sixty s
we have this incredible opportunity to know the chimps here now and also their mothers and fathers and their <unk> and all this incredible information that we have on them
researchers like <unk> come from all over the world to study the chimps at gombe
there are an estimated one hundred chimpanzees there today broken up into three different communities
the group goodall studied has the most with around sixty members
even after fifty plus years researchers are still surprised by what they learn
before the program began chimpanzees were thought to be <unk> but goodall saw them hunting monkeys and eating meat
this is a <unk> we observe as we watch a group of chimps track <unk> monkeys <unk> in the trees above them
we also see another <unk> bunch fashion tools to try <unk> <unk> from beneath a <unk>
according to senior researcher at the jane goodall foundation dr anthony <unk> activities like these display a high level of intelligence
they're so much like humans
there are so many <unk> in what they do the relationships they have to each other just all kinds of ways there are <unk> communications between them <unk> said
he points to the example of how chimps will look to <unk> and embrace one another after a fight or confrontation
they have <unk> and forgiveness of things which go wrong he said
despite the <unk> and genetic <unk> however the chimps <unk> to rural human settlements can often be <unk> and <unk> to their own well being
in some places that they live there are lions <unk> <unk>
but on the whole probably their main enemy is something like me humans <unk> continued
people hunt chimps for eating some places they get <unk> of chimps for <unk> even <unk> and for a while there was a trade in baby chimps for their medical research and things like <unk> and <unk>
in the dense forest and <unk> of gombe chimpanzees and other species are protected from the most destructive aspects of human behavior
but that's not always the case in other sectors of the <unk> bush where large <unk> of land have been transformed for <unk> purposes
this has resulted in a huge number of trees being cut down that would otherwise offer shelter for communities of chimpanzees
sadly the best <unk> for chimps are often also the best habitat for the likes of <unk> <unk>
recognizing these problems the jane goodall institute is working to teach the local population about sustainable farming so the forest is preserved
through the gombe <unk> program they aim to show villagers that sustainable <unk> techniques can bring both more income and a more vibrant habitat for all species
preventing <unk> also has the knock on effect of ensuring <unk> from the forest continue to run into lake <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> ecosystem beneath the water and the trade of the fisherman in <unk> communities as a result
these deep environmental connections are enough to convince some that chimpanzees are key to the future of rural tanzania
in my opinion chimps are important for the country's economic growth said <unk> <unk> <unk> a gombe <unk> program forest officer
they can be used as a national symbol for tourist <unk> into this area of tanzania <unk> income which should later be used for sustainable development of the communities
they are also important in that their habitat if well <unk> can act as good <unk> covering for the forest

that's a sentiment that jane goodall herself would be sure to <unk>
one day after executing dozens of non muslims at a quarry in kenya the islamist militant group al shabaab <unk> an attack in its home base of somalia killing at least four people according to police in an attack on a united nations convoy
three of those killed in wednesday <unk> attack near <unk> airport were civilians and another was a security force member police col. mohamed hassan said
i saw at least two dead bodies lying in a pool of blood on the ground and police arrived soon at the area and began shooting in the air to disperse the crowds a witness named <unk> said by phone from the scene
a <unk> of black smoke could be seen rising from the airport which also acts as a staging ground for united nations operations and for the african union troops on a <unk> mission in somalia
two united nations vehicles were damaged a u.n. official said but no u.n. staff members were killed or injured
al shabaab claimed responsibility for what spokesman sheikh <unk> abu musab called a sacred bomb attack targeting foreign <unk> and u.n. staff
abu musab said this action had claimed the lives of several somali soldiers and foreigners working with u.n. but he did not specify a number of dead or their <unk>
such violence in somalia and carried out by al shabaab is hardly unprecedented
the group has been active in east africa for years waging an armed campaign that initially aimed to turn somalia into a fundamentalist islamic state according to the council on foreign relations
yet al shabaab which the united states designated as a foreign terrorist organization in march two thousand and eight hasn't confined its targets to somali authorities
its militants have also killed international aid workers journalists civilian leaders and african union <unk>
somali and allied au forces have pushed back even forcing al shabaab from its last major stronghold in <unk> in early october according to residents and military commanders
yet they haven't stopped the group entirely as <unk> by a deadly car bombing outside a popular mogadishu restaurant one week after that <unk>
and it's not as though al shabaab is <unk> itself to somalia
the terrorist group whose then leader ahmed godane pledged allegiance to al qaeda in two thousand and twelve has been active elsewhere in africa as well
its bombers attacked bars and restaurants in the <unk> capital of <unk> on the night of the two thousand and ten world cup final killing more than sixty people
and last fall al shabaab militants <unk> walked into the <unk> <unk> mall in <unk> kenya and began <unk> down shoppers allegedly <unk> some hostages before killing them
the four day long siege ended with as many as sixty seven dead and parts of the mall destroyed
last month authorities said at least twenty eight died after al shabaab <unk> a bus in kenya and sprayed bullets on those who failed to <unk> quran <unk>
and on tuesday the group's militants raided a quarry in the kenyan village of <unk> near the somali border <unk> non muslim workers from their muslim counterparts and executing them group spokesman sheikh ali <unk> said in a statement read on a pro al shabaab radio station in somalia
at least thirty six bodies were found dumped in the quarry according to the kenyan red cross
three co founders of a pro democracy organization that's been <unk> for weeks in hong kong reported to police wednesday though other groups hunger <unk> among them remain out in force demanding sweeping reforms on the island
the three leaders of occupy central with love and peace all middle aged men announced their intention to surrender to police a day earlier and encouraged student protesters to stand down too
but their younger counterparts aren't <unk> for the time being despite the recent loss of one key protest site and clashes with police at the demonstrators main <unk> earlier this week
for the sake of the <unk> safety for the sake of our original intention of love and peace as we prepare to surrender we three urge the students to retreat <unk> tai one of the three occupy co founders said at a news conference tuesday
tai a law professor first came up with the idea to occupy downtown hong kong to call for universal <unk> but he has not always been on the same page as student leaders who launched the current protests two months ago
those other groups scholarism and the hong kong federation of students haven't given any indication they will <unk> in their demands chief among them that citizens be allowed to <unk> their next leader from an open field of candidates rather than those <unk> by a committee loyal to the chinese government
earlier this fall the two groups even <unk> an open letter urging chinese president xi jinping to closely consider their cause
there will only be more citizens <unk> with our <unk> institutions marching and protesting as long as no genuine democracy is practiced in this place they wrote
some scholarism members are waging a hunger strike in an effort to secure talks with the hong kong government to demand democracy
yet in a statement wednesday chief executive <unk>
<unk> office urged them to take good care of their health and said that expressing views on constitutional reform through illegal and <unk> means is bound to be <unk>
the request by some scholarism members to conduct dialogue with the government on <unk> constitutional reform will not and could not be by the government it is <unk> and has <unk> the legal procedures <unk> office said
tai and the other two co founders chan <unk> man and <unk> <unk> <unk> left the police station in central hong kong after about an hour wednesday
tai told reporters outside that they were asked to record their particular offenses committed during the protest movement and then told they were free to go
he said they were not given a date of when they need to return to the police station
police said twenty four people ages thirty three to eighty two <unk> at the police station wednesday for the offense of taking part in an <unk> assembly
many of the people taking part in the <unk> protest movement do not consider the occupy founders to be their leaders and they are unlikely to be influenced by <unk> call for retreat

the united states and iran may be bombing a common enemy in iraq one whom they both <unk> isis
recent media reports from the region claim iran's military conducted air raids in eastern iraq and on tuesday a spokesman for the pentagon said the reports might be true
we have indications that they have flown these missions in recent days these airstrikes in eastern iraq rear <unk> john kirby told cnn's wolf <unk>
no coordination u.s. says
is iran <unk> with the u.s. led coalition fighting the sunni islamist extremists
<unk> no came the answer from both sides
the u.s. is not working with iran's military and it is not even directly <unk> with it over operations in the country kirby said
we are not <unk> with nor are we <unk> with iranian military he said
both sides are leaving it to iraq to manage their movements in iraqi airspace and keep them both out of each <unk> hair
speaking from brussels belgium u.s. secretary of state john kerry didn't confirm or deny iran's military action saying that's up to the iraqi or iranian government
but he did say that while the united states is <unk> its military action with iraqi authorities nothing has changed as far as its lack of coordination with iran
i think it's self evident that if iran is taking in some particular place and it's confined to taking on and it has an impact it's going to be a net effect that is positive kerry said
but it's not something we're <unk>
a high ranking iranian military official also <unk> rejected the notion that there may have been any coordinated bombing and he attacked the united states in his comments
the islamic republic of iran <unk> the united states as the root cause of <unk> and problems as well as the terrorist actions of <unk> in iraq gen. <unk> <unk> told the government approved <unk> news agency adding that iran wants u.s. influence to completely <unk>
in another <unk> report the head of iran's revolutionary guard characterized the united states as an enemy not an ally
today the americans are in a strategic dead end and have experienced all possible options and <unk> against the islamic revolution but couldn't <unk> their <unk> goals maj. gen. mohammad ali <unk> said
the u.s. capabilities can no more be expanded and their <unk> for <unk> a change have reached the level of <unk> meaning that the u.s. is left with no more option but <unk> the islamic republic of iran's real power
yet isis is one of few issues that iran and the united states agree on
both countries want to <unk> the terror group that has been taking over large swaths of iraq and syria
but with no diplomatic relations with iran and <unk> concerns about its nuclear program the united states has had to walk a <unk> over iran's involvement
this was reflected in comments that u.s. president barack obama made to <unk> face the nation
there is some <unk> in the sense that since they have some troops or militias they control in and around baghdad
we let them know don't mess with us
we're not here to mess with you
we're focused on our common enemy obama said
word of iranian participation in the fight against isis is nothing new
a military official in iran has said the world can thank his country that isis has not been able to assault baghdad
the terrorists sought to surround baghdad but they failed in reaching their <unk> goals thanks to iran's supports brig
gen. <unk> <unk> told <unk>
<unk> is <unk> commander of the <unk> force an elite unit of iran's revolutionary guard corps
according to <unk> senior military officials in baghdad said the <unk> force helped free the iraqi town of <unk> al <unk> from isis control
but the common interest is complicated by <unk> interests
the united states wants to put an end to all islamist extremism and in the past it has accused tehran of <unk> terrorism
iran itself is an islamic republic <unk> by <unk> islamic law
but the state religion is shia islam which sunni muslim extremists such as isis consider <unk>
in neighboring iraq there is a tense and at times violent <unk> between shia and sunni factions with the former <unk> in government
iran has close ties to the shia <unk>
that has <unk> fears in washington that iran's involvement could not only <unk> isis but could also drive the <unk> between iraqis deeper
we want nothing to be done that further <unk> sectarian tensions in the country kirby said of iranian military actions
iran is also a close ally of syrian dictator bashar al assad who is battling isis as well
beating back isis would take some pressure off of his troops
the united states is calling for al assad's removal
a short circuit has <unk> part of a nuclear power plant in southeastern ukraine causing power shortages in parts of the country but putting no one in danger of radiation the country's newly appointed energy minister said wednesday
the incident at the plant in <unk> happened last week and emergency <unk> should be finished by friday the energy ministry said
there is no threat to the <unk> energy minister <unk> <unk> said
this is a technical problem that is currently being <unk>
the short circuit happened in a power <unk> system he said
information on what caused the problem in the <unk> third block wasn't immediately available
low temperatures had recently caused an increase in demand for power the ministry said in a written statement earlier this week
the <unk> of the power supply is due to the emergency <unk> of the energy unit three in <unk> nuclear power plant as well as <unk> supplies of coal in the power plants <unk> the energy ministry said in a statement tuesday
the situation is under control and the unit will be under <unk> until december five th
a ministry spokeswoman told cnn that the incident happened friday but was announced only on tuesday because people started asking about the power shortages
the media office of <unk> the state nuclear power plant operator said the internal <unk> safety system cut off the <unk> for the <unk> third unit
<unk> is europe's largest nuclear power plant according to <unk>
it has been operating since one thousand nine hundred and eighty four with the third unit brought online in one thousand nine hundred and eighty six
it has six power units altogether with a total capacity of six thousand <unk>
<unk> is in territory controlled by the ukrainian government in kiev
it is about two hundred kilometers west of the city of donetsk which is a stronghold of pro russian rebels that have been battling ukrainian forces for months in southeastern ukraine
the plant is about five hundred and twenty kilometers southeast of chernobyl the ukrainian community where a nuclear power plant <unk> exploded when ukraine was part of the soviet union in one thousand nine hundred and eighty six
it is estimated that more than four thousand <unk> workers died and close to seventy thousand were disabled from radiation related causes
according to the united nations the explosion and fire that occurred at chernobyl affected directly or <unk> nine million people because of <unk> materials released into the atmosphere
these are just some of the objects confiscated by polish customs officers and documented by adam lach a photographer and filmmaker at <unk> images
for lach the illegal wildlife trade <unk> the devastation that can result from human <unk> which like <unk> can destroy all we have around us
lach first learned about the <unk> trade when he was a teenager in the one thousand nine hundred and ninety s. he was shocked by the stories he heard
but it was seeing an exhibit of <unk> animal goods items seized by customs officials at an airport in <unk> poland that prompted him to <unk> on his <unk> project human tsunami
i am not an <unk> but in our world we have the belief that we are the only valuable existence on planet earth and this is not acceptable lach said
the relation of men towards animals and nature is a reflection of the characteristics of the whole human population as we still allow crimes against animals and nature
we do not understand that <unk> the planet translates into respect of the people for themselves
let us keep balance and let us use only what we need to live by
cutting off the leg of an elephant and using it as a trash can is a testament to our hypocrisy
<unk> pictures were mostly taken over a two week period although he <unk> taking more in the future
some of the specimens shown were confiscated years ago at the <unk> airport which placed its exhibit in the middle of the <unk> terminal to raise awareness of the problem
<unk> images are not a story about a particular airport he said but they reflect a wider issue
through these photographs i will try to <unk> people and make them aware that they are often part of the problem he said
this project aims to show human <unk> and <unk> and to build in us <unk>
in my work i often use the sense of peace and <unk> in the photographs
i avoid screaming images
<unk> the idea of a black background i wanted to <unk> these <unk> to give them the rank of authenticity and pain
i wanted to pass on as well how uncomfortable i felt when i had to touch and set up these <unk> to be photographed or listen to horror stories of the customs officers
one story that stood out in particular for lach was that of a rapid decline in a <unk> species surrounding indonesia
this decline came suddenly out of nowhere he recounted
a short time afterwards the polish customs officers intercepted a cargo of dried <unk>
it turned out that some indonesian company <unk> them to poland as <unk> <unk> a total of twenty seven tons of <unk>
how many <unk> had to die to produce twenty seven tons of <unk>
millions
that almost threatened the extinction of the entire population perhaps even more than one species
it shows how easy it is to cause <unk> damage to nature and how <unk> we are
polish customs officers have done well in combating the trade lach said
they no longer find <unk> boxes filled with hundreds of <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> tied up birds or <unk> of <unk> and <unk> that are <unk> so full that only half survived the trip he said
now smuggling efforts are more likely to involve someone trying to transport a baby <unk> or pass off a <unk> an african wild cat as a domestic cat he said
at first glance it seems therefore that it is better
but it is not lach said
this illegal trade is running as before even faster only ever more <unk>
before this trade <unk> in markets and pet stores while today <unk> often use the internet
it is not only <unk> but also safer
the merchant offers for sale one or two pieces sends them by <unk> and if there is a <unk> the loss is small
the criminal responsibility is smaller too because it deals with smuggling a single <unk>
illegal <unk> favor the internet
a global network does not recognize borders
today lach said anyone with an internet connection can visit the traffickers websites
the only <unk> is language he said
one who knows languages can buy everything

an appeals judge in qatar on sunday cleared matthew and grace huang of starving their adopted daughter to death in two thousand and thirteen in a case that drew global attention to that country's justice system
the huangs were blocked from leaving qatar on sunday at <unk> international airport by immigration officials who confiscated their passports according to the doha news agency citing family spokesman eric volz
diplomatic sources said monday the departure was delayed due only to legal procedures that take place once people have been cleared of a crime
on tuesday u.s
ambassador to qatar <unk> smith said a travel ban against the couple was lifted following a motion that was filed monday and after talks between smith and top qatari officials
the huangs who were living in qatar while matthew huang worked for an international company that was <unk> sites for the two thousand and twenty two world cup were arrested in january two thousand and thirteen when their eight year old daughter gloria died
they were charged with starving her to death convicted in march and sentenced to three years in prison

the couple spent nearly a year in prison before being freed in november two thousand and thirteen to <unk> proceedings surrounding an appeal that they filed
<unk> judge <unk> al <unk> overturned the conviction on sunday citing <unk> in forensic reports and saying the trial judge failed to properly consider testimony from witnesses who said gloria wasn't deprived
a report by pathologists hired by the defense obtained by cnn stated they found no evidence that tissue samples were taken from <unk> body after her death despite the fact qatari investigators submitted an autopsy report
advocates for the huangs suggested the lab report was fabricated and said their request with the qatari judiciary for a formal investigation went unanswered

they have since been sent back to the united states to live with grace <unk> mother
israel will soon have new elections after its prime minister called for the <unk> of two critical members of his coalition cabinet and announced he'd call for the <unk> of the nation's <unk> his office announced tuesday
prime minister benjamin netanyahu ordered letters of <unk> for finance minister <unk> lapid and justice minister <unk> livni two members of his cabinet from rival parties according to a statement from his office
during the last few weeks and in particular the last few days the ministers have intensely attacked the government that i am leading netanyahu said
i will not tolerate ministers attacking the government's policy and its head from inside the government
the moves come at a <unk> time in israel which has been <unk> by a number of recent terrorist attacks against citizens in jerusalem
the head of the right wing likud party netanyahu has been israel's prime minister since two thousand and nine
but he's had to rely on members of other parties many of them to the left of likud on the political <unk> to govern
his likud party for instance won more seats than any other party in the january two thousand and thirteen election but still fell well short of the sixty needed to have a majority in the knesset
he ended up bringing on other parties into his government
the first to join was the movement a centrist party led by livni a former opposition leader and foreign minister
<unk> a <unk> journalist turned politician became another key player after his centrist yesh atid party finished a surprising second in that national election
netanyahu told reporters tuesday a divided government was one of israel's problems saying there was a lot of debate <unk> and <unk>
he called out livni for meeting with palestinian authority president mahmoud abbas against his recommendation and for criticizing building in jerusalem which some say has exacerbated tensions with arabs there
and netanyahu <unk> lapid for calling israel's <unk> of iranian president hassan <unk> u.n. speech a mistake and challenging his push to label israel a jewish state which some fear will <unk> the country's significant arab population
he also accused the ministers of being behind talks to kick out the prime minister
in one word they call this a <unk> netanyahu said
you can not have a government like this
it's impossible to govern like this
in a facebook post tuesday livni said the question in the election will not be who was the first to identify the threats and use them for political means but who will deal with the threats in a responsible level headed manner for the good of the country
yesh atid also fired back in a statement in which it said lapid told netanyahu by phone that he expected the prime minister to act <unk> and to stop dragging the and our soldiers into an election for your political needs
yesh atid claimed that <unk> elections
will harm the economy and israeli society all for narrow political interests and a surrender to the ultra orthodox parties the powerful central committee of the likud and outside lobby groups
prime minister netanyahu has failed in his management of the country and in dealing with the needs of the israeli public the yesh atid party said
the firing of ministers is an act of <unk> and loss of control
pope francis said on tuesday that modern slavery is a crime against humanity and is unfortunately becoming worse and worse every day
this takes place in hiding behind closed doors in private homes in the streets in the cars in factories in the fields in fishing boats and in so many other places the pope said through an interpreter during a panel discussion tuesday led by cnn's christiane amanpour
this takes place both in cities and in villages in villages of the richest and the poorest nations on earth
a diverse group of faith leaders gathered at the vatican on tuesday to sign a declaration pledging to inspire spiritual and practical action by all global faiths and people of good will everywhere to <unk> slavery by the year two thousand and twenty
leaders and representatives of catholic <unk> and orthodox christianity judaism shiite and sunni islam buddhism and <unk> all were present and signed the initiative
cnn has <unk> the cause of <unk> slavery having launched its freedom project in march two thousand and eleven
an estimated thirty five point eight million people are <unk> according to the global slavery index
as the pope pointed out the problem is far from limited to developing countries
more than sixty thousand people are estimated to be <unk> in the united states more than ten thousand in germany and more than one thousand in <unk>
most victims in europe and central asia are forced into sexual <unk> the united nations says
in east asia and the pacific region most are used for forced labor
the victims come from all walks of life but most times they are the poorest and the most vulnerable of our brothers and sisters francis said

today we have the opportunity awareness <unk> innovation and technology to achieve this human and moral <unk> it states
new dna tests reveal britain's long lost king richard iii was blue eyed and likely <unk> <unk> but they also raise <unk> questions over whether he and other monarchs before and since should have been on the throne at all
experts <unk> the case of the king in the car park a set of remains dug up from beneath a parking lot in the central english city of <unk> in two thousand and twelve now say they are ninety nine point nine nine nine percents positive that the bones are those of richard iii who died at the battle of <unk> in one thousand four hundred and eighty five
genetic specialist <unk> king from the university of <unk> said analysis of various genetic <unk> offered <unk> clues to richard <unk> appearance suggesting that he was not the dark <unk> <unk> eyed monarch portrayed in well known historical images
there are <unk> that we know are involved in <unk> for hair and eye color
the genetic evidence shows he had a ninety six percents probability of having blue eyes and a seventy seven percents probability of having <unk> hair though this can <unk> with age
while there are no contemporary portraits of richard all known works post date his death by at least twenty five to thirty years leaving the artists who painted them open to charges that they were influenced by propaganda the dna findings suggest the <unk> <unk> portrait of richard owned by the society of <unk> of london is the closest to his real appearance
king said the latest scientific evidence combined with <unk> analysis published in nature communications and funded by the <unk> trust and <unk> trust provided overwhelming proof of the <unk> identity
at its most conservative it's ninety nine point nine nine nine percents certain she explained
the <unk> <unk> is six point seven million to one that these are <unk> remains
but while detailed genetic testing and <unk> <unk> research helped confirm that one living relative on <unk> female line michael <unk> was an exact match to his <unk> dna and found a second previously unknown but near perfect <unk> match in new zealand born <unk> <unk> <unk> scientists weren't able to trace a living relative on the male line using the y <unk>
and that has raised an <unk> possibility
that neither he nor many other monarchs actually had a cast iron claim to the throne
<unk> expert <unk> <unk> said it had been relatively <unk> to trace potential living relatives of richard iii along the male line since records of the <unk> britain's <unk> made it simple to follow such families back century after century
but once five potential living relatives from the male line linking richard iii to his predecessor edward iii and back down the generations via john of <unk> and henry <unk> the fifth duke of <unk> had been identified things became more complicated
one of the five was quickly <unk> from the <unk> because his y <unk> dna did not match the other four suggesting a relatively recent false <unk> event and when king carried out checks on the y <unk> dna of the remaining four she discovered there was no match there either revealing at least one other case of false <unk> in the generations of fathers and sons leading back to edward iii
we can't tell you where that break is because we simply don't know it could be at any one of the nineteen links in the chain between those two individuals <unk> said adding that while each link in that chain was equally likely to be the one which was broken if the break occurred in the first few generations around richard iii it could bring various monarchs right to rule into question
there are some well known and important people on that chain he said
you have two monarchs richard and edward iii
if the break occurred on the <unk> line
then that might raise questions about the legitimacy of the <unk> claim to the throne
the <unk> line comes through john of <unk> side of the family
so if the break were on that side it raises questions about the legitimacy of the <unk> monarchs and because there was a <unk> link to that line as well also the <unk>
but he said the <unk> also had another argument for their right to rule since they took the throne by force at the battle of <unk>
and he was quick to point out that whatever the implications of the latest discovery current monarch queen elizabeth <unk> position was secure
we're certainly not saying the house of <unk> has no legitimate claim to the throne far from it <unk> explained
royal succession doesn't work like that
there is no <unk> succession line between edward iii and elizabeth ii
yes they are related but the whole point of monarchy is that over several centuries it takes various <unk> and turns
monarchy is about opportunity and chance as much as it is about <unk>

lebanese authorities have arrested a wife of isis leader abu bakr al baghdadi the man <unk> the islamist terror group's sweeping rampage across syria and iraq said a source with knowledge of the arrest
the woman is one of al baghdadi's two wives
her arrest came as part of a planned operation according to the source
the source described her as a powerful figure heavily involved in isis
not much is known about the reported wife including what her involvement is with the terrorist group if any
we will gain some intelligence from her
we may get insights into al baghdadi's movement who he surrounds himself with whether he was injured and the degree of his injuries said rep. adam <unk> a california <unk>
another intelligence source identified the wife as <unk> al dulaimi
she was detained with her four year old son more than a week ago when they tried to enter lebanon that source said
the arrest was a coordinated operation involving agencies from iraq syria and lebanon said the intelligence source
the source said the iraqis had help from u.s. intelligence
in washington the cia declined to comment
also in washington several american sources suggested the person arrested was al baghdadi's ex wife not a current one
al baghdadi has been calling for the release of his son the intelligence source said adding that al dulaimi was released from syrian custody in march as part of a group of one hundred and fifty women who were freed in exchange for a group of syrian <unk>
the greek orthodox <unk> had been kidnapped and held captive by the al qaeda linked al nusra front which al baghdadi had helped establish
lebanese authorities didn't immediately respond to requests for comment from cnn
agence france presse citing unidentified lebanese security officials reported one of al baghdadi's sons was detained
but reuters also citing lebanese officials said that a daughter rather than a son was being held
the two agencies similarly <unk> on when the two were picked up by lebanese forces
reuters said it happened in recent days
afp reported it was ten days ago
regardless the very idea that a government may be holding close relatives of al baghdadi is significant given his <unk> role in isis <unk> rise the extremist group's widely <unk> tactics under his leadership and the <unk> of the international coalition aimed at <unk> isis
it's certainly a new dynamic because we've never seen anybody connected so close to al baghdadi being detained terrorism expert <unk> <unk> gohel said
at the same time the reports raise a lot of questions such as what the family members might have been doing in lebanon
is he <unk> from them
has he fallen out with them
were they escaping from him
asked gohel who is the international security director at the asia pacific foundation
lebanon is one of several countries heavily affected by syria's <unk> conflict and the flood of refugees trying to escape the violence
lebanese authorities have been cracking down very heavily on the border to prevent members of isis <unk> into lebanon gohel said
they don't want the problems <unk> over from iraq and syria into their territory
another question raised by the reports is whether the wife is affiliated with isis
if she's simply an ex wife the first thing you got to deal with is she's an innocent person potentially who was married to a bad guy with a child said philip <unk> a former cia counterterrorism official
the first <unk>
before we deal with what she knows is how closely was she affiliated and how hard can you press her based on that <unk>
that's an ethical question he said
mystery surrounds arrest of woman who may be isis <unk> wife
isis <unk> after al baghdadi took over
the group that in two thousand and six would become isis began in iraq where it targeted the u.s. led coalition as well as shiite muslims in the country
it suffered heavy losses but ascended over the past few years to take advantage of a <unk> <unk> by syria's civil war as well as instability in iraq
not <unk> this all happened after al baghdadi took over isis in two thousand and ten
before that he'd been at a u.s. prison camp for insurgents at <unk> in southern iraq where he was taken after being detained in february two thousand and four amid fighting in the <unk> city of <unk>
media reports have claimed u.s. authorities held al baghdadi for four years
but the pentagon has offered a different time line saying he was at camp <unk> until early december two thousand and four when officials there recommended his <unk> release
beyond this little is known about al baghdadi
according to the u.s. government he was born in <unk> iraq and is in his early forty s. what <unk> him how he was trained and who he's close to including his family largely remains a mystery
he has emerged from the <unk> in <unk> and <unk>
after the death of al qaeda leader osama bin laden in two thousand and eleven al baghdadi issued a <unk> in which he threatened violent retribution
there were <unk> suggestions last month that al baghdadi had been wounded in airstrikes in northern iraq
but days later an audio recording emerged that purportedly contained a message from al baghdadi saying the u.s. led coalition to destroy isis is terrified weak and powerless
isis itself has never been more powerful having taken over vast swaths of territory in iraq and syria in the past few years
and it has used brutal tactics to do so such as mass kidnappings <unk> killings and other abuses against civilians and fighting <unk> alike actions that a u.n. panel characterized as war crimes and crimes against humanity
al baghdadi who has gone by a variety of <unk> during his career in terrorism has been at the center of it
the u.s. state <unk> <unk> for justice program which refers to him as abu <unk> offers ten million dollar for information leading to his arrest
when his group <unk> itself as the islamic state in june al baghdadi was <unk> as spiritual leader of the new caliphate
he's sought to <unk> his <unk> <unk> with a <unk> posted on jihadist websites last year claiming he had earned a <unk> in islamic studies from a university in baghdad
his knowledge in islamic <unk> is somewhat <unk> but nevertheless he's created this <unk> and this <unk> behind him gohel said
save me
a man's voice <unk> out in the darkness
please save me
i can't see you she <unk>
i don't know where you are
save me
please save me
the voice <unk> again
i want to she says
but i can't move either
when she <unk> the voice is gone
in that <unk> dark grave under seven hundred tons of concrete and steel she is all alone
the concept of <unk> isn't familiar to most <unk>
but the way reshma describes her seventeen <unk> days buried underground in pitch black darkness as the voices around her <unk> away as <unk> days <unk> into <unk> nights as she questioned whether she was in this world or the next it's an <unk> one
i'd <unk> <unk> and sleep
i would wake up and <unk> again reshma recounted her voice barely <unk> as she spoke to cnn on tuesday
it was one of her first extended one on one interviews since rescuers pulled her out alive last week from the rubble of a collapsed building
i told god take me if that's your will
if not then save me
but don't leave me here like this
how did she survive
the youngest in the family is often the most <unk>
and reshma the fifth child of her mother <unk> always had an independent <unk>
when she was little she <unk> rolling a <unk> down the street with the boys to dressing up <unk> with the girls
as a teen she surprised her family by <unk> a man several years her elder
she was in love she told them and love has no boundaries
we accepted him <unk> said
but he wasn't good to her
he'd tell her that her family hadn't paid enough in <unk>
he'd <unk> her that he'd take another wife
and said her mother he <unk> her
we gave as much as we could she said
but it wasn't enough
in june two thousand and ten the couple moved from <unk> to <unk> the go to destination for the <unk> looking to change their fortunes
a garment worker himself the husband persuaded reshma to join the trade
the money was good
and he <unk> that <unk> make up for what her parents weren't paying him <unk> said
unable to afford rent on her own reshma moved to a tiny room in a house next to the <unk> <unk> bus stop
<unk> once an <unk> <unk> <unk> of land just outside <unk> has grown into a chaotic <unk> <unk> home to a <unk> number of the country's four thousand five hundred garment factories
and reshma quickly found a job at rana plaza a <unk> nine story city block sized structure that housed shops a bank and five garment workshops
the sixty dollar she earned a month was twice the average for garment workers in bangladesh
still the loss of her husband's additional <unk> meant she barely <unk> by
i have to find a way to <unk> this off reshma thinks
her long dark hair is caught under a <unk> of concrete
every time she tries to move large <unk> of hair are pulled out of her head
she feels around in the darkness to see what she can find
she is now free to explore on her hands and knees this dust <unk> <unk>
when the first <unk> appeared in the <unk> walls of rana plaza the news spread among the workers in quick <unk>
the building was built without the right permits on land that used to be a <unk> officials now say
the weak foundation was threatened even further when the owner added four floors to what was once a five story structure
<unk> <unk> on the fourth floor sometimes so <unk> that workers said they could feel the structure <unk>
but all this was revealed after the fact
after rana plaza <unk> on april twenty four
after it claimed more than one thousand one hundred lives
on april twenty three the owner <unk> rana called in an engineer to <unk> the building and <unk> worker concerns
the engineer officials later said took one look at support pillars on the third floor and was <unk>
the <unk> were deep and many
the building is <unk> he said
no one should be inside
this building will stand a hundred years he <unk> that day
the factory owners were relieved
political unrest in the country has meant frequent general strikes and a <unk> of orders for them
they couldn't afford a work <unk> if they intended to keep their foreign clients happy
the industry <unk> more than twenty billion dollar a year making the country the second largest <unk> of clothing after china
so they gave the workers an ultimatum
miss work miss pay
the next morning at work reshma and others checked out the <unk>
they looked <unk>
the <unk> said that's just water damage
go back to work she said
she did taking her spot among the long rows of <unk> machines at new wave <unk>
an hour later the power failed
then came a loud <unk>
pillars crashed
support <unk> punched through windows
dust and debris <unk> the air
the ceiling <unk> toward reshma
and the floors gave way
then she <unk> out
reshma <unk> across the rubble with the little strength she can muster
water she tells herself
i have to find water
she'd found a little in a bottle soon after the fall
but how long ago was that
hours
days
weeks
in this darkness she can't tell
the <unk> <unk> around her stopped a long time ago
the man who'd begged her for help was the last voice
she <unk> through the <unk> her clothing <unk> to <unk>
she <unk> <unk> with a rod
one tiny space leads to another
each an air pocket within the <unk> structure
she <unk> for food
the four <unk> she'd found in the ruins and <unk> carefully are gone
what she really needs is water
with <unk> <unk> she <unk> it down her <unk> throat
i didn't know if it was <unk> or dirty water or what type of water she later says
it didn't matter
she doesn't know it but she's in the <unk> <unk> of rana plaza
it's one hundred and seventy miles from <unk> to <unk> a <unk> along <unk> roads that can take up to ten hours
<unk> mother heard of the collapse on tv
but there was no way for her to reach her daughter
reshma had sold her mobile phone three days earlier to help pay rent
<unk> up what little change she had lying around <unk> boarded a bus to the capital
she checked the <unk> and the hospitals
she showed a picture of reshma to every <unk> she met
no one had seen her
for the first few days she steadfastly held on to hope
rescuers had been pulling out survivors from the rubble by the dozens each day
more than two thousand of them in all
but as the days passed the number <unk>
and with it died <unk> hopes
she <unk> <unk> around the disaster site
strangers brought her rice offered her an umbrella <unk> her
i wanted my daughter's body she said
i wanted a leg or an arm or anything that i could take home and bury
three minutes without air
three days without water
three weeks without food
that's the survival rule of <unk>
in <unk> case circumstances <unk> to keep her alive
the air that <unk> into the <unk>
the <unk> she found
the water she <unk>
the complete darkness may have helped too doctors say
without knowing day from night she couldn't keep track of time
she didn't know officials had determined there was little chance someone could survive past a week under that <unk> pile
she was unaware that the rescue mission had long given way to an operation to recover the dead
and sometimes the not knowing keeps one going
what was that
reshma <unk>
she <unk> to hear
there it is again the <unk> <unk> of the muslim call to prayer
<unk> the sound coming from
<unk> the sound coming from
she keeps asking herself
with a new urgency she <unk> on the walls of <unk> metal and <unk> around her
then she sees a <unk> of light
<unk>
<unk>
she calls out
save me
save me
but no one <unk> her
she takes another rod
with all her might she <unk> it through an opening above her
allah she keeps saying
allah save me
it wasn't lost on lt. col. <unk> <unk> that the mood at the disaster site was changing
determination was slowly giving way to <unk>
the <unk> <unk> of death <unk> the air
rescue workers covered their faces with t <unk> to escape the <unk> of <unk> <unk>
it <unk> into their clothes <unk> inside their skin and <unk>
each body they pulled out took an emotional toll as well
the number of volunteers had <unk>
by friday rescuers had finished <unk> the rubble and were <unk> their way to the <unk> <unk>
the recovery operation was almost over
they hadn't found a survivor in almost a week
then someone noticed a rod <unk> out from an opening waving wildly
<unk> with <unk> <unk> with wonder they rushed to the spot
someone was down there alive
she kept saying save me save me <unk> said
we told her we weren't going anywhere
a <unk> went through the crowds that had gathered at the sight
television channels immediately switched to live coverage
<unk> god you make anything possible said a man on a <unk> as he urged others to pray
please help us save her
for forty five minutes workers used hand <unk> and light <unk> to remove concrete blocks
wait wait we're coming for you
minutes from rescue reshma finds herself facing a very ordinary <unk>
how am i going to come out in front of all these people with no clothes
she thinks
i'm a lady
<unk> had ripped to <unk> from all the <unk>
a <unk> <unk> her a <unk> and she looks around
<unk> of clothes are everywhere <unk> out of <unk> boxes
she <unk> a purple <unk> <unk> and <unk> a bright <unk> scarf around her neck and chest
her face is covered with dirt but she looks fine she thinks
then she <unk> to emerge from the earth
lt. col. sharif ahmed is the <unk> officer of the combined military hospital in <unk> where reshma is recovering
he <unk> at how rapid her <unk> has been
reshma whose age is listed in hospital papers as twenty two is gaining strength every day
when she came here she'd <unk> to the touch he said
she'd have <unk> if she tried to sleep
all normal considering what she went through
now she's smiling sitting up
and she's <unk> from her mother
the two hadn't always gotten along
my heart is <unk> with joy <unk> said
i begged god and he returned her
<unk> rana is in jail <unk> by police as he tried to flee to india
the owners of the factories in rana plaza are also in detention
on tuesday after twenty one days the rescue and recovery efforts <unk> ended
the disaster has spurred the government and foreign <unk> to take a long hard critical look at factory safety standards and their roles in policing it
as for reshma she doesn't know what her future holds
but she knows she's not going back to the garment business
she ended our interview with a simple request
everybody please pray for me
with the joy she brought to a nation in mourning many already are

al shabaab militants raided a quarry in kenya <unk> non muslim workers from their muslim counterparts and executing them a spokesman for the group said tuesday
at least thirty six bodies were found tuesday dumped in the quarry in the village of <unk> near the somali border the kenyan red cross said
al shabaab said the attack was retaliation for mosque raids that kenyan security forces carried out last month to <unk> out extremists
<unk> is about fifteen kilometers from the border city of <unk> in an area where the somalia based al shabaab militants are known to operate

this unfortunate and ugly incident should not be used to <unk> peace loving <unk> who have lived <unk> for centuries along religious or ethnic lines the mosque said in a statement but rather it should be taken to reflect on improving the security situation of the country

but the plan had room to improve and in a sense it failed
before dawn monday at least forty arrests had been made in <unk> according to the hong kong police
a further twelve people were also arrested in <unk> <unk>
the central government office was closed on monday morning but later re opened
the government said it condemned violent radicals saying they had provoked and <unk> abused police officers and encouraged others to charge police lines
protesters
we do not have any plan
wong was briefly arrested last week as police <unk> cleared hong kong's second largest protest site in the working class neighborhood of <unk> <unk>
now as the main protest site comes under threat protesters have been at a loss for how to best respond
arguments broke out monday between student leaders and demonstrators after police made an <unk> into the tent city
<unk> <unk> a <unk> told cnn we do not have any plan
<unk> demonstrators have argued the movement should escalate its physical <unk> with the government
but the <unk> of the occupy movement among them <unk> tai and professor chan <unk> man have repeatedly called on students to withdraw and think of a new strategy citing opinion polls that show low support for the street occupations
in a poll in november just thirteen percents of hong <unk> surveyed said the occupations should continue
<unk> messi and <unk> ronaldo find themselves fighting it out for fifa's <unk> <unk> award once again but the contest between the world's two highest profile <unk> isn't only being played out on the pitch
<unk> <unk> german international <unk> manuel <unk> was the other player on the three man <unk> revealed monday with ronaldo the overwhelming favorite to take the award
which means there is no sign of <unk> messi and real madrid poster boy <unk> <unk> of the back pages ending any time soon
both are so globally known that that their every facebook posting is worth thousands of dollars for brands associated with the two players while the <unk> of their names helps shift any and every product with which they are associated
but who is the most <unk>
is it messi the newly <unk> all time la liga top <unk>
or is it ronaldo the current <unk> <unk> holder and a man seemingly able to score goals at will no matter what the competition
sports <unk> research company <unk> examined fifteen different markets ranging from spain to the u.s. and found that <unk> <unk> ronaldo is the better known of the two
ninety two percents know of him while eighty seven percents have heard of messi
the figures also show that the same number of men know about messi as women know about ronaldo ninety one percents
they reveal that ronaldo sells more effectively with eighty six percents of those questioned regarding the ex manchester united man as an influential brand spokesman
<unk> ronaldo <unk> in terms of his overall <unk> largely because of the consistently high levels of awareness people have of him around the world whilst messi has a greater <unk> of people that do know of him saying they like him said <unk> global head of research mike <unk>
that <unk> says makes the real star the most <unk> <unk> in the world
one leading academic believes <unk> increasingly growing brand off the pitch is testament to the way his management team have <unk> him as a formal business <unk> in contrast to messi
there is a clear and deliberate strategic intent on the part of the ronaldo and his business representatives <unk> <unk> professor of sport business strategy and <unk> at <unk> <unk> university told cnn
the intention has been to create and position a brand that provides consumers with a <unk> advantage over its rivals
we've seen the development of the <unk> seven brand which ronaldo has used as the basis for the development of his commercial activities
<unk> messi was always viewed by many as the ultimate team player there has also been a shift in the way ronaldo is now presented to his audience says <unk>
from a man who has historically been perceived as being self <unk> and <unk> recently <unk> image has <unk> as the result of him paying for the medical treatment of a sick fan a young child
remember too that ronaldo had his hair cut in a particular way to mark his relationship with the boy
those actions have helped in <unk> and <unk> the latest <unk> of the ronaldo brand
the data also shows that <unk> online <unk> is higher than <unk>
the real forward boasts more than one hundred and two million facebook followers with <unk> <unk> his average facebook post value in two thousand and fourteen to be worth one hundred and forty three thousand seven hundred and fifty dollar
messi on the other hand has seventy five million facebook fans and average post value of sixty two thousand five hundred dollar
are we likely to see messi being <unk> in a different way in the coming years
i'm not convinced that messi or his <unk> want this said <unk>
i think he's simply happy to play football and pick up some additional commercial income along the way
the academic argues there are <unk> in trying to come up with a <unk> brand <unk> for the argentine star
five years years ago his brand was something <unk> to <unk> innocence someone who plays football for the joy of it
but now he has a child he is therefore not a child any more
and his tax case means that the brand may be perceived as not being innocent any more
one way for him to position the messi brand might be as a family man
but given that he is not married this may not play out well among some market <unk>
meanwhile back in the <unk> arena the statistics are more <unk> for messi even more so given he is two years younger than the twenty nine year old ronaldo
the camp <unk> <unk> is la <unk> goals record holder with two hundred and fifty three strikes to his name while ronaldo has one hundred and ninety seven
he is also the leading <unk> in the <unk> league with seventy four goals a record held jointly with raul and only one ahead of <unk> <unk> of seventy one
and messi also has the greatest number of <unk> <unk> awards four with his real madrid rival having taken the <unk> twice
ronaldo is <unk> leading all time <unk> with fifty two while messi and gabriel <unk> share the record of most goals scored in a year for argentina each striking twelve times
messi has hit forty four goals in ninety five games for his country overall
so these stars will fight it out for the <unk> <unk> award unless manuel <unk> <unk> the party

even in street landscapes i like pictures where the building is looking back at you admits the spanish photographer
it was this <unk> that inspired him to photograph the women of <unk> island off the coast of <unk>
the powerful eyes of those girls
they are very dark and very deep
that's what attracted me to them he recalls
the women and the landscape reminded him of a powerful <unk> who defined much of his childhood
spanish <unk> <unk> romero de <unk>
la <unk> <unk> is most famous painting and one of the most famous paintings in the spanish tradition he says
in the history of art when women are portrayed most of the time they're being looked at
i like portraits of women that look back at you and the woman in la <unk> <unk> is looking back with a lot of dignity and a lot of strength
another defining feature of de <unk> paintings says <unk> is the <unk> housed in their <unk>
he found a similar sentiment in the <unk> architecture
you can see that same <unk> in the <unk> buildings on the island he says
though the influence is spanish the <unk> the <unk> the models and the setting are all local to <unk>
rather than <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> by the women in de <unk> portraits <unk> picked <unk> from the <unk> markets and had dresses made by <unk> on the island
in <unk> they have an amazing tradition of <unk> and they work really fast
in one day they can create these beautiful dresses which you can see in the pictures he says
<unk> subjects also hold objects that reflect their culture
in de <unk> painting the fortune telling for instance one woman uses playing cards to give a <unk> reading to her friend
in <unk> version his models use <unk> shells a traditional <unk> fortune telling tool
i wanted to show that some emotions are universal and create a more universal portrait but i also wanted to create a more <unk> scene he says
flying above kruger national park <unk> peter <unk> steps out onto the <unk> <unk> and aims his rifle
below him a white rhino <unk> across the south african bush
as the helicopter <unk> in low <unk> the animal closer to the road <unk> looks through the <unk> and fires a single shot

then after another <unk> to partially <unk> the effects of the <unk> the rhino is pulled to its feet and led into a <unk> for the journey to safer ground away from this poaching <unk> along the mozambique border to a recently established intensive protection zone deeper into the park
the <unk> members are no ordinary <unk> but daily captures like this one are quickly becoming the <unk> for a team tasked with the care of <unk> most threatened species
they've already conducted more than thirty <unk> since last month and will conduct hundreds more
they are a key part of a protection plan which has taken on even greater urgency since the country's environmental minister announced that a record one thousand and twenty of south africa's rhinos have been <unk> this year
the illegal trade in rhino horn is fueled by an <unk> demand in asia where it is prized as a sign of wealth and believed to have <unk> value though there's no scientific evidence to support claims that it has healing properties
rhino horn is made of <unk> the same <unk> found in human <unk> but it can still fetch as much as five thousand five hundred and fifty dollar an <unk> on the black market that's more than the price of gold more than the price of <unk> and roughly equivalent to the price of <unk>
kruger national park which is home to roughly ten thousand rhinos a quarter of the world's population shares a three hundred and fifty kilometer border with impoverished mozambique making it a massive target for poachers
we were rangers now we're at war the park's head of anti poaching major general <unk> <unk> told cnn
but while new equipment and new technology has helped lead to a record number of poaching arrests this year it has done little to slow the slaughter
the general says his enemy has a nearly <unk> supply of foot soldiers ready to cross the border and risk it all for small <unk> of the profit
last month alone six hundred poachers <unk> the park from mozambique
once a <unk> is in the park it's like a <unk> in your home said <unk> who admitted that in a park the size of israel military style <unk> alone will never be enough to save <unk> rhinos and that much more needs to be done outside the park's boundaries
the intensive protection zones will at least give his rangers the chance to establish what the general calls <unk> within a <unk>
we made the decision that we are here for the living rhino not the dead <unk> explained
there was a time when this park famous and now targeted for its prized rhinos had none
several <unk> including one from one thousand nine hundred and sixty to one thousand nine hundred and seventy two that introduced three hundred rhinos helped grow <unk> population which reached its peak of twelve thousand two hundred rhinos in two thousand and ten
this is exactly what we've been doing for the last thirty years said <unk> <unk> head of <unk> services at kruger about this latest round of <unk>

the ritual sacrifice of <unk> <unk> and <unk> in <unk> and at home is widespread in nepal where eighty <unk> of the population are hindu
some five million people from <unk> districts and also from the <unk> indian states of <unk> and uttar pradesh will attend the festival according to local authorities although only two days are dedicated to the <unk> ritual itself

some take up to forty minutes to die
the participants who hack the animals in an <unk> arena with large <unk> are <unk> by the gadhimai festival management and development committee
this year about four hundred people will kill animals according to <unk> who is also the committee's secretary
the animals not only suffer while they are being killed
they are also transported over long <unk> on foot
by the time they get to the festival venue they are half dead says shah
they are kept two or three days without food after they are brought here
activists have gone to the courts in nepal and india to halt the sacrifices
last month <unk> supreme court did not stop the animal sacrifices but ruled that existing laws have to be followed
if the existing laws are implemented there would be no ritual sacrifices says <unk> <unk> the lawyer who filed the case explaining that only animals killed in a <unk> are fit to be <unk>
courts in india also directed the indian government not to control the <unk> export of animals to nepal
the indian authorities for their part had directed security agencies and state governments to check the flow of <unk> to the neighboring country

all living creatures are equal in the eyes of god he says
instead of animals we can offer <unk> <unk> <unk> and sweets to the <unk>
the festival management committee can not stop the animal sacrifices but if the government asks the committee can discuss the issue says <unk>
shah and other activists had been working with the government since the last festival in two thousand and nine to stop the sacrifices but although there was some progress a government decision was not reached
