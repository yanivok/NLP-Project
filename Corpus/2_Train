the video sixty seven seconds long was released saturday as others before it by isis media wing al <unk> media and can not be <unk> by cnn
we are deeply <unk> by this <unk> and <unk> act of terrorism and we denounce it in the strongest terms japanese prime minister shinzo abe said in tokyo according to broadcaster nhk
to the terrorists we will never never forgive them for this act
he said that japan will continue to provide humanitarian aid to countries affected by the bloody fight against isis
goto's mother junko ishido said he wanted to help create a world without wars
i'm <unk> tears of sorrow i just can't think of any words to say
but i don't want this sorrow to create a chain of hatred she said nhk reported
the video opens with a black <unk> that reads a message to japan
the video then shows a kneeling goto wearing an orange <unk>
the man known as jihadi john is standing behind him
the terrorist speaks while holding a knife in his left hand
abe because of your <unk> decision to take part in an <unk> war this knife will not only slaughter kenji but will also carry on and cause carnage wherever your people are found
so let the nightmare for japan begin the man says
the video cuts to black as the militant puts the knife to goto's throat
it then shows the apparent result of the <unk>
it's not clear who conducted the apparent killing
the knife wielding masked man with a london <unk> <unk> jihadi john has issued threats and <unk> the beheadings of other captives
he has appeared in at least six videos with hostages
the fate of a jordanian pilot captured by isis in syria moath al kasasbeh was unclear
he is not mentioned in the video
isis had been demanding that jordan exchange a convicted terrorist sajida al rishawi for the pilot
if there was no swap isis said it would kill al <unk> first then goto
goto would be the second japanese hostage to be killed by isis recently
a video file posted online a week ago by a known isis supporter shows an image of goto holding a photo of what appeared to be the corpse of his fellow captive haruna yukawa
we stand today in solidarity with prime minister abe and the japanese people in <unk> this barbaric act the president said in a written statement
we <unk> japan's <unk> commitment to advancing peace and prosperity in the middle east and globally including its generous assistance for innocent people affected by the conflicts in the region
the forty seven year old goto left japan last fall when his youngest daughter was three weeks old
his wife <unk> first heard from his captors december two
jordanian officials have said they are willing to swap al rishawi a female jihadist imprisoned in jordan for her role in a two thousand and five suicide bombing at a wedding reception that killed dozens for the pilot
but jordan's key condition is proof that al <unk> is still alive
al <unk> was captured after he ejected from his f sixteen jet last month near raqqa the extremist group's de facto capital in syria
<unk> al <unk> an uncle of the pilot told cnn
i am sad and devastated to hear this news regardless of the <unk> of the person
i am sad about this act of the beheading of any human
also i am very worried about the well being of the son of my brother my nephew
a photo of the miami herald correspondent smiling and embracing a woman was featured thursday as part of venezuelan state run <unk> online tourism campaign

an <unk> <unk> except for the fact that the photo was taken on <unk> return to the united states after being detained for forty eight hours by venezuelan authorities two years ago
the image was snapped at miami international airport not at <unk> <unk> international airport outside the venezuelan capital by miami herald <unk> <unk> <unk> in november two thousand and thirteen the newspaper said
<unk> <unk> smile came when he finally arrived on american soil after his detention while reporting about <unk> in the border town of san <unk> in the state of <unk>
venezuelan authorities at the time said he was detained for failing to have the proper media <unk> the miami herald reported friday
but <unk> officials apparently believed it was a <unk> image to promote tourism in a south american nation where chronic shortages of basic goods had led to protests
the hashtag of the twitter campaign was <unk> or we love <unk>
on twitter on thursday <unk> seemed somewhat <unk>
<unk>

numerous attempts to reach <unk> for comment were unsuccessful
the photos of <unk> have been taken down
on monday kurdish fighters declared that they had released the city on the border to turkey from isis grip after one hundred and twelve days of fighting
the efforts of the kurdish fighters known as the ypg or people's protection units on the ground were backed by an extensive campaign of airstrikes by the u.s. led international coalition against isis
and according to the interviews given to isis <unk> <unk> news agency in syria it was those airstrikes that won the battle for kobani referred to by the fighters as <unk> al islam
recently we have <unk> from <unk> al islam bit by bit because of the airstrikes and deaths of a number of our brothers said one of the two fighters his face covered apart from his eyes
he points to a scene of destruction behind him but <unk> that isis will <unk> and this is the message we send to obama
the second fighter interviewed by <unk> stood near a road sign reading <unk> al islam
he said isis forces had raided three hundred and sixty villages around kobani from which the people ran away like <unk>
but the reason behind their withdrawal from the city he said is that we no longer had places to hold there
we were inside <unk> al islam and we occupied more than seventy percents but the airstrikes did not leave any building standing they destroyed everything
his horror of the airstrikes was apparent
i <unk> by god their planes did not leave the air day and night
they did airstrikes all day and night
they targeted everything
they even attacked <unk>
they have not left a building standing
but by god willing we will return and we will have our revenge <unk>
isis is on its heels after the loss of kobani and an offensive by kurdish peshmerga armed fighters who protect iraq's kurdish region around mosul iraq's second largest city and a <unk> point for all sides in the conflict
but on friday the sunni extremist group launched an assault on iraq's oil rich city of kirkuk in what may be an attempt to <unk> kurdish troops from mosul
a report by <unk> a private website dedicated to <unk> news from a kurdish perspective said at least thirty isis fighters were killed in the assault and fifteen captured
casualties on the other side included brig
gen. <unk> <unk> the highest ranking operational commander of the peshmerga <unk> located in kirkuk
isis captured fifteen employees working at the <unk> <unk> southwest of kirkuk after launching their assault in the area brig
gen. <unk> <unk> the head of <unk> suburbs and villages police told cnn on saturday
a joint operation is underway by his police officers peshmerga and kurdish security forces to free the hostages and take back control of the <unk> seized by isis militants on friday <unk> said
troops have already liberated al <unk> village also taken by isis on friday and located next to <unk> oil field he said
meanwhile gen. hussein mansour the head of peshmerga forces in <unk> in diyala province was killed in clashes with isis in southwestern kirkuk <unk> <unk> a senior kurdish figure and local peshmerga leader told cnn on saturday
mansour brought his troops from <unk> about one hundred miles away to <unk> the peshmerga in kirkuk following the isis assault he said
u.s. and coalition aircraft carried out seventeen airstrikes in iraq on friday according to a u.s. central command statement ten of them near kirkuk and two near mosul
both the coalition and the peshmerga are trying to prevent isis from opening a new front in kirkuk which isis likely hoped would <unk> the pressure on mosul
additionally by going on the offensive here isis appears to be offering some obvious targets for strikes
if isis can be driven back from positions in kirkuk it will have to try other tactical <unk> to draw kurdish forces away from the outskirts of mosul
the kurds on their own admission have no intention of entering mosul but want to <unk> off isis supply lines into the city
another ten airstrikes were carried out friday against isis targets in syria eight of them near kobani
according to the syrian observatory for human rights a london based opposition group from october six to monday the fighting for kobani killed nine hundred and seventy nine isis combatants three hundred and twenty four ypg fighters and twelve rebels backing the ypg
thirty eight more isis militants died in attacks using <unk> trapped vehicles or bomb <unk> and the isis shelling of kobani killed twelve civilians <unk> said
on the other hand hundreds of militants died during u.s. and arab allies airstrikes on the city and its countryside the group said
however the success of the coalition airstrikes in kobani will be hard to <unk> elsewhere
there are almost no civilians left in the city of kobani and most residents left early on when the fighting started especially in the <unk> areas close to the front line
this meant airstrikes were <unk> <unk> with the coalition able to target one side and avoid civilian casualties
the front line was well defined so it was clear where the isis and kurdish fighters were
a more challenging situation is when airstrikes seek to target isis inside populated areas like mosul in iraq raqqa in syria and other cities under isis control
here the <unk> of airstrikes is limited because of the risk of casualties among civilians
when coalition airstrikes hit cities in aleppo in northern syria civilian deaths were reported last year
but in the isolated town of sandino cuba's first catholic church since the one thousand nine hundred and fifty nine revolution took power is set to be built
there is money to start there is the construction material to start there are the <unk> to start so everything is ready said bishop <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> who <unk> the diocese where the new church will be built
the sandino church has been fifty six years in the making ever since fidel castro took power and cuba became an officially <unk> state
religious people fell under suspicion by the new revolutionary government but none more so than those who belonged to the catholic church which was seen as being <unk> sympathetic to the <unk> regime that castro had driven from power
in the first years of the revolution thousands of catholic <unk> were jailed or forced into exile and church property including the <unk> school that castro attended was seized by the cuban government
only with the visit in one thousand nine hundred and ninety eight of pope john paul ii to the island did relations between the cuban government and catholic church begin to <unk>
christmas again became a national holiday and cubans faced less official discrimination for practicing their faiths
in december cuban president raul castro thanked pope francis for his role in the secret talks that led to a prisoner swap between cuba and the united states and the start of negotiations to restore full diplomatic relations
in two thousand and fifteen church officials said requests to build new churches that had long been <unk> in red tape began to receive government approval
while church officials said several new catholic houses of worship are in the works the first will be built in sandino a remote town at the end of a <unk> <unk> road in cuba's <unk> province
the rev
<unk> castro drives that road to sandino once a week to <unk> mass in a converted garage in the back of a house the church <unk>
he has lost count of the miles he has put on his green russian <unk> as part of his ministry to towns throughout the province
when the new catholic church is built the first in <unk> history castro said he would move to <unk> there full time
i hope the church doesn't stay within the four walls he said that it will go farther than that
that with the building of the new church there will be more people of faith castro said
the cuban catholic church desperately needs more followers in cuba where in recent years the <unk> religion <unk> that <unk> african religions with <unk> has exploded in popularity
the church in sandino will take about two years to build and when completed will hold two hundred people castro said
most of the fifty thousand dollar collected so far for the new church comes from fund <unk> held by the st. <unk> catholic church in <unk> florida
much of <unk> history and culture comes from cuba said the rev
tom <unk> st. <unk> <unk>
it's absolutely fantastic they are building a new church and i hope to be able to visit one day
<unk> said he was optimistic that recent changes in u.s <unk> department regulations would make it possible for his church to send supplies and building materials to cuba to help with the construction of the new church
as she makes her way down a path to attend mass in <unk> <unk> converted garage <unk> martinez said she has waited more than five decades for a church to be built in sandino
martinez said she her husband and two children were those <unk> to the town during early one thousand nine hundred and sixty s when a <unk> fidel castro was still battling what he called <unk> <unk> against his revolution waging <unk> warfare in the countryside
while there is no official <unk> hundreds perhaps thousands of people suspected of plotting against the revolution were <unk> to sandino to live in a form of internal exile
it was a process to make a community for political prisoners martinez said
they took our farm away and brought us here
a <unk> catholic martinez said one of the most devastating things about being forced to move five hundred miles away from her home to a town she had never heard of was that there was no church
having a church is very important she said
many of the people here were brought up catholic and need a church
we were <unk> and prayed when we went to bed and <unk> up just like our parents and grandparents taught us
the long <unk> was found in two thousand and six by farmers <unk> for a fish <unk> in <unk> city in the southwestern <unk> province
<unk> <unk> a member of the research team from the university of <unk> who made the discovery told cnn it was named <unk> the <unk> of <unk> because farmers thought the bones <unk> the shape of chinese <unk> <unk>
we found the <unk> huge <unk> with the skull and the tail but couldn't find any bones from the hands or the legs
so the locals began to say the long body looked just like a <unk> from ancient chinese stories said <unk>
the findings published earlier this week in the journal of <unk> <unk> show that the new species <unk> to a group of <unk> called <unk> known for their extremely long necks which would measure up to half their body length
most <unk> or long <unk> <unk> such as those <unk> in the popular <unk> series the land before time have necks that span only one third of their body length
<unk> is a cool animal
if you imagine a big animal that is half neck you can see that evolution can do quite extraordinary things <unk> <unk> a <unk> student at the university of <unk> said in a press release
the <unk> is the youngest addition to the <unk> group which is only found in asia
the discovery suggests that there may be other species of long necks within the <unk> from different <unk>
<unk> shows that long <unk> <unk> <unk> in unique ways in asia during <unk> times something very special was going on in that continent said <unk>
nowhere else we can find <unk> with longer necks than those in china
the new <unk> tells us that these extreme species <unk> in isolation from the rest of the world
the <unk> is now housed in a museum in <unk> but will be moved to a new <unk> museum in the city that is currently being built
how much do you really know about <unk>
three of the prisoners isis apparently wants back are women a failed suicide bomber an alleged bomb maker and a woman tied to the head of isis
the fourth is a child
many countries have a strategy of not negotiating with terrorists
but this new approach by isis is putting governments to the test
in its most recent demand isis called for sajida al rishawi to be handed over
she is a female jihadi imprisoned for her role in a two thousand and five suicide bombing at a wedding reception in jordan that killed dozens
if she wasn't brought to the turkish border by sunset thursday the militants said two hostages would die
japanese journalist kenji goto and jordanian pilot moaz al kassasbeh
the deadline has passed but the hostages fate is unknown
by negotiating with isis by recognizing them by even having dialogue with them it gives them the <unk> of acting as a state said <unk> gohel international security director at the asia pacific foundation
jordanian officials have said they are willing to swap al rishawi for the pilot
but they have demanded proof of life to demonstrate that al kassasbeh captured in december after his fighter jet crashed in syria is still alive
former fbi negotiator chris <unk> said jordan was absolutely right to do so and that the failure of isis so far to provide proof of life was suspicious
it's just a natural and ordinary course of <unk> in these types of negotiations and they are choosing not to do that at this point he said
the latest proposal by isis is not a prisoner exchange in the usual sense since the militants now want the release of al rishawi just in order not to kill the two hostages rather than promising their release
<unk> said entering into this kind of territory with terrorists was dangerous
if you engage in that sort of bargain then they can <unk> to kill the same person over and over and over again and continue to demand release of hostages or whatever their demands are he said
you can't give in to that sort of thing because then it puts you in an endless loop where they have all the power
it's important to remember that for isis and groups like them the key factor is gain <unk> said
kidnappers are in a <unk> exchange business
while it's a horrifying concept to us to them it's business and it's the business isis is in and so you have to treat it like that
besides failed suicide bomber al rishawi isis wants two other women an alleged bomb maker and a woman tied to the head of isis and a child
each of the prisoners is <unk> and <unk> important for the terror group
al rishawi is connected to isis through her brother once a ranking member of al qaeda in iraq which <unk> isis
in exchange for american journalists james foley and later steven sotloff isis demanded the release of <unk> <unk> <unk> lady al qaeda an imprisoned <unk> in the united states linked to nine eleven mastermind <unk> sheikh mohammed
she was arrested in afghanistan in two thousand and eight carrying bomb making documents for a mass casualty chemical and biological weapons attack against american targets including the statue of liberty and the brooklyn bridge
one high profile prisoner who isis has not yet publicly demanded is <unk> al dulaimi
she may be the wife of <unk> isis leader abu bakr al baghdadi who fought with al qaeda in iraq though the iraqi interior ministry has disputed that
regional sources have told cnn that al dulaimi is herself a powerful isis figure arrested as a high value target as she crossed into lebanon with a four year old child whom one intelligence source identified as baghdadi's son
since their capture in march two thousand and fourteen baghdadi has been calling to get his child released a regional source said
in the past in similar cases governments have <unk>
last year the united states traded several taliban captives for sergeant <unk> <unk> who was captured by the extremist group almost five years earlier
despite claims that <unk> may have abandoned his post before being kidnapped the state department defended the move saying it was nothing unusual
it is consistent absolutely with what's happened in previous wars including korea including vietnam said state department spokeswoman marie <unk> adding that there was a long history in the united states of prisoner <unk>
<unk> the debate one of the five taliban detainees released from guantanamo bay in return for <unk> last may has attempted to return to militant activity from his current location in qatar by making contact with suspected taliban associates in afghanistan multiple officials told cnn on thursday
during the cold war the west also <unk> hundreds of spies with communist <unk> countries
in two thousand and eleven israel made a major made a major <unk> to its <unk> enemy the palestinian militant group hamas which runs gaza
it exchanged more than one thousand palestinian prisoners in return for the soldier <unk> <unk> who had been kidnapped in gaza in two thousand and six
hamas celebrated the deal as a major victory and the government of prime minister benjamin netanyahu was heavily criticized
<unk> <unk> a uk based risk <unk> says <unk> prisoners for hostages is still better than paying for release of prisoners as some european countries do
the payment of cash ransom can been seen as the direct funding of terrorist organizations and for that reason and a few others is regarded as unacceptable certainly by the u.s. uk and increasingly other nations he said
there would be nothing unusual about the <unk> of combatants and if the japanese victim is thrown in as part of the deal then that is a great <unk>
it's sadly far from certain that goto and al kassasbeh will emerge from the current negotiations alive
but whether they gain the release of al rishawi or not isis leaders have very clearly achieved one goal
maximum media coverage for their cause
for months isis has been facing off with the peshmerga armed fighters who protect iraqi kurdistan to the west of kirkuk
it had gone into areas on <unk> outskirts but not the central city
heavily armed militants attacked an abandoned hotel in central kirkuk that local police had used as their headquarters
peshmerga and kurdish anti terror units later raided the hotel <unk> control of it from the militants and killing three of them according to peshmerga sources
in addition two suicide bombers detonated themselves in an attempt to keep the kurdish forces out
also friday isis militants took over <unk> <unk> an area about twelve miles southwest of kirkuk after heavy clashes with the peshmerga
among those killed was brig
gen. <unk> <unk> the highest ranking operational commander of the peshmerga <unk> located in kirkuk
photos posted by isis purportedly show the group's militants in control of parts of south and southwest kirkuk burning tents that had been used by peshmerga troops
the u.s. military said friday that an isis chemical weapons expert was killed during a coalition strike late last week
abu malik worked in <unk> <unk> chemical weapons program before joining al qaeda in two thousand and five u.s. central command said
he was killed january twenty four near mosul
his death is expected to temporarily <unk> and <unk> the terrorist network and <unk> ability to potentially produce and use chemical weapons against innocent people the military said
there is no public evidence that isis has a dedicated weapons of mass destruction program
but u.s. central command said
his past training and experience provided the terrorist group with expertise to pursue a chemical weapons capability
kirkuk is a <unk> important city in the months long fight one that has <unk> isis against the peshmerga iraqi government troops and an international coalition that has carried out airstrikes against the terrorist group
it is one of the few notable cities apart from the region of kurdistan and its capital <unk> in northern iraq that haven't fallen to isis
part of its significance <unk> from the fact its oil reserves are almost as much as those in southern iraq
the kurds and the central iraqi government in baghdad have long <unk> over control of those reserves with each side wanting to keep hold of them
isis which <unk> heavily on revenue from oil smuggling to fund its operations has been <unk> them too
peshmerga forces took over the kirkuk area in june when the iraqi army <unk> in the face of isis advances and have played a vital role in defending it from isis since
in december isis claimed responsibility for a suicide car bomb attack there that killed at least seventeen people and injured more than twenty
the attack according to isis was meant to send a message to the kurdish people and peshmerga fighters
still kirkuk is hardly the only place that has seen recent fighting which may be part of isis rationale for friday's attack there
the group has been <unk> off an offensive from peshmerga fighters around mosul iraq's second largest city and a <unk> point for all sides in the conflict that has left the sunni extremist group on its heels
the city of one point five million people on the <unk> river has been held by isis since june
isis has invested heavily in governing the city
its leader abu bakr al baghdadi pronounced his leadership of the caliphate at the grand mosque there in july
kurdish officials say that as long as isis holds mosul it threatens kurdistan
likewise neither the government in baghdad nor its coalition partners can rest while terrorists occupy iraq's second largest city
peshmerga forces have made steady progress against isis north and west of mosul over the past two months
they have taken some three thousand square kilometers of the sinjar area as well as the area around the mosul dam <unk> off access routes and threatening isis main <unk> routes
there's little doubt though that isis remains a very real force and threat in much of iraq
the group which calls itself the islamic state still controls a vast <unk> of that middle eastern nation and neighboring syria
its goal is to have a vast caliphate under its strict version of sharia law with its followers <unk> they will stop at nothing having been blamed for the large scale killings of civilians mass kidnappings and forcing women and girls to become sex slaves during its quest
that violent campaign continued friday and not just in kirkuk
dozens of gunmen believed to be from isis faced off friday morning about one hundred and seventy five miles away in central <unk> police and health officials in that city said
several hours later that onslaught had been foiled and twenty gunmen were dead according to the officials
elsewhere in <unk> a suicide car bomb explosion at an iraqi army checkpoint killed one soldier and wounded six others
violence <unk> in other parts of iraq as well that while it hasn't been tied to isis is further proof of the country's <unk> state
six explosions went off friday around baghdad leaving at least seven dead and twenty three wounded according to police officials
the deadliest such blast was in <unk> al <unk> a busy commercial area in central baghdad leaving three dead and ten hurt
now would you two care for a date
that was possible some fifty five thousand years ago in modern day israel <unk> announced this week a find that they say could be significant since it could shed light on when and how our modern day ancestors moved from africa into europe and asia
it's all based on the discovery of <unk> of a skull in <unk> cave in western <unk> detailed in a study published wednesday in nature
the <unk> is unequivocally modern and is similar in shape to recent african <unk> as well as to european <unk> according to the report from a team of researchers from the university of tel aviv ben <unk> university israel <unk> authority and elsewhere
it's amazing co author israel <unk> told the guardian explaining how the skull was found on the <unk> <unk> of a cave that collapsed thirty thousand years ago and was revealed in two thousand and eight
this is the first <unk> we have that <unk> africa to europe
why is that time frame significant
for one thing many scientists believe modern humans left africa for points north forty thousand to sixty thousand years ago
the nature study suggests it was closer to the older date and that they might have gone through the modern day middle east
according to the report an analysis of the skull indicates that the <unk> people could be closely related to the first modern humans who later successfully <unk> europe
in other words the first modern day europeans thought to have arrived on that continent around forty five thousand years ago may have stopped in israel first
but it's not like they were all alone then among <unk> the blanket term for <unk> <unk> from chimpanzees to <unk> <unk> in either place
around that time what's known as the upper <unk> period or late stone age there were neanderthals both in europe and in what's now israel
the nature study claims the <unk> find represents the only modern human <unk> to provide evidence that during the middle and upper <unk> <unk> both modern humans and neanderthals <unk> <unk> the southern <unk>
this all was happening around the time of likely <unk>
with the neanderthals meaning the two groups of <unk> could have gotten together and <unk>
without dna tests it's impossible to say if the adult whose skull was found was a pure <unk> of the modern humans who came from africa or had a bit of <unk> <unk> mixed in
but it definitely could have happened
or just as possible that person or some immediate ancestors could have <unk> with neanderthals
<unk> is the best candidate for the <unk> of modern humans with neanderthals <unk> told the guardian
there really is no other candidate
the discovery was generally greeted <unk> by experts though with some <unk> of <unk>
this was only one <unk> after all so there may be others out there that could be even more <unk>
and it was only part of a skull
chris <unk> of london's natural history museum tweeted that he agrees with <unk> that <unk> could have happened elsewhere in asia
also skull <unk> the most <unk> areas
yet in comments to discovery news <unk> also acknowledged that <unk> might represent some of the elusive first migrants in the <unk> out of africa event about sixty thousand years ago a population whose <unk> ultimately spread right across asia and also into europe
<unk> said it is the first modern human from western asia that is well dated to the estimated time frame of <unk> between early modern humans and neanderthals

eventually they took the party to the auschwitz police station he said where they were kept until five thirty a.m. and questioned one by one
they don't know how to <unk> between the real criminals and those who were there simply to do an interview and honor the day of memory he said
the incident ended with the party writing down their version of events <unk> said adding that they had asked for the matter to be looked into through italian diplomatic channels
a spokesman for the auschwitz museum gave cnn a different account of the <unk> events however
<unk> <unk> said the italian tv crew had permission to film at the site until eleven point three zero p.m. when they had agreed that they would exit and security guards would come to the gate to let them out
he said <unk> footage shows they finished early and went to the gate a few minutes past eleven p.m. rather than waiting for the security guards to come at the agreed time one of them broke into the <unk> center and let others in too he said
this triggered an alarm so the security guards came to the building which houses cash <unk> and an <unk>
according to protocol they asked the men to show <unk> but they refused to do so <unk> said
the police had to be called since they can only demand that people show <unk> documents he said
the police then arrived and took over the matter he said
while being on the site we have to follow the rules <unk> said
so until the unfortunate incident everything was ok because they had our permission they <unk> with our security and they had the time that they declared they would be leaving
he said the group could also have gone to another exit one hundred and fifty meters away where the security guards were based if they wanted to leave earlier and could then have been let out of that gate
however they decided to act outside the regulations and triggered the security alarm and triggered the whole reaction and then refused to cooperate
auschwitz is a <unk> heritage place he said
it must be protected and there must be security
sure south africa and tanzania have great safaris
of course the <unk> is africa's most famous desert
and yes kenya has rich traditions of indigenous cultures
but for all three in a quiet country still <unk> by crowds nowhere comes close to namibia

yet in his mind he had to go into war torn syria
the experienced journalist explained why in a video shot in october from southern turkey
he felt <unk> to tell the stories of war in all its trauma complexity and humanity
syrian people suffering for three years and a half
it's enough the forty seven year old goto explained
so i would like to get the story of what isis wants to do
so goto crossed the border into syria and headed toward the islamist extremist group's de facto capital of <unk> despite the advice of friend <unk> al zaim who'd been with him previously in that nation
al zaim recalled telling goto it's not safe for you
the journalist replied that he didn't feel he was in danger
after all his native japan unlike the iraqi government and the international coalition supporting it wasn't involved in the military fight against the terrorist group that's branded itself as the islamic state
i am not american
i am not british
i am japanese goto said according to al zaim i can go
it appears to have been a mistake
a new isis video released saturday appeared to show the <unk> body of goto
while the authenticity of the video could not immediately be established by cnn japanese officials did not challenge news of his apparent death
we are deeply <unk> by this <unk> and <unk> act of terrorism and we denounce it in the strongest terms prime minister shinzo abe said in tokyo
goto covered big news stories for years hoping that by telling them he could make a difference in the world
his work was featured by numerous japanese organizations including broadcaster nhk
and he wasn't afraid to put himself in <unk> way to tell a story
one need just look to his previous trip to syria where a bloody complicated civil war has gone on for four years
the united nations estimated in august that nearly two hundred thousand had been killed more than three million syrians had become refugees and at least six point five million were displaced inside the country
while there goto came to know another japanese man a forty two year old aspiring security contractor haruna yukawa
according to yukawa's friend <unk> kimoto goto passed along insights on how to survive in syria and introduced him to rebel fighters who are distinct from isis though both are fighting syrian president bashar al assad's forces
the fact the two japanese men's paths had crossed again became public january twenty in an isis video posted to social media
it shows goto and yukawa dressed in orange kneeling in front of a masked black clad man
in it the isis militant gives the japanese government a choice to pay two hundred million dollar the same amount of money prime minister shinzo abe recently pledged for those <unk> with isis to free the japanese men within seventy two hours
days later a new message was posted by known isis supporters featuring the voice of someone claiming to be goto
yukawa apparently was dead
and so soon would goto the new message claimed unless jordan's government freed its longtime prisoner sajida al rishawi a convicted terrorist
on saturday the latest isis video showed the masked man blaming japan's humanitarian support of coalition efforts in iraq and syria for goto's apparent beheading
japan's government insisted it did everything within reason that it could to bring goto home safely
the fate of moath al kasasbeh a jordanian pilot recently captured by isis while on a military mission targeting the islamist extremist group is unclear
he was not shown or mentioned in the video
speaking out for the first time thursday goto's wife <unk> said her husband was taken from me october twenty five although she didn't know it until a december two message from his captors landed in her <unk>
now after working <unk> behind the scenes she went public to beg the jordanian and japanese governments to understand that the <unk> of both are in their hands
her statement comes after she got another email wednesday with the hostage takers final demand
our baby girl was only three weeks old when kenji left
i hope our oldest daughter who is just two will get to see her father again <unk> said on thursday
i want them both to grow up knowing their father
as to why goto left in the first place his wife said my husband is a good and honest man who went to syria to show the plight of those who suffer
i believe that kenji may have also been trying to find out about haruna yukawa's situation
i know all too well what are going through
the japanese <unk> mother junko ishido had spoken out previously trying to save a man she insists is not the enemy of isis
while goto's decision to go to syria surprised his mother his rationale did not
ishido said kenji always has been a kind person ever since he was little
he was always saying i want to save the lives of children in war zones
and now goto has become a victim in a war a fact that's tearing ishido apart
i'm <unk> tears of sorrow i just can't think of any words to say but i don't want this sorrow to create a chain of hatred she said saturday
kenji worked for children who suffered from conflicts and poverty and his goal was to create a society without war
i want to pass on his thoughts to people around the world
who is jordanian pilot moath al kasasbeh captured by isis
the revelations which came in the opening day of an inquest into the sixteen hour siege of a central sydney cafe are likely to further fuel questions about how new south wales police responded to the december fifteen incident especially their choice of weapons
of the five shots fired by man haron monis a self <unk> muslim cleric who took eighteen people hostage only one found a target <unk> assisting the <unk> <unk> gormly told the inquest
monis shot and killed cafe manager tori johnson execution style prompting police to storm the cafe in the early hours of december sixteen gormly said
victims of sydney siege
a mother of three and a beloved son
all the injuries that followed two fatal including those to monis and four non fatal were caused by police fire according to the evidence
the inquest is expected to examine whether the deaths of johnson the <unk> thirty four year old manager and katrina dawson a thirty eight year old lawyer could have been prevented
addressing those at the hearing which was closed to the public but open to hostages and victims families gormly outlined the events that led to the deaths of johnson dawson and the gunman
he said the first killing of johnson occurred at about two point one four a.m. shortly after a group of hostages fled the cafe
gormly described an execution style killing in which monis ordered johnson to <unk> then simply shot him without further notice or warning in the back of the head
the end of the barrel was about seventy five <unk> from mr johnson's head at the moment of <unk> he said
mr johnson is believed to have died immediately
the killing was witnessed by a police <unk> resulting in an immediate order to force entry he said
police then shot out the glass doors and windows threw in eleven <unk> producing <unk> and <unk> and two armed tactical response officers entered firing twenty two shots
at least two police bullets or bullet fragments struck monis in the head and eleven other police bullets or fragments hit his body killing him <unk> said gormly
but their rounds <unk> off the hard <unk> in the cafe killing dawson and injuring three other hostages and one of the response team who was struck in the face
<unk> dawson was struck by six fragments of a police bullet or bullets he said
gormly said the siege began after monis entered the lindt cafe at about eight point three three a.m. carrying a large <unk> and a plastic bag <unk> a <unk> off shotgun and ordered chocolate cake and tea
he moved to a table with a clear view of the cafe then after about thirty minutes asked to speak with the manager
staff noticed that johnson's body language appeared tense
he called on an employee to fetch his keys <unk> the doors and remain calm
monis then stood up produced a shotgun and announced that he had a bomb before ordering hostages to hold up an islamic flag
he then ordered johnson to make an emergency call to authorities announcing that it was a terrorist attack and that there were bombs elsewhere
police arrived at the scene shortly after
several investigations into what occurred over the two days of the siege are underway including what information security agencies had on monis and how the police handled the crisis
lawyers representing dawson johnson and the police force will appear at the inquest as well as lawyers representing two tactical response officers
johnson's family members were in <unk> as well as john <unk> one of the first hostages to escape
the unlikely find could be nearly two hundred thousand years old and suggests a fourth type of ancient human who lived in asia long before <unk> <unk> ever came to be
three other known <unk> asian <unk> include <unk> <unk> found in java and china

and neanderthals in the russian <unk> mountains
scientists believe that human <unk> and teeth became smaller as they evolved
but unlike other <unk> of the time the newly discovered <unk> is thick with large <unk> suggesting the existence of a different group
the new taiwan <unk> is clearly different than the known <unk> <unk> populations from northern china and java and likely represents a group that has been <unk> so far researcher dr. <unk> <unk> told cnn
it's only one piece but the significance is huge
researchers from taiwan and japan named the ancient human <unk> one after the <unk> channel where the fossil was found
the team spent five years analyzing the <unk> which was difficult to date because it had been recovered from the sea
the findings reminded me that our knowledge is always very limited and we have very limited fossil records said <unk>
that's a great lesson for me
study
<unk> skull in israel may shed light on humans path from africa
in another the <unk> young man in uniform appears deadly serious as one might expect from a fighter pilot whose airstrikes demand precision
behind his military <unk> was a <unk> muslim who <unk> the quran and hailed from a large family and prominent tribe noted for its <unk> to the monarchy
al <unk> fate had been a mystery since last december when his aircraft crashed during a mission and he was reportedly captured by isis in syria
that mystery ended tuesday when video and images purportedly by isis show the pilot suffered a horrible death
footage and images released by the islamist militants depict the pilot in a cage being burned alive
jordanian state tv confirmed his death but cnn could not immediately verify the authenticity of the tape
the pilot's father safi al kasasbeh described his son as an <unk> muslim
the father made those remarks well before his son's death was disclosed
at the time of the capture safi al kasasbeh told the jordan times that his son was a very modest and religious person who <unk> the muslim holy book and was never harmful to anyone
the twenty seven year old pilot was a <unk> according to the jordan times an english language newspaper published daily in the kingdom
one of eight children moath al kasasbeh came from <unk> <unk> in jordan and <unk> from king hussein air college the newspaper said
prior to the announcement of his death a message purportedly from isis had presented an ultimatum to jordan
bring convicted terrorist sajida al rishawi to the turkish border by sunset january twenty nine or the pilot will die
tied to his fate was that of japanese hostage kenji goto whose apparent beheading was shown in a video released by isis militants over the weekend
jordan had said it was ready to release al rishawi if al kasasbeh were to be released <unk>
<unk> with shock at how the pilot was murdered jordanian officials were said to be considering a military response to isis's claims
king abdullah condemned the killing and said that the brave pilot was killed in defense of his religion his country and his nation
it is the duty of the sons and daughters of jordan to stand together and show the <unk> of the jordanian people in unity determination and resolve the king said
a jordanian official said the pilot was actually killed a month ago in early january
the purported <unk> is a <unk> <unk> to al <unk> life
while he was still considered missing the family's desperation grew as time passed and as al <unk> fate was linked to that of goto and the release of al rishawi
goto appeared to hold a picture of the pilot now bearded in a video message purported to be from isis that was released in january
on the same day safi al kasasbeh joined hundreds of fellow <unk> at a solidarity protest held in the capital <unk> where he called on the jordanian authorities to act to secure his son's release
i firmly ask <unk> has sent moath to fight outside the borders of jordan on a mission unrelated to us to make strong efforts to bring back moath he said
<unk> blood is precious
it's precious and it represents the blood of all <unk> he said
the plight of moath al kasasbeh <unk> with king abdullah who has been a <unk> of the international effort against isis and is himself a former helicopter pilot
the young captive hailed from a high ranking tribe considered especially loyal to the royal family
abdullah's wife queen <unk> posted an image to her four hundred thousand instagram followers shortly after meeting with the pilot's family
we are all moath it said in arabic beneath a picture representing a fighter jet in the colors of the jordanian flag
from the start jordan has played a <unk> part in the u.s. led coalition against isis but it was not a popular war within jordan which only added to the pressure on the authorities to secure al <unk> release
in late december isis published in its english language online magazine <unk> what it claimed was an interview with the pilot
al kasasbeh was shown wearing what appeared to be an orange <unk>
asked whether he knew what isis would do with him he replied
yes
they will kill me
the militants claimed they captured al kasasbeh after he ejected from the <unk> of his f sixteen on december twenty four
the pilot was part of the u.s. led coalition airstrikes near isis de facto capital raqqa
images provided by isis's media wing and circulated widely on social media showed bearded men with <unk> pulling the terrified <unk> out of a nearby river
we entered the region of raqqa to <unk> the area then the <unk> jets entered to begin their attack al kasasbeh said according to the online publication
my plane was struck by a heat seeking missile
i heard and felt its hit
the jordanian government and u.s. central command said the aircraft had crashed but <unk> stated isis had not shot it down as the group claims
i checked the system display and it indicated that the engine was damaged and burning the pilot was quoted as saying
the plane began to <unk> from its normal flight path so i ejected
i landed in the <unk> river by <unk> and the seat caught on some ground keeping me fixed until i was captured by soldiers of the islamic state
that was the question following a new message purportedly from the terrorist group that pushed jordan to bring convicted terrorist sajida al rishawi to the turkish border by five thirty p.m.
if they didn't according to the message jordanian pilot moaz al kassasbeh would be killed followed soon <unk> by kenji goto of japan
for days jordanian officials have said they're willing to swap al rishawi for al kassasbeh
government spokesman mohammed al <unk> reiterated as much late thursday afternoon about an hour before the purported deadline
he said jordan is not about to pull off a deal yet having received no proof that its pilot is still alive
we need a proof of life so we can <unk> the government spokesman said
if jordan gets such proof and releases al rishawi it is not clear whether that would mean goto also goes free
or al kassasbeh for that matter
so the drama continues with so much <unk> and so much on the line
early friday japan's foreign minister described the situation as still <unk> and changing
we need to continue to deal with this in a state of alert <unk> <unk> told reporters
isis has shown its willingness to kill hostages before the first being american journalist james foley last summer and the latest being haruna yukawa an aspiring security contractor from japan reportedly killed last week
but is it willing to negotiate with governments that are fighting to stop its brutal <unk> campaign to expand what it calls the islamic state
the drama is coming after the latest message posted by isis supporters purportedly featuring goto's voice
cnn could not independently confirm the authenticity of the latest message which was read by a person claiming to be goto and posted online by isis supporters
al <unk> said that the <unk> authorities are still checking on the authenticity of the recent recording state tv reported about two hours before the possible deadline
it follows another recording in which isis at first demanded two hundred million dollar to free goto and yukawa
a few days later there was a new message this one with a man's voice claiming to be goto saying that the terror group was <unk> its ransom request and instead demanding a swap of the japanese journalist for al rishawi
in the third recording in this string goto purportedly gives jordan twenty four hours to release the convicted terrorist in exchange for my life
jordanian foreign minister <unk> <unk> had said his country would release al rishawi if isis released al kassasbeh
<unk> has said that the japanese journalist has not been forgotten
of course goto's release would be part of a prisoner exchange <unk> said
but the priority for jordan he made clear is al <unk> freedom
who are those involved in this complicated crisis involving several countries
al rishawi is an iraqi prisoner on death row in jordan for her role in two thousand and five bombings
goto an experienced war journalist has been at the center of several threats by isis since his capture
last week the group demanded two hundred million dollar from japan in exchange for goto and fellow japanese hostage haruna yukawa an aspiring security contractor
since then isis has claimed yukawa is dead but goto is still alive
al kassasbeh was captured by isis last month after the fighter jet he was flying crashed in syria
isis says he's still alive but jordan's foreign minister told cnn his government has asked for a proof of life but hasn't received it
they are not just captives but people with loved ones desperately seeking their release
the forty seven year old goto left japan last fall when his youngest of two daughters was a mere three weeks old
now his family including his wife <unk> who heard from his captors first on december two and most recently in a wednesday email with their final demand wants him back
my husband is a good and honest man who went to syria to show the plight of those who suffer she said in a statement released through the <unk> <unk> trust a nonprofit focused on freelance journalists
i beg the jordanian and japanese government to understand that the <unk> of both are in their hands
relatives of the jordanian pilot captured after he ejected from his f sixteen jet last month near raqqa the extremist group's de facto capital in syria have also been <unk> pressing officials in <unk> to do all they can to secure his release
i firmly ask <unk> has sent moaz to fight outside the borders of jordan on a mission unrelated to us to make strong efforts to bring back moaz the <unk> father safi al kassasbeh said tuesday adding that he believes his son's situation and goto's shouldn't be mixed up
safi al kassasbeh made his case again thursday evening after the sunset deadline had passed
i ask you in the name of god and his prophet and all the believers and the names of tens of millions in jordan and palestine in <unk> to release my son and the son of all <unk> who is your brother in the islam religion and because forgiveness is a message of the prophet he told reporters
those are the new details released by the indonesia's national transportation safety committee in a news conference thursday
though it's common for the co pilot to be in control of the aircraft significant questions still <unk> over the crash of the airasia jet
why did the plane start a sudden steep <unk>
was bad weather a factor
qz eight thousand five hundred and one crashed december twenty eight as it flew from the indonesian city of surabaya toward singapore
there were one hundred and sixty two people on board
the plane was in good condition and entire crew were all <unk> said mardjono <unk> the chief investigator for the transportation committee
the flight took off and <unk> at thirty two thousand feet amid <unk> weather
about eleven twelve p.m. <unk> the pilot asked the control tower whether it could <unk> to thirty eight thousand feet according to the committee
the plane was <unk> left and <unk> said <unk> <unk> <unk> a senior pilot and investigator with the committee
qz eight thousand five hundred and one then ascended from its cruising altitude to thirty seven thousand four hundred feet in about thirty seconds in a steep <unk> said mardjono
commercial planes are not designed to <unk> so quickly analysts have said
it may have been climbing at a rate twice as fast as it could and should one analyst told cnn
the stall warnings which <unk> the words stall stall went on as the plane started the steep climb and continued until it crashed according to information on the flight data recorder
the voice warning doesn't always mean the aircraft has stalled said mardjono
the warning can be triggered when the angle of attack which is the angle at which the wing <unk> the <unk> wind hits eight degrees
the plane dropped quickly falling to twenty four thousand feet out of radar detection
air traffic control <unk> the plane to <unk> to thirty four thousand feet about four minutes after the pilot's initial request
officials have said that the aircraft climbed rapidly before it fell into the water
last week indonesian transportation minister <unk> jonan said the airasia jet stalled after its sudden <unk>
investigators have submitted their preliminary report into the crash officials said
but <unk> <unk> the chief of the national transportation safety committee said they would not release the preliminary report during a thursday news briefing
why was airasia jet the only one in trouble
it's unclear whether or when the initial report will be released fully to the public
while the preliminary report presents facts officials indicated there isn't enough <unk> yet
the french co pilot <unk> <unk> <unk> had less experience than the captain
<unk> forty six had two thousand two hundred and seventy five hours with airasia indonesia compared with the captain known only as <unk> who had six thousand one hundred hours on airasia on the airbus three hundred and twenty
<unk> had more than twenty thousand flying hours under his belt having worked for another airline in indonesia for thirteen years before that and had been a indonesian air force pilot for a decade prior
but it's common for the co pilot to be in control of the aircraft
they usually <unk> back and forth said david soucie a cnn aviation expert
and that's a matter of <unk> experience
you wouldn't want one pilot to get all the flight time and the others not to be current on what's going on
indonesian aviation investigators are trying to establish why flight eight thousand five hundred and one went down in an area of heavy thunderstorms last month while other planes nearby completed their journeys safely
authorities have recovered seventy two bodies from the sea with ninety still <unk> for according to airasia
few people would consider those with loved ones on airasia flight qz eight thousand five hundred and one lucky but sarah <unk> has a particular perspective
i'm almost a little <unk> in a way because you know at least they have this ability to put some <unk> to it she told cnn's new day on tuesday after the wreckage of the airasia flight was found
her partner philip woods was on board malaysia airlines flight three hundred and seventy which disappeared without a trace almost ten months ago
we're still in <unk>
there's still no evidence as to what happened to the plane she said struggling to hold back tears
earlier before the discovery of the airasia flight <unk> described feeling an incredible <unk>
she said
it's a physical pain through your whole body
and just <unk> what all those families are feeling as well i can imagine it
unfortunately i know exactly what they're going through
so does <unk> weeks whose husband was on mh three hundred and seventy
the plane disappeared from radar <unk> on a flight between malaysia and china on march eight
on sunday airasia flight qz eight thousand five hundred and one went missing over the java sea on its way from the indonesian city of surabaya to singapore with one hundred and sixty two people on board
debris was recovered tuesday in the waters off indonesia
the last few days has been <unk>
it's brought everything back
we're just <unk> what we've gone through weeks said
it's a horrible nightmare
<unk> said families of mh three hundred and seventy victims have <unk> together as they wake up each day without their loved ones
and it's vital that relatives of airasia eight thousand five hundred and one reach out for support weeks said
you just have to call on your close friends and family she said
you need to <unk> on them because they are basically the only way you get through this
nine months none of us are as strong as we used to be
in the weeks following mh three hundred and <unk> disappearance the grand <unk> at beijing's <unk> hotel turned into the briefing room for relatives of those on board the flight
every day the families came in hoping for a miracle
and every day they left <unk>
on tuesday the <unk> was dark and empty
the family assistance center was closed
many families feel they've been forgotten
but the search for mh three hundred and seventy goes on
crews are still <unk> the southern indian ocean with a variety of high tech equipment
but no wreckage has been found
at the malaysian government's request australia is leading the search efforts
the australian transport safety bureau said last week that the <unk> of the sea floor continues and a vessel is still searching underwater for the plane
our work will continue to be <unk> and <unk> so sometimes weekly progress may seem slow the <unk> said
please be assured that work is continuing and is aimed at finding mh three hundred and seventy as quickly as possible
but families of those passengers and crew may have to wait even longer
assuming no significant delays with vessels equipment or from the weather the current underwater search area may be largely completed around may two thousand and fifteen the <unk> said
weeks has no choice but to wait
we will never find peace until we do what's right by our loved ones and that's bring them home to us

the libyan branch of isis released photos of the two gunmen it said had carried out the attacks identifying them as abu <unk> al <unk> and abu <unk> al <unk>
their naming convention indicates that the men were of tunisian and sudanese origin respectively
the fbi is expected to open an investigation into the incident two u.s. officials told cnn
according to military records berry was in the u.s. marine corps <unk> six <unk> in afghanistan <unk> and iraq
he retired in september two thousand and twelve after a dozen years of service
he was working for <unk> a security firm
according to its website the virginia based firm provides high risk environment training and global security solutions to employees of the u.s. government <unk> and <unk> corporations who live and work in dangerous and <unk> locations worldwide
his father said berry was <unk> in arabic and knew his way around the arab world
he knew how to approach arabic people on a foreign shore and not
<unk> against them not come across as i'm am american warrior and i'm going to do it this way
he was very conciliatory in nature james berry said
his son leaves behind a wife and four children
the other foreigners killed in the attack were a french citizen and three people from <unk> al naas said
the french foreign ministry confirmed that a french citizen was among the dead but did not identify the victim
the tripoli government which is not internationally recognized said the intended target of the attack was its prime minister omar al <unk> but the claim has not been confirmed
al naas said that at least two libyan security personnel were killed in the attack
an online group that supports isis said the attack was carried out in the name of abu <unk> al <unk>
he was an alleged al qaeda operative accused of involvement in the bombing of u.s. embassies in africa
he was captured by u.s. special forces in tripoli in two thousand and thirteen
he died in a u.s. hospital this month
it's this declared link to al <unk> capture by the united states that has prompted the fbi to investigate
fighters loyal to isis have for several months been in control of the mediterranean port city of <unk> in eastern libya near the border with egypt
they are suspected in other attacks elsewhere in libya including in <unk> al <unk> and tripoli
tuesday's attack began when militants detonated a car bomb in the parking lot of the hotel
the gunmen then shot their way into the hotel
the high rise hotel is popular among government officials some of whom live there
until now it was seen as one of the remaining secure locations in tripoli for diplomatic and government activity
the attack different in scale and coordination to those seen previously even after months of violence in <unk> east sends the message that nowhere in the country or its capital is safe
authorities say they are now in control of the hotel <unk> and are starting their investigation
the self proclaimed tripoli government formed by a coalition of militias holds <unk> only over the capital and surrounding areas
the internationally recognized parliament was forced to leave the capital after militia groups seized control of the city in the summer
the u.s. embassy in tripoli the united nations and other international organizations and businesses also evacuated their <unk> from tripoli in the summer due to the unrest
the u.s. state department last week issued a warning <unk> u.s. citizens against all travel to libya and <unk> that any u.s. citizens currently in the north african country should leave immediately
extremist groups in libya have made several specific threats against u.s. government officials citizens and interests in libya it said
because of the <unk> that foreigners especially u.s. citizens in libya may be associated with the u.s. government or u.s
non governmental organizations travelers should be aware that they may be targeted for kidnapping violent attacks or death
using powerful <unk> they have found a much larger planet like body j one thousand four hundred and seven b with rings two hundred times the size of <unk> u.s. and dutch astronomers said
it lies some four hundred light years away from earth
for decades scientists have believed that many <unk> around large <unk> formed out of such ring systems
but this is the first one astronomers have observed outside of our solar system they said
it was discovered in two thousand and twelve but a detailed analysis of its data was recently completed and published
if j one thousand four hundred and seven b were in our solar system it would <unk> earth's <unk> sky
if we could replace <unk> rings with the rings around j one thousand four hundred and seven b they would be easily visible at night and be many times larger than the full moon said matthew <unk> from the netherlands <unk> observatory
unlike <unk> <unk> a relatively short distance through his simple telescope today's astronomers can't <unk> the rings hundreds of light years away
but using two very powerful <unk> devices with eight cameras each they can observe the effect the rings have as they pass across nearby star j one thousand four hundred and seven written without a b at the end
it is similar to our sun
the rings of planet j one thousand four hundred and seven b <unk> its light
with the enormous size of the rings the <unk> the astronomers observed lasted fifty six days
but the star did not go completely dark for nearly two months
some of j one thousand four hundred and seven <unk> thirty rings are <unk> blocking more light and some of them are less dense letting more light through
and there are <unk> between the rings leading the scientists to <unk> that <unk> have formed and cut clean <unk> through the debris like the <unk> around <unk>
our own solar <unk> <unk> giant has at least sixty <unk> according to nasa
like its system of rings planet j one thousand four hundred and seven b is also much larger than <unk> said <unk> eric <unk> whose team at the university of <unk> discovered the object
you could think of it as kind of a super <unk>
it is called a brown <unk> a size <unk> somewhere between a planet and a star according to the california institute of technology
brown <unk> are hot but don't burst into nuclear <unk> the way stars do so they don't give off light
the scientists are calling on <unk> astronomers to keep an eye on star j one thousand four hundred and seven in hopes they may observe the rings <unk> it again and report the results to the american association of <unk> star observers which <unk> <unk> data on stars that change in <unk>
and astronomers will also search for more such <unk> systems
for two weeks boko haram gunmen have <unk> dozens of villages in <unk> district close to the border with cameroon <unk> male residents and <unk> others said <unk> <unk> a lawmaker representing <unk> district in the <unk> state house of assembly
they move house to house killing people including the old <unk> women and children and burning homes <unk> said tuesday
he said villages are <unk> with bodies and there is no one to bury them because residents have fled thousands of them heading off into the mountains or across the border into cameroon to escape the onslaught
they slaughter people like animals he said
now seventy percents of the people in the district have been <unk> from the homes
some of them have run into the mountains while others have crossed into cameroon or fled to <unk> the capital of <unk> state <unk> said
the villagers ordeal is horrific but sadly nothing new for boko haram
the terrorist group its name <unk> as western education is <unk> has been a force in nigeria for years
it tries to use religion to justify its actions which are aimed at imposing its strict version of of sharia law in nigeria which is split between a majority muslim north and a mostly christian south
boko haram has intensified its attacks in recent years standing defiant against the nigerian military
and it hasn't gone after only government troops or officials with civilians often becoming victims
the group has been tied to a spate of <unk> market bombings attacks on churches and <unk> mosques and raids of villages including those earlier this month in <unk> district
mass kidnappings have also been part of its <unk> most notoriously the taking of more than two hundred schoolgirls from chibok last april
boys and young men have been abducted as well including forty between the ages of ten and twenty three reportedly taken captive on new year's eve in borno state and ninety seven others kidnapped in and around the village of <unk> baga in august
and whether or not they were former captives boko haram may be <unk> about its use of child soldiers in its fight
an organization calling itself boko haram's official <unk> this week even <unk> an alleged military training camp for children on its twitter feed posting images of children in <unk> holding ak forty seven weapons
while cnn can not independently verify the authenticity of the photos intelligence sources said the images appear to be real and are consistent with the islamist extremist group's strategy of <unk> recruiting and training children
and the u.s. state department lent credibility to the report by tweeting a photo of the young heavily armed children along with these words
amid its <unk> of <unk> boko haram running training camps for child soldiers
the release of these photos and the new twitter account appear to <unk> with an ever more sophisticated media strategy on the part of boko haram
the change in tactics appears to <unk> isis even down to the use of islamic <unk> or <unk>
last week a video was posted on the same account purporting to be an interview with boko haram's spokesman
both the <unk> and the subject were masked and the production values were far more sophisticated than anything the terror group has published before
boko haram's campaign has left thousands of <unk> in danger in some cases with the central government and others seemingly unable to help
the latest bloodshed began in <unk> <unk> which boko haram took over in september and declared to be part of its caliphate
the insurgents then moved into villages including <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
humanitarian workers have been unable to reach residents who fled into the mountains said mohammed <unk> head of the national emergency management agency for northeast nigeria
we are aware there are people trapped in the mountains but they are <unk>
the security situation is a challenge in reaching them and offering them humanitarian assistance <unk> said
<unk> said the military has not responded to complaints that he and other community leaders <unk> calling for its intervention
sometimes we alert the military when they are advancing on villages before they attack but no action is taken to stop them he said
these insurgents have been killing with impunity
when they attack a village they will sleep there for the night after the slaughter and move on the next morning the lawmaker said
there has been no reaction from the military to <unk> specific allegation
amnesty international on wednesday <unk> a similar <unk> saying it had evidence that the nigerian military was warned repeatedly about <unk> boko haram attacks on civilians late last year on <unk> and monguno
these attacks are an urgent wake up call for the nigerian leadership the african union and the international community said <unk> <unk> <unk>
it is essential to protect hundreds of thousands of civilians in northeast nigeria from boko haram's continued onslaught
the nigerian defense ministry responded by calling the allegation <unk> saying that <unk> use of these unfortunate activities of terrorists to find fault with the counterterrorism operations as usual is <unk> and <unk>
the defense ministry said its forces have enhanced their intelligence <unk> <unk> <unk> and coordination and logistics capabilities
in actual fact the protection of civilian populations is the essence of the entire counterterrorism operation the ministry said
indeed the troops were prepared and <unk> engaged the terrorists in all the instances referred to by amnesty international
its ability to win the release of a jailed jihadist in jordan or the ability of its followers in libya to attack a tripoli hotel may provide brief propaganda <unk> but they don't affect the <unk> on the ground
nor will its attempts to export terror to europe
but <unk> anyone declare victory predictions of isis <unk> are wildly optimistic
isis still controls some fifty thousand square kilometers of iraq as well as up to thirty percents of syrian territory and at least ten percents of its population
to the west of baghdad it is still on the offensive in <unk> and recently raided <unk> on the iraqi saudi border
pentagon spokesman rear <unk> john kirby said last week
we're only six to seven months into this <unk> is going to be a long struggle
a senior official at the u.s. state department echoed <unk> line this week saying isis <unk> from kobani is part of the early phase of a multi year campaign
isis is a very <unk> organization the official said and terms like turning point were to be avoided
even so there's quite a contrast between september when u.s. officials said the fall of kobani to isis seemed inevitable and kurds celebrating on the city's streets this week
isis chose kobani as a symbol of its <unk> even sending hostage john <unk> there to make a video about the group's inevitable victory
kobani was a recruitment poster in isis efforts to draw more foreign fighters to the caliphate
isis continued to <unk> its presence in the town despite constant airstrikes
general john <unk> u.s. coordinator of the campaign against isis said in november that the group had <unk> itself on kobani
the state department official said isis losses there likely running into four figures could help counter the messaging that has attracted foreign fighters
a narrative of inevitable <unk> and <unk> had been replaced by images of bodies left on the streets the official said
a growing number of those foreign fighters may also be <unk> after several months of airstrikes
<unk> in kobani and elsewhere have led to a stream of <unk> dozens of whom have been executed according to local activists cited by the syrian observatory on human rights
analysts say one trend in coming months may be a stream of <unk> foreigners trying to escape isis territory
in iraq a leading expert on isis <unk> al <unk> told cnn that isis has now lost ground in several areas and needs to <unk>
<unk> soltvedt a senior analyst at <unk> <unk> <unk> agrees that isis is on the back foot in iraq relying more on classic insurgency tactics such as <unk> bombs and unable to move in force because of the threat of airstrikes
among its latest <unk> isis has lost control over a number of villages in the province of diyala north east of baghdad
iraqi troops and shia militia known as popular <unk> units launched an offensive last week to retake isis last strongholds around <unk> fifty miles from the capital
according to iraqi commanders the whole province of diyala is now back in government hands after several months of <unk> battles
soltvedt says it became increasingly difficult for isis to sustain its supply lines in the region
the key prize for all sides in iraq remains mosul a city of one point five million people on the <unk> river held by isis since last june
isis has invested heavily in governing the city
its leader abu bakr al baghdadi pronounced his leadership of the caliphate at the grand mosque there last july
for their part kurdish officials say that as long as isis holds mosul it threatens kurdistan
likewise neither the government in baghdad nor its coalition partners can rest while terrorists occupy iraq's second largest city
peshmerga forces have made steady progress against isis north and west of mosul over the last two months
they have taken some three thousand square kilometers of the sinjar area as well as the area around the mosul dam <unk> off access routes and threatening isis main <unk> route to syria
to the south iraqi forces gains around <unk> have also restricted isis freedom of movement
the institute for the study of war which studies military activity in iraq and syria says isis is preparing to dig a <unk> <unk> around mosul and has blown up a bridge on a key western approach
<unk> also reports an increase in executions by isis across <unk> province where mosul is located which it sees as further evidence isis is feeling <unk> by internal resistance in the province
there had been talk of a january offensive to retake mosul but any assault now seems many weeks away
kirby told cnn's barbara <unk> tuesday that the timing could not be predicted but obviously we're working closely with iraqi security forces on helping them better understand the challenges of an assault on mosul
iraqi units are already fully occupied elsewhere notably in <unk> province where isis threatens <unk> and other areas
an assault on mosul would have to be <unk> co <unk> from several different <unk> informed by good intelligence and supported from the air
a massive intelligence gathering effort is already under way according to analysts
even so <unk> remaining residents are predominantly sunni arabs and would be <unk> of kurdish and shia militia so regular forces from the <unk> iraqi army would likely have to take the lead
the recent history of urban warfare in iraq should give <unk> analysts say <unk> the brutal battles to <unk> al qaeda from <unk> in two thousand and four
soltvedt says an uprising from within is much <unk> to an assault from without and some observers predict any operation to retake mosul wouldn't happen until early summer
another problem for isis is that coalition airstrikes and ground operations by iraqi and peshmerga forces appear to be <unk> away isis commanders even if claims by some us officials that half of isis leadership has been taken out appear optimistic
among prominent casualties reported by iraqi and kurdish officials in the past two months are isis governor for <unk> province abu <unk> <unk> and abu muslim al <unk> a member of isis <unk> council its highest policy making body
soltvedt says some of isis most <unk> fighters have also left iraq some returning to libya for example
more <unk> he says there is only a <unk> pool of skilled military commanders some of them former officers in <unk> <unk> army and they will have a problem <unk> them if they are killed
even where isis <unk> defeat there is no guarantee the iraqi government can secure and hold territory
the prominent role of shia militia may yet make it difficult for baghdad to <unk> areas after isis <unk>
during the diyala offensive the militia killed some seventy sunni civilians a local member of parliament <unk> al <unk> told reuters
others claimed the militia had burned down houses and mosques
the iraqi interior ministry denied the claims but it's not the first time these militia have been accused of <unk> during military <unk> and that may <unk> the <unk> of sunni tribes to help the government against isis
the iraqi government has proposed bringing the militia under the umbrella of a national guard
oil minister <unk> <unk> <unk> wrote on his facebook page that it would be possible to <unk> the shia popular <unk> forces the sunni sons of iraq and the peshmerga under the umbrella of the national guard knowing that the main goal of the latter is to prevent the emergence of militias put all the weapons under the <unk> of the state and provide <unk> forces when needed
but there is plenty of resistance to the idea because such militia have often been the best guarantee of a <unk> security
in areas it <unk> the iraqi government will have to provide security rehabilitation and effective governance to people who with good reason don't believe baghdad can provide any of the above
isis also benefits from being able to use both syrian and iraqi territory as the battlefield shifts
while under pressure in northern iraq its forces can <unk> across the border in syria's <unk> province
it can also use the <unk> from <unk> <unk> into iraq's <unk> province where it enjoys real strategic depth and the iraqi army struggles with long supply lines says soltvedt
it has even begun to probe the iraqi saudi border
isis also controls a number of small oil fields and an <unk> of <unk> captured in both iraq and syria
and it still has money
iraqi finance minister <unk> <unk> told reuters he estimates isis has <unk> four hundred and fifty six million dollar from banks in mosul <unk> and <unk> since june
and it has set up a <unk> <unk> system in the main cities it controls as well as a <unk> intelligence <unk>
but isis is finding the job of controlling much harder than that of attacking
it has needed an expensive and labor intensive mix of <unk> <unk> and policing to run mosul where the iraqi government still pays the <unk> of state employees <unk>
under pressure on several fronts isis now has to think very carefully about where it puts its forces says soltvedt
kirchner has sent a draft bill to the country's parliament which if passed would mean the <unk> of intelligence is replaced by the federal intelligence agency
in a <unk> statement aired monday night on national tv kirchner said the service had not served the interests of the country
the body of <unk> nisman a special prosecutor investigating the one thousand nine hundred and ninety four bombing of a jewish community center in buenos aires was found inside his apartment on january eighteen the day before he was due to testify before congress about his claims
the previous week he had filed a report alleging that the president foreign minister and other officials <unk> to cover up iran's involvement in the bomb attack which killed eighty five in exchange for an oil and grain for meat deal
nisman died of a gunshot wound to the temple
a gun and a shell <unk> were found near his body and the apartment was locked from the inside
at first glance a suicide
but the <unk> death raised <unk> immediately
then investigators looking into his death said there was no gunpowder <unk> on his hands as would have been expected and a <unk> who let nisman's mother into the apartment told reporters that anyone could have opened the <unk>
kirchner who initially called nisman's death a suicide soon <unk> her thinking and called it the suicide was not a suicide
however while fernandez does not believe that nisman took his own life she still insists that his allegations against her government are false
nisman was not a hack with an agenda against the president but a <unk> investigator who was used by others who fed him false information fernandez said
nisman's report promised to provide evidence of the existence of a sophisticated criminal plot deliberately <unk> to cover up and provide impunity to the iranians accused in the investigation of the attack of the jewish community center in one thousand nine hundred and ninety four
the two hundred and eighty nine page report makes its case based on <unk> telephone conversations between representatives of argentina and iran
you may <unk> those childhood aspirations as <unk> now you're an adult with responsibilities and bills to pay but that role reflected what you enjoyed doing and who you were at that time
the dream jobs we <unk> to as children are a window into our passions and <unk> says <unk> career expert <unk> williams
identifying and understanding those passions are key to improving our performance and <unk> of the jobs we currently do even if they aren't specific to the careers we dreamed of as kids
so what <unk> our childhood aspirations
when we're small most of us have a limited idea of what's out there explains career coach <unk> <unk>
it is shaped by the exposure we have the people that have a big impact on us and the standards and social expectations around us
our families greatly influence our <unk> on life
if we look up to one family member in particular we tend to be drawn to their careers as we want to be like them
indeed when <unk> was a little girl she wanted to be a <unk> because her grandmother who she <unk> was one
and it's not just our relatives roles at work that can influence children's aspirations
the gender roles that our parents take on at home can also dramatically impact our childhood career choices
a study by alyssa <unk> of the university of british <unk> found that the division of labor at home had implications for how girls identities developed in gender roles
<unk> told cnn that fathers behavior around the house seems to be <unk> their daughter's career aspirations beyond what they might be publicly <unk> or specifically saying about gender roles
she found that if fathers talked about supporting gender equality but didn't take on an equal role in domestic tasks then this sent conflicting signals to their daughters which led to daughters placing more weight on their father's actions rather than his words
by contrast where fathers demonstrated their beliefs in gender equality by taking on an equal distribution of domestic tasks then their daughters would select roles that are more gender <unk> or even sort of male <unk> like being a scientist or athlete <unk> says
and that could have a major impact on our pay check down the line
research by the london school of economics published in the journal social forces found that girls who <unk> to traditionally female dominated occupations were far more likely to earn lower wages in their first job since <unk> female jobs tend to pay less
<unk> male or female <unk> that children exhibit during childhood continue into and affect their adult lives says <unk> <unk> professor of social policy and <unk> at <unk>
our early experiences can also have a bearing on what we see as our dream job a positive experience linked to a potential career can be hugely inspiring

i thought it would be amazing job to try and influence important issues says <unk> <unk> head of <unk> at <unk>
when we are young our aspirations are a response to our circumstances
but <unk> says that when the time comes to start designing our careers we begin <unk> in to what we feel <unk> to express about ourselves
<unk> <unk> founder of <unk> social started out with a long and <unk> list of possible careers she went through <unk> of wanting to be a teacher a police officer an <unk> and an attorney
only in high school when i began <unk> computers did i become interested in tech and start ups which led me to attend <unk> and major in computer science she says
while many of us turn our backs on our childhood ambitions when faced with the <unk> of life as a grown up some really do end up in their dream jobs
a survey of the childhood career aspirations of more than eight thousand professionals from around the world carried out for social <unk> site <unk> found that thirty point three percents of the <unk> members were either currently in the job they had always dreamed of or in a career linked to those plans

sometimes our careers begin at such an early age that there's little to think about
four time <unk> champion <unk> <unk> <unk> started swimming when she was five
by the time she was eight she was competing against able <unk> children
i'm not sure i thought too much on what career i was interested in when i was a child she says
i always just wanted to have a farm and work with horses when i was very young though the thought of working with children is something i've thought about since
i'm very fortunate that my swimming career took off when i was very young so it was never really a question
but no matter how early we step on to that <unk> it's never too late to change <unk>
thinking back to our childhood ambitions can help us work out which aspects of our current job we love
after <unk> <unk> marine biologist phase passed she says i never had a single career in mind
i always <unk> myself being able to do many things at once

later this week the men's indonesian lawyers hope to file what's known as a <unk> to request a second judicial review
australian lawyer <unk> <unk> said there's a strong basis for another review to be granted
the first <unk> was filed four years ago and was eventually rejected however so the next step was the clemency process under the clemency law and the constitution <unk> said
however he said that while the matter was being considered by the offices of the previous and current president the law changed to allow for a second judicial review
he said it's not appropriate to file a second judicial review while the matter is sitting with the president
now that the letters from the president have rejected clemency that <unk> the second judicial review to be brought on

but even as the u.s. works closely with the saudis on common strategic goals like counterterrorism obama said he and his administration continue to apply steady consistent pressure on issues like human rights
obama is headed to saudi arabia to meet the new king salman and pay his respects following the death of king abdullah last week
sometimes we have to balance our need to speak to them about human rights issues with immediate concerns that we have in terms of <unk> terrorism or dealing with regional stability obama said in an interview with cnn's fareed zakaria in india on tuesday
during his visit tuesday obama will make paying respects the bigger priority <unk> directly answering a question from zakaria on whether obama would discuss with the saudis the case of the political activist and <unk> who was sentenced to twenty years in prison and one thousand lashes for his <unk>

what to expect when obama visits saudi arabia
and obama was <unk> that u.s. pressure to advance human rights or encourage political reforms isn't always <unk> and <unk> that makes some of our allies uncomfortable
it makes them frustrated he said
and you know some of them listen and some don't obama said
in the list of those who don't obama recalled the <unk> of the egyptian dictatorship of <unk> mubarak the former president of egypt who was <unk> in egypt's two thousand and eleven revolution
mubarak was one of the <unk> closest allies in the region during his three decades in office thanks in large part to a strong security agreement and mubarak's work to maintain peace with israel
obama said that he warned mubarak that the massive protests in <unk> square were not simply going to <unk> urging mubarak to get out in front of reform and become the father of the egyptian democracy
i said mr
president i don't think this is a <unk> that you can put back in the bottle obama recalled
he said ah mr. president you don't understand society here
this is all going to be fine
it'll blow over
and it didn't obama said
but the <unk> is one that i will sustain throughout the rest of my presidency and that is to make an argument to those friends and allies of <unk> that if they want a society that is going to be able to sustain itself in this age then they're going to have to change how they do business obama said
islamic law generally <unk> men from <unk> women to whom they are not related
however that rule is often times <unk> when official diplomatic <unk> visit the kingdom
the white house notes that representatives of the united states including former <unk> of state hillary clinton and <unk> <unk> along with german chancellor angela merkel have all visited the saudi king and have all shaken hands with members of the saudi royal family
islamic experts also point to another central theme of islam

obama also did not cover her head <unk> strict religious and cultural customs in saudi arabia where women wear a full body garment called an <unk> and cover their heads with a <unk> or the more conservative niqab which has only a <unk> for the eyes
obama's predecessor <unk> bush also did not cover her head during her two thousand and seven solo visit to saudi arabia and neither did hillary clinton during a two thousand and ten trip to the kingdom as secretary of state
another former secretary of state <unk> rice also did not cover her head as she joined the u.s. delegation in saudi arabia on tuesday
but the u.s. state department <unk> other american women visiting the country that they could face problems if they don't cover their heads
women who choose not to <unk> to this dress code face a risk of confrontation by <unk> and possible detention arrest the state department says on its website
while most incidents have resulted only in inconvenience or <unk> the potential exists for an individual to be arrested physically <unk> or <unk>
additionally female tourists who don't abide by the dress code or <unk> other religious laws like walking in public <unk> or <unk> with men who aren't relatives risk being <unk> pursued or assaulted by saudi citizens the state department warns
pool reporters traveling with the president on air force one also pointed out that in the receiving line at the airport in saudi arabia a more open setting than the palace michelle obama stood next to but slightly behind the president and held a small black <unk> <unk> in front of her with both hands
reporters say they noticed that <unk> obama waited for a gesture to be made to her by the men who walked by and if the man <unk> a <unk> she <unk> and shook their hand

eight year old alyssa carter
when i heard that rhinos were being killed they were my favorite animals and i wanted to start this says the <unk> school <unk>
her campaign <unk> save the rhinos has raised thousands of dollars to protect her favorite animal south africa's <unk> threatened rhinoceros and fund an innovative <unk> aimed at tracking the hunters who would do them harm
carter south africa national parks one and only rhino champion sells <unk> <unk> for ten <unk> at her school
so far she has raised over twenty three thousand dollar through a combination of chocolate sales and donations from the growing number of people young and old who have filled <unk> to hear the young <unk> speak
it all started in may two thousand and thirteen when carter then aged six and a half came home from school and drew a picture
the same <unk> image of long <unk> rhino beneath a <unk> that is now <unk> on her <unk> sweets and chocolate
her father brian carter says she'd been taught about the plight of endangered animals and burst out crying when she heard rhinos were being <unk> by poachers
at home that night the family resolved to do something to help <unk> on the <unk> as a good place to start
her father was her first customer
originally she just wanted to do something to help he says
the idea was to sell to anybody that would buy so we started off by selling to friends and family <unk> and <unk> and people at church
for over a year she has been selling <unk> every friday at her supportive johannesburg primary school and has now grown her stall with rhino branded <unk> <unk> <unk> and a range of <unk> rhino toys created by a well <unk> who had heard about her fundraising efforts
carter knows her most enthusiastic customers
<unk> out one particularly generous <unk> teacher <unk> and an <unk> sweet <unk> class of her <unk> as her biggest supporters
dogs take bite out of poaching
what alyssa wanted to do was to give the money toward buying trained <unk> dogs to go into the kruger national park says dad brian
there across an area the size of new jersey park rangers fight a desperate battle with poachers to prevent the extinction of the rhinoceros whose horn is prized for its supposed value in traditional asian <unk>
highly trained <unk> are a new addition to the park first arriving in two thousand and twelve
if they find a rhino lying dead they can <unk> out where the poachers are explains alyssa carter allowing rangers track poachers just as the poachers themselves <unk> <unk>
dogs will soon patrol the park's entrance points too <unk> weapons that poachers attempt to <unk> in and <unk> including rhinoceros horn being transported out
at kruger south africa's largest wildlife reserve park authorities report an increase in contact with suspected poachers with rangers claiming before christmas that one hundred and sixty four had been arrested in the park over the year
with each dog's purchase training and <unk> costs running to over eight thousand dollar per dog they aren't cheap but the young rhino champion can now proudly <unk> to have already added two new <unk> nine <unk> to the battle
but why rhinos
they're nice and with their big horns they look beautiful and i like looking for them in the wild explains carter
before starting <unk> save the rhinos the johannesburg resident had never seen a rhinoceros in its natural habitat
now she's been to kruger several times she says on invitation to meet the park's other <unk> rangers on a few <unk> and recently visiting two <unk> dogs in training last summer
she <unk> snaps photographs of every animal she sees in the park but rhinos hold a special place
it's really nice because i know i'm doing something she says
carter says she keeps count of each of the rhino she sees and is up to one hundred and thirty something so far
carter is keen to talk to others about her experiences with rhinos standing up in front of seven hundred students at a school in december and nearly three hundred adults at a development conference earlier that year
she says it's just as easy to talk to grown ups as kids as long as her father is by her side
the elder carter says he wasn't involved in conservation before alyssa started her campaign and that the whole family has caught the young <unk> enthusiasm
the ambition now is for alyssa to talk at more corporate events including business golf days where she has found success encouraging <unk> to give to the cause
the bottom line is we need to raise more money says brian and we need to sell more <unk>
the basic tracks for the <unk> <unk> michael <unk> composition had been done a week earlier but it was this january twenty eight one thousand nine hundred and eighty five session that counted the one that included <unk> <unk> bob dylan ray charles <unk> <unk> and many other of the biggest artists of the day
we are the world was a way to raise money to fight a <unk> in <unk> and other parts of africa following in the <unk> path <unk> by band <unk> do they know it's christmas
the single credited to usa for africa sold more than twenty million copies and <unk> the <unk> for four weeks in april and may
it was a big deal at the time
even <unk> <unk> <unk> got involved
in the decades that have followed there have been other attempts at all star charity records and <unk> some hugely successful others all but ignored

a message purporting to be from the islamist terror group sets a new deadline for a possible deal with the jordanian government
the latest demand
bring convicted terrorist sajida al rishawi to the turkish border by sunset thursday or jordanian isis hostage moaz al kassasbeh will be executed immediately
but is isis offering anything in return
from the latest message it's unclear
but previous video posts purportedly from isis have suggested the group was offering japanese hostage kenji goto's freedom in exchange for al <unk>
cnn could not independently confirm the authenticity of the latest message which was read by a person claiming to be goto and posted online by isis supporters
in the message goto purportedly calls for al <unk> release in exchange for my life
it's the latest <unk> in a complicated crisis with <unk> developments involving several countries
here's a look at the key people involved
goto an experienced japanese war journalist has been at the center of several threats by isis since his capture
last week the group demanded two hundred million dollar from japan in exchange for goto and fellow japanese hostage haruna yukawa an aspiring security contractor
since then isis has claimed yukawa is dead but goto is still alive
al kassasbeh a jordanian pilot was captured by isis last month after the fighter jet he was flying crashed in syria
isis says he's still alive but jordan's foreign minister told cnn his government has asked for a proof of life but hasn't received it
al rishawi is an iraqi prisoner on death row in jordan for her role in two thousand and five bombings
isis has demanded her release by sunset thursday
jordan has said it's willing to swap al rishawi for the jordanian pilot
jordanian foreign minister <unk> <unk> told cnn on wednesday that his country would release al rishawi if isis released al kassasbeh
even though his government's announcement of its offer doesn't mention goto the foreign minister said that the japanese journalist is not forgotten
of course goto's release would be part of a prisoner exchange <unk> told cnn's christiane amanpour
but the priority for jordan is al <unk> freedom he said
it wasn't clear whether isis would accept jordan's offer
with the <unk> of their sons hanging in the balance the families of goto and al kassasbeh called on their governments to do everything they can to save the hostages before time runs out
goto forty seven is reported to have three children two of them with his current wife
his mother begged japanese prime minister shinzo abe to secure her son's release
please save the life of kenji junko ishido said
i call on you to work with all your strength in negotiations with the jordanian government until the very end
al <unk> father has called on jordanian authorities to act as well
i firmly ask <unk> has sent moaz to fight outside the borders of jordan on a mission unrelated to us to make strong efforts to bring back moaz safi al kassasbeh said tuesday
isis says it captured al kassasbeh after he ejected from his f sixteen jet last month near raqqa the militant group's de facto capital in syria
<unk> blood is precious it's precious and it represents the blood of all <unk> his father said
but the pilot's father suggested his son's case shouldn't be mixed up with goto's
to link <unk> situation with the japanese journalist this has nothing to do with us he said
the japanese journalist has his country to defend him
isis which holds large areas of iraq and syria under its brutal rule has a grim track record of <unk> killing hostages
last year it <unk> its series of beheadings of three american and two british captives
the group has made a series of demands regarding the jordanian and japanese hostages
in a saturday post purportedly from isis a voice thought to be goto's first set out the idea of <unk> him for al rishawi but no clear deadline was mentioned
in that post goto held a photo of what appeared to be yukawa's <unk> corpse
a post from the group on tuesday announced that time was suddenly in short supply for goto and the jordanian pilot
in that message the japanese hostage is shown <unk> and dressed in orange holding a picture that appears to be al kassasbeh
i've been told this is my last message a voice purporting to be that of goto says demanding the prisoner exchange
the video had said that isis would kill al kassasbeh and goto within twenty four hours if jordan did not release al rishawi
cnn couldn't independently verify the authenticity of the messages
the japanese government said there was no evidence so far that it wasn't goto speaking in tuesday's video which was posted to youtube and distributed on social media by known isis supporters
on thursday japan's prime minister told lawmakers his government was analyzing the latest possible message from isis
given the nature of the issue we can not tell concrete details abe said
however within this extremely severe context the government has been <unk> cooperation from the government of jordan and will continue making the utmost effort for swift release of mr. goto

we did this to send a message to the syrian regime that we view it responsible for what <unk> on its territory and that there is a price to pay for allowing hezbollah to use your positions <unk> said
if the syrians think they are going to open up a new front on the golan after forty years we are not willing to accept that
the golan heights were part of syria until the six day war in one thousand nine hundred and sixty seven

haze episodes have occurred in southeast asia nearly every year since
back in one thousand nine hundred and ninety eight and for years afterwards tan didn't think too deeply about them
yet at some point in his late twenty s he began to wonder
where did the haze come from
and why did it keep coming back
air pollution kills around seven million people every year according to the world health organization <unk> for one in eight deaths worldwide in two thousand and twelve
the main causes of death were stroke and heart disease followed by chronic <unk> <unk> disease <unk> cancer and respiratory infections among children
it is especially bad in the asia pacific region which has a population of over four point two billion and high population <unk>
china and india alone with a combined population of around two point seven billion are both enormous sources and victims of air pollution
in two thousand and ten forty percents of the world's premature deaths caused by air pollution were in china the world's largest <unk> of carbon <unk> according to a survey published in the <unk>
the university of hong kong's school of public health reported more than three thousand premature deaths in the city in two thousand and thirteen and the situation in many mainland chinese cities is <unk> to be far worse
a poll by the u.s. <unk> research center found that forty seven percents of chinese citizens thought air pollution to be a very big problem in two thousand and thirteen
it is now a central focus for many chinese environmental groups and a growing source of anxiety for the country's leadership
similar health concerns are building in india where air pollution is now the fifth leading cause of death
between two thousand and two thousand and ten the annual number of premature deaths linked to air pollution across india rose six <unk> to six hundred and twenty thousand according to the center for science and environment a public interest research and advocacy group in new delhi
in may two thousand and fourteen the who said that new delhi had the worst air of one thousand six hundred cities surveyed worldwide and that rising air pollution had increased the risk of <unk> <unk> and heart disease
another two thousand and fourteen study has linked a significant drop in india's <unk> and rice crop <unk> to rising levels of two air <unk> black carbon from rural <unk> <unk> and ground level <unk> formed from <unk> vehicle <unk> industrial emissions and chemical <unk> between one thousand nine hundred and eighty and two thousand and ten
in both china and india air pollution is one <unk> of a massive exodus from farm to city that has occurred in recent decades
the change has contributed to rising emissions from both vehicles and factories especially coal fired power plants and an emerging middle class that increasingly <unk> a range of <unk> goods that are common in europe and the united states
southeast asia has <unk> similar problems in recent decades as its economies and populations have <unk>
in fact according to the who nearly one million of the three point seven million people who died from <unk> air pollution in two thousand and twelve lived in southeast asia
but on top of <unk> and <unk> the region faces an added burden
smoke haze produced in indonesia that is a by product of the world's fifty billion dollar palm oil industry
in the summer of two thousand and thirteen a plane carried tan <unk> <unk> over the straits of <unk> to <unk> the capital of riau province the largest palm oil production region in indonesia
tan then a twenty eight year old financial <unk> was <unk> with the global environment center a malaysian group that has worked for years to prevent and mitigate haze
he traveled to the heart of neighboring indonesia just after a record breaking haze episode hit <unk> malaysia
on a driving tour in riau he saw endless <unk> of burned out landscapes
fires had turned <unk> peat <unk> the <unk> natural <unk> into land whose <unk> surface <unk> <unk>
these fires are to dry out the peatlands for <unk> uses mainly the cultivation of oil <unk>
but in some villages fires had even destroyed existing oil palm trees that belonged to <unk> companies or local farmers
tan had a <unk> encounter in the village of <unk> <unk>
a couple there <unk> him with tea and <unk> then quietly asked if he could spare any of his own food for them
their daughter had developed a respiratory problem because of the haze
the surprise medical bill coupled with the fire <unk> their oil palm crops had left the family <unk> and hungry
until that moment he had mostly thought of peat <unk> as forest fires as they are often called in media reports
but here was a <unk> reminder that the fires affect working land and real people
it really touched me said tan
i made a promise to myself that i'd do my best to prevent them from suffering from fires again
it was an issue he felt that required far more public discussion and when the time was right action
i must get more people involved he had thought and turn this into a movement
<unk> skies may all look similar but the emissions from any particular source are unique
a factory <unk> in beijing releases a different mix of chemical <unk> into the atmosphere than an <unk> <unk> in new delhi does
and the extent of pollution in a given city will depend on how carefully emissions are controlled and how easily they can be <unk>
vehicle and factory emissions have been <unk> for decades in high income countries but haze smoke and its impact on health is not well understood
not many people have investigated it even though it's a very important phenomenon said <unk> <unk> an atmospheric <unk> at singapore's <unk> technological university
unlike factory and vehicle emissions <unk> smoke is not <unk> by <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> or other pollution <unk> applications
the composition of the smoke also <unk> widely according to the type of material that is burning
peatlands for example typically take a longer time to burn than <unk> matter just as a <unk> piece of wood takes longer to burn in a <unk>
according to the u.s. environmental protection agency peat fires burn at lower temperatures and produce smoke that is more harmful and in larger <unk> than the average forest fire or <unk> fire does
the emissions from a given peat fire will largely depend on the <unk> composition its burning temperature and how far below the ground the fire <unk>
but such details aren't yet available in indonesia whose peatlands cover an area roughly the size of the united kingdom
as a result <unk> told me we do not have a very <unk> <unk> of the country's <unk> fire data
<unk> burns indonesian peat in his singapore laboratory to study its chemical properties but his work is limited he said because he can never be sure whether his <unk> <unk> reality
indonesia has an enormous <unk> of tropical peatlands and for a generation areas of these have been burned to prepare the land for the cultivation of oil <unk>
peat smoke now <unk> around forty percents of indonesia's overall greenhouse gas emissions
palm oil is an <unk> in a range of <unk> products from <unk> to ice cream
yet it has also helped to give its source country the <unk> <unk> of being the world's third largest greenhouse gas <unk> after china and the united states as well as a leading source of <unk> smoke haze
on a summer afternoon the skies were a <unk> white in riau the indonesian province that <unk> about a quarter of indonesia's palm oil
my first stop was the headquarters of <unk> an ngo in the city of <unk> that <unk> the indonesian government for action on haze and other environmental problems
i arrived at <unk> headquarters a low rise residential building near the <unk> airport just as a group of farmers and environmental activists were <unk> haze over coffee and <unk> with sri <unk> <unk> a researcher for the secretary general of indonesia's parliament
<unk> said her boss had <unk> her to riau to <unk> a report on haze
at the meeting she explained that according to government estimates forest fires were generally not occurring in areas owned by large <unk>
government statements about haze are false
shouted an activist from a local ngo forest rescue riau network
and there's no coordination between ministers they just pass the blame around
the exchange <unk> the long running debate across southeast asia about who exactly is responsible for indonesia's peat fires
farmers and environmental groups often accuse companies many of which are <unk> in singapore or malaysia of <unk>
but many companies say such criticism is <unk> and that they have largely <unk> their destructive land clearing practices in recent years through <unk> reform initiatives like the <unk> on sustainable palm oil an industry led <unk>
whoever is right said <unk> the fires have damaged indonesia's international reputation and the indonesian government pays little attention to their health implications in riau and beyond
personally i don't think the government is managing this well she told me after the meeting
usually they just react after the fires start but they should think more about prevention
peat fires though are notoriously hard to predict and <unk>
they start and spread easily and sometimes <unk> depending on conditions like wind speed the depth of the soil and the <unk> of the air
it's really hard to know how bad a fire will be when it starts said <unk> <unk> a farmer in the riau village of <unk>
we were sitting in a <unk> caf <unk> by oil palm trees
<unk> told me that oil palm is the crop of choice for <unk> farmers because it is more valuable than <unk> rice
a <unk> of oil palm he said typically <unk> a farmer around forty eight million indonesian <unk> per year
<unk> rice by contrast brings in just forty million <unk>
but as oil palm cultivation has increased in the village so have fires
and they affect both corporate <unk> and <unk> farmers
if a fire happens and we can't control it we'll report it said <unk> a <unk> farmer
but sometimes even helicopters are powerless to stop the burning he added
and during the really bad fires a lot of the kids <unk> and end up at the clinic with health problems
in two thousand and nine indonesia passed a law <unk> fires on peat <unk>
farmers in <unk> told me that as a result they had started to clear peat <unk> <unk> without using fire
but <unk> said <unk> clearance is more labor intensive and requires extra <unk>
and that he said requires extra time and money that most farmers don't want to part with
when the wind <unk> from the west smoke can <unk> east across the straits of <unk> and into both singapore and <unk> <unk> <unk> home to about seven million people
south east asia is not the only place where the burning of <unk> <unk> over large areas
most of the world's fires occur in africa and south america
but southeast asia's fires are unique says <unk> <unk> an atmospheric researcher at <unk> university because they occur so close to dense urban centers
there are no <unk> studies on how repeated exposure to peat smoke affects human health over the long term much less how peat <unk> chemical properties <unk> from other kinds of <unk> smoke
yet emerging research offers early clues
u.s. researchers have found that peat fires in the southern states during the summer of two thousand and eight caused a <unk> in emergency room visits for heart failure and <unk> related respiratory <unk>
in a follow up study published in june two thousand and fourteen they burned <unk> <unk> peat from the fires in the <unk> of lab <unk>
subsequent <unk> problems in the <unk> were mainly linked to <unk> grained smoke particles and <unk> problems to <unk> grained particles
a primary concern from a health perspective is that peat fires tend to generate larger amounts of fine grained <unk> matter called pm two point five than normal forest fires
that is worrying mainly because <unk> grained particles are thought to <unk> further into the <unk> than <unk> ones do posing a potentially higher risk to the heart and other internal organs
<unk> grained particles are also harder to block with the simple <unk> masks that many people in asian cities have traditionally worn as protection against air pollution
a widely cited two thousand and twelve study published in the journal environmental health <unk> estimated that about three hundred and thirty nine thousand deaths between one thousand nine hundred and ninety seven and two thousand and six were associated with landscape fires
about four in five deaths were linked to chronic rather than <unk> exposure
sub <unk> africa and southeast asia accounted for one hundred and fifty seven thousand and one hundred and ten thousand deaths respectively and the rate of <unk> <unk> during years dominated by the el <unk> weather phenomenon which typically <unk> with <unk> conditions in southeast asia
reducing population level exposure to air pollution from landscape fires is a <unk> endeavor that is likely to have immediate and <unk> health benefits the researchers concluded
another two thousand and twelve study by <unk> <unk> and other scientists from american and british institutions found that between one and eleven percents of south east asia's population was repeatedly exposed to pollution above the who's recommended air quality levels during <unk> haze episodes between one thousand nine hundred and ninety seven and two thousand and six
<unk> exposure during el <unk> years caused around fifteen thousand <unk> linked adult deaths per year the researchers wrote
roughly two thirds of those were linked to fine grained pm two point five particles while the other third were linked to levels of <unk>
however there was not enough evidence available to determine exactly how the <unk> of pm two point five in peat fires <unk> from that of pm two point five emissions in american cities
some scientists suggest that peat <unk> long term effects on humans may be <unk> similar to those of urban air pollution which also includes pm two point five particles
no one is sure because so little research has been done to test the theory
<unk> <unk> an american environmental engineer who studies haze at the national university of singapore <unk> that long term exposure to haze episodes could potentially make the population less healthy over time even if people continue to live long lives
in a two thousand and thirteen study he and his colleagues found that the air above singapore during a smoke haze episode contained <unk> <unk> <unk> and other <unk> elements
they estimated that normal urban levels of pm two point five pollution would cause about twelve out of every million <unk> to develop cancer over a lifetime but if haze were to occur for ten days per year over seventy straight years the number of likely cancer cases would increase by nearly half
yet there still is no coordinated international effort to <unk> haze in a truly <unk> fashion
that is partly due to the <unk> and unpredictable nature of haze <unk> said
southeast asia's highly <unk> weather makes it <unk> to predict when haze will appear or where it could spread
he <unk> a <unk> of peat smoke to a <unk> that <unk> into the air shoots along <unk> then quickly <unk> back to earth only to jump again
another problem <unk> said is that the general public does not yet view haze as a serious health threat
people view it as oh <unk> it's a problem that <unk> in indonesia he told me one afternoon in his office at the national university of singapore
for governments and funding bodies the <unk> more <unk>
how to mitigate human exposure to this haze issue rather than to study the problem itself
the task of <unk> pollution is also <unk> by politics
countries in southeast asia have little control over what <unk> across their borders
unlike the european union the association of southeast asian nations <unk> the legal authority to force its members to act against their own interests
a case in point is <unk> two thousand and two <unk> <unk> haze agreement a non <unk> document in which the group's ten member states pledged to prevent and monitor peat fires
the agreement called for technology <unk> and other measures to improve regional dialogue and cooperation on haze
it was initially hailed as a landmark achievement but until september two thousand and fourteen indonesia's parliament had refused to <unk> it
<unk> m <unk> an environmental lawyer based in the indonesian capital of jakarta said that was mainly because indonesia has long tried to use the haze agreement as a way to <unk> singapore into <unk> a <unk> to <unk> indonesian citizens who are wanted for crimes in their homeland
<unk> <unk> to view economic development national <unk> and mutual non interference as its highest priorities said <unk> <unk> a senior <unk> in the department of international and strategic studies at the university of <unk>
in her view <unk> has taken a <unk> <unk> approach to haze fighting out of <unk> to powerful palm oil companies many of them based in singapore or malaysia
indeed many analysts have said that indonesia's land <unk> areas allocated for commercial <unk> are deeply <unk> with corruption
a popular joke has it that if indonesia's <unk> <unk> <unk> were all counted as national territory the country would grow in size
but companies and officials mostly refuse to share those <unk> with the public
it's a mess said <unk> <unk> a research analyst at the jakarta office of the world resources institute a research organization <unk> in washington <unk>
it's also another reason why indonesia's peatlands continue to burn
against this backdrop tan <unk> <unk> the singaporean financial <unk> and self <unk> haze activist is hoping to influence the regional debate on haze
in early two thousand and fourteen he founded a citizens organization called people's movement to stop haze or pm haze to kick start the discussion
my <unk> feeling is we need influence tan said at a sunday evening pm haze meeting
there was only one other <unk>
<unk> <unk> an indonesian <unk> who had joined the group after finding tan online
the venue was <unk> modest apartment in a middle class singapore neighborhood
in june two thousand and fourteen one of <unk> <unk> newspapers the independent dubbed him singapore's <unk> haze fighter
but pm haze with ten active members and no outside funding is well behind many established advocacy and research groups that fight air pollution elsewhere in asia
in new delhi the center for science and the environment has proposed specific ways that the government could tackle air pollution for example by cracking down on open fires
and in beijing the institute of public and environmental affairs is promoting a pollution monitoring mobile phone app as a way of <unk> up pressure on <unk> companies
by his own admission tan has very little experience in the non profit sector
he told me that he has no plans to pressure the government or companies into action at least not yet
for the moment he said pm haze is simply trying to learn about the problem in all its complexity and then communicate its findings to the singaporean public
in early november two thousand and fourteen the group developed the content for an <unk> haze exhibition in singapore that drew an estimated eight hundred visitors
and in the longer term tan said they would like to film a documentary in indonesia
my personal goal is to stop haze by two thousand and twenty three he added <unk>
that could be a <unk> dream
but according to <unk> <unk> assistant director for <unk> at the singapore institute of international affairs the haze of june two thousand and thirteen made the singaporean public much more involved in the issue
along with pm haze the episode <unk> the creation of the haze elimination action team another <unk> community group
both groups have since gone on site visits to indonesia opened <unk> with palm oil companies and offered feedback or <unk> to singaporean officials
such a ground up approach is very much welcomed by the government said <unk>
haze however is still a growing public health concern for many countries especially lower income ones
we put a lot of legislation in place to control point sources and still when you add it up <unk> conditions don't get better said <unk> <unk> chief scientist at the united nations environment program
other challenges she told me are linking air pollution data with research on <unk> and holding governments accountable for <unk> pollution laws
more than ever air pollution is a prominent target of policy reforms and public health <unk>
many lower income countries <unk> with the environmental and health consequences of their booming populations are <unk> air pollution standards
international aid and development agencies are also rolling out projects to monitor or <unk> <unk> emissions
in southeast asia haze has recently <unk> on <unk> political radar
in early july two thousand and fourteen officials from riau province announced that they would conduct a large scale <unk> <unk> of local officials and <unk> companies linked to peatlands
on august five singapore's parliament passed a law that allows the government to fine both domestic and international companies up to two million dollar singapore for causing or contributing to haze
and on sixteen september indonesia's parliament finally <unk> <unk> two thousand and two <unk> <unk> haze agreement after twelve years of resistance
also that summer a senior adviser to <unk> <unk> widodo then indonesia's president <unk> said the new administration planned to <unk> the two thousand and nine indonesian law that banned peat burning when it <unk> in two thousand and fifteen
widodo himself said he planned to <unk> land governance by creating a one map <unk> policy
the haze is caused both by the people and also the companies he told the straits times a singapore newspaper in late august
if we have good tough law enforcement then it can be resolved
how significant are these developments
in conversations with several haze watching analysts across south east asia i heard a wide range of opinions
some like <unk> <unk> aren't especially optimistic mainly because indonesia and <unk> have so far made so little progress on the haze problem
neither the singaporean law nor the regional haze agreement they pointed out would be <unk> in indonesian courts
and if climate change increases the number of <unk> and <unk> around the world as many scientists predict it will the <unk> of <unk> fires may also rise and pose additional enforcement challenges
but others said it is positive that the indonesian and singaporean governments are at least taking action the sort that could <unk> new life into existing indonesian laws designed to tackle haze
the recent political activity gives them hope that annual peat fires will not become southeast asia's status quo for future generations
<unk> did say that he aims to take action against the haze said tan <unk> <unk> the haze fighter
that's just words but it's better than nothing
no injuries were immediately reported

the philippines department of social welfare and development has confirmed that three hundred and forty members of one hundred homeless families were removed from roxas boulevard a major manila <unk> and temporarily <unk> to a beach resort about ninety kilometers away for the <unk> of the papal visit
the families returned after the pope's departure
a resolution before the philippines house of representatives has called on the government to <unk> the head of the <unk> for a probe into whether ninety seven thousand six hundred dollar spent on the six day training course at the resort in <unk> <unk> <unk> to a <unk> of public funds
rep. terry <unk> one of the lawmakers behind the resolution said in a statement he was concerned that the families had been <unk> up from roxas boulevard which the papal convoy traveled several times during the pope's january fifteen nineteen visit
he said the episode highlighted the <unk> manner in which the government implemented anti poverty programs
the training course at the resort had been been funded as part of a program with the objective of keeping families off the streets by training them how to live in a house read the resolution which was also sponsored by rep. <unk> <unk> and rep. <unk> <unk>
however after the papal visit the families who participated in the training were returned to the streets raising questions about the <unk> <unk> in terms of its supposed objective of reducing poverty said the resolution
in an unrelated senate hearing tuesday <unk> secretary <unk> <unk> was asked about the issue and confirmed that homeless families from the boulevard had been sent to the resort
she said the department had already intended to <unk> the families in the training program and had considered the period of the pope's visit would be the ideal time to do so
to prepare for pope francis arrival
local governments wanted to make sure that roxas boulevard was in a secure and safe state and so were the people
with the <unk> of people in the area she told the hearing
so when we reached out to the families on roxas boulevard since we were already planning to register them to the <unk> <unk> cash transfer program we thought it could be the right time to hold the orientation from january fifteen to nineteen
the government's <unk> <unk> cash transfer program is described on a government website as a complete package of assistance to street families
with access to social services and economic opportunities for the improvement of their living conditions
<unk> resolution alleged that the resort stay was not the first time that <unk> made an attempt to cover up the massive inequality in the country

at a news conference in mexico city tuesday <unk> <unk> said ninety nine suspects have been detained so far
authorities have also obtained hundreds of <unk> <unk> and pieces of evidence
these and other elements we found during the investigation allowed us to carry out an analysis about the <unk> causes and without a doubt we can <unk> that the students at the teachers college were abducted killed burned and thrown into the san juan river in that order <unk> <unk> said
as to why they were killed <unk> <unk> de <unk> the head of mexico's criminal investigations agency said it was a case of mistaken identity
in other words the criminal group accused of executing the students thought they belonged to a rival gang also operating around the town of iguala where the students were last seen
we can <unk> that the motivation was consistent the students were identified by the criminals as members of an organized crime rival group that operated in the region
that was the reason why they were deprived of their freedom initially and then of their lives <unk> de <unk> said
former iguala mayor jose luis <unk> has been charged in the case and is awaiting trial as the accused mastermind of the abduction and execution of the forty three students
authorities say he wanted to prevent the students from <unk> an event by his wife the night they went missing
the students were believed to have been captured by iguala police and turned over to a gang
there is no indication that <unk> wanted them all dead authorities said but the gang <unk> them for a rival group and executed them
<unk> wife maria de los angeles <unk> has also been charged
the case has caused an <unk> in mexico with countless protests and demonstrations which at times turned violent
at a news conference tuesday the parents of the students refused to believe authorities even suggesting the mexican military <unk> been behind the disappearance of the young men
the students attending a rural teachers college were left wing anti government activists mostly in their late teens and early <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> denied the army had anything to do with the case saying there weren't even enough soldiers in the area at the time of the disappearance to <unk> and <unk> forty three students
part of the problem is that so far the remains of only one student have been <unk> identified and parents are asking what happened to the other forty two
but the head of the criminal investigations agency says the remains were so badly burned that <unk> dna samples for identification is now impossible
the <unk> were thrown into the nearby san juan river
the <unk> remains found in what was the middle of the fire show that the temperature reached one thousand six hundred degrees celsius which <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> the remains
this makes it impossible to <unk> dna samples even with the most advanced technology <unk> de <unk> said

indonesia's search and rescue agency <unk> will continue its work to try to <unk> bodies from the wreckage site in the java sea the head of the agency bambang soelistyo said wednesday
the military provided the majority of personnel and <unk> involved in the recovery operation which was hindered by bad weather and technical problems
we are really disappointed imam <unk> whose four family members who were on the plane still haven't been found said of the military's announcement

but the attempts failed after lines attached to the wreckage broke
an effort to lift a smaller piece of wreckage was also unsuccessful the military said
our main priority is to find the bodies
we are not going to focus on <unk> the fuselage soelistyo said wednesday about the future search plans
the chief of the indonesian armed forces gen. <unk> on tuesday ordered the military teams involved in the operation to pull out said military spokesman <unk> <unk>
officials said that nineteen of the eighty one navy divers working on the recovery efforts had fallen ill with <unk> <unk> and would be taken for treatment at a hospital in jakarta the capital
i told them safety first
but as we know soldiers they are always working hard to find the bodies said rear <unk> widodo commander of the indonesian <unk> western fleet
they are not thinking about safety but about doing their duty
the divers haven't been able to see any more bodies inside the wreckage of the fuselage widodo said
officials had previously suggested that many of the missing human remains might be found inside the fuselage
but widodo said some bodies could be trapped or hidden under wreckage on the <unk>
searchers have recovered at least fourteen bodies from the fuselage site including some that <unk> free during attempts to lift the wreckage according to officials
indonesian aviation investigators are still trying to establish why flight qz eight thousand five hundred and one went down in an area of heavy thunderstorms last month while other planes nearby completed their journeys safely
investigators are looking at whether the aircraft's flight <unk> computers played a role in what went wrong the news agency reuters reported tuesday citing two unidentified people familiar with the matter
the <unk> helps pilots with the stability and control of the aircraft keeping it on course at the proper altitude and making sure <unk> to the <unk> are smooth
it also warns pilots if they try to <unk> push the plane beyond its capabilities
flight qz eight thousand five hundred and one an airbus a three hundred and twenty two hundred had two <unk> one serving as a <unk>
indonesian officials have said the aircraft climbed rapidly before it fell into the water
the reason for the sharp <unk> is unclear but aviation analysts say the <unk> could have recognized trouble and at a critical moment <unk> <unk> full control back to the pilots who may not have realized it amid the crisis
investigators have submitted their preliminary report into the crash officials said tuesday
but authorities have said they don't plan to release it to the public

after two years of fundraising and <unk> with government bureaucracy rodrigues arrived at a place some might call a version of <unk>
the <unk> <unk> reserve where the awa <unk> <unk>
i wanted to show the daily life in the world's most endangered tribe he said
the awa <unk> way of life is being threatened by relentless <unk> who are illegally <unk> on their land according to <unk> national indian foundation
many awa indians have had little to no contact with the outside world but that is beginning to change the foundation reports as <unk> continue to destroy the forests their existence depends on
rodrigues set out to document the <unk> existence pure <unk> and <unk> <unk>
i had traveled to africa and other remote places where people at least knew what a camera was rodrigues said
here i was in the twenty one st century with other humans who had never seen a camera a computer
never seen a <unk> and were shocked when they saw a helicopter
and yet they are extremely happy
calling themselves awa <unk> <unk> for man the tribe is made of forest <unk> and <unk> hunters
challenges <unk> said rodrigues who was forced to communicate with hand <unk> for several weeks because the <unk> did not speak <unk>
i pointed this way to say the sun is setting and made hand signs to ask questions about hunting rodrigues recalled
they were incredibly friendly and i was very well received
spending weeks without <unk> words rodrigues <unk> himself in the visual <unk> of the awa <unk> life in the forest
twelve hour hunting <unk> were common cutting through thick <unk> growth during the <unk> rains
<unk> <unk> sounds <unk> behind every moment something his photographs seem to <unk> to
<unk> from the use of formal <unk> often seen in <unk> rodrigues black and white photos are filled with an <unk> that could only come as a result of an <unk> <unk> with his subjects
the awa clearly <unk> rodrigues camera and in the resulting work we can clearly see how well <unk> he became with the <unk> and <unk> of the awa way of life
the <unk> quality of some of the shots in the hunting scenes is a testament to the <unk> <unk> and appreciation of a highly spiritual form of <unk>
we walked and walked for hours <unk> through the forest <unk> to look for the <unk> rodrigues said
the awa were <unk> the whole time
rodrigues <unk> talked about a dangerous situation while hunting for the indigenous red <unk>
the <unk> had missed a shot and the <unk> jumped right over towards me he said
in the meantime i was having an <unk> reaction to a <unk> bite
it wasn't easy
there are several groups of the awa <unk> in this part of the forest
some have been known to exist since the one thousand nine hundred and seventy s. others have been contacted in the early one thousand nine hundred and eighty s. many are believed to still be in hiding
earlier this month <unk> official news agency reported that three isolated awa indians had made contact with the other mainstream awa <unk>
the group's leader <unk> reportedly said that <unk> were marking trees and threatening to kill them
the brazilian government has launched a massive military operation into the states of <unk> and <unk> today the <unk> in the war between <unk> and indians
latest satellite imagery shows that new <unk> tracks are constantly being <unk>
monitoring and preserving such a large <unk> of tropical forest is a challenge
in the meantime how can the so called civilized world understand what is being lost
getting out of my comfort zone my comfortable bed to walk for hours through virgin forest crossing rivers and <unk> with water up to my neck
hearing the <unk> songs of the hunters as they walked home a large <unk> to share with their <unk> this experience can completely change a human being
but remaining relatively <unk> for all those years has had an <unk> effect on this two hundred and fifty kilometer long four kilometer wide no man's land
home to five rivers and several mountains it's become a thriving natural habitat for thousands of plant and animal species
and if south korea has its way the dmz will eventually be transformed into an <unk> peace park
the proposal is high on <unk> agenda at this week's <unk> convention an international meeting on <unk> taking place in switzerland
a korean delegation to the standing committee meeting of the <unk> convention will brief international organization officials about the dmz peace park plan to seek cooperation said an official of the ministry of <unk> the government office responsible for <unk> korean relations in a korea times report
it aims to <unk> international support for the project added the official
apart from the thousands of soldiers stationed at the dmz the heavily fortified border is home to more than one thousand two hundred <unk> of plants and thousands of animal species including endangered wildlife like the <unk> black bear and <unk> leopard
it's not the first time the idea to turn the dmz into an <unk> park has been raised
the south korean government first introduced the plan in two thousand and thirteen
it brought it up again in an official statement in two thousand and fourteen saying the park could become a symbol of peace between the two <unk>
the <unk> ministry of <unk> even listed it as one of its new year plans for two thousand and fourteen
so why <unk> the international <unk> assistance
as the southern part of dmz is under the control of the united nations command it is important for seoul to gain global support for the dmz park plan reports the korea times
but the biggest challenge will be to <unk> north korea to get on board with the plan
pyongyang has repeatedly rejected the idea <unk> it as an attempt to make money off tourists
the word on the street or on the internet at least is that plans are <unk> to develop an <unk> entertainment <unk> on the island's southwest coast national scenic area
after interest was <unk> by details posted on the region's official website however the page was quickly taken down
the park's administration director cheng <unk> <unk> confirmed with cnn that the proposal is real but he insists it's just a concept at this point
the ideal plan is to realize the proposal within this year if we can gain support from the local government said cheng
details of the plan circulated by a user on <unk> popular <unk> online bulletin board outlined a taiwan romantic boulevard <unk> route with four zones <unk> across three <unk>
each stage has a different theme
dating paradise scenic spot for wedding <unk> <unk> road of love and a proposed ten thousand meter square sex theme park
the sex theme park or garden of <unk> as it's called in the proposal will be <unk> after other <unk> parks around the world including <unk> <unk> in south korea and <unk> park in oslo norway
claiming to be educational the park will serve as the final stop of the four stage journey of love
it'll be divided into different sections covering topics including sex positions unusual sex lives and sex toys
the dating paradise is perfect for those who are more than friends but aren't officially a couple yet the proposal said
cheng said that the proposal shouldn't have been made public before being <unk> but insisted if realized that it will help <unk> a neglected area
the southwestern coast of taiwan has been an important salt farm since the <unk> dynasty he says
it has a unique background culture and <unk> value
yet a decade after it was declared a national scenic area it still hasn't received much attention from tourists
so we thought to ourselves is it time to try a new mode of thinking
the white <unk> salt hill and salt farm have always <unk> a romantic feeling for visitors coming to the area said cheng
that's why we came up with the idea to be the first dating wedding themed park in taiwan
this is the first time i find a government proposal interesting said one online critic according to <unk> now news
another said
we <unk> japan
the pride of taiwan
this is too out of line posted another
and soon the government will start promoting sex tourism
<unk> huang <unk> the deputy commissioner for <unk> county the sex park's proposed home told the <unk> times that the idea may not be <unk> for traditional <unk> locals
cheng said he'd received mostly supportive comments but he welcomed different opinions
sex has always been a <unk> in chinese society he added
but it's a part of our lives and a very natural thing why can't we discuss it openly and <unk>
aside from the sex park the rest of the proposal makes use of existing attractions
we're planning to add around one hundred <unk> and installations to each of stage to <unk> the experience said cheng
the proposed route starts at the scenic six story high salt hill in <unk> county
it then leads to <unk> a place famous for its vibrant pre wedding photo shooting industry where churches and dozens of other romantic <unk> are built for that purpose
the third destination <unk> is a fishing town in <unk>
the proposal calls it the right place to take your oath before heading to the sex theme park
the rush of fear and the brief re <unk> with breakfast are part of the <unk>
but when does a theme park ride stop being <unk> fun and start being just <unk> <unk>
we're talking about the rides on which the fear turns into the kind of pure psychological terror that only weeks of counseling or a night of <unk> can resolve
the rides on which it's not just breakfast that <unk> before your eyes but your entire life
these are the <unk> theme park rides on earth
<unk> we don't have to try them because <unk> zwanzger aka the <unk> theme park guy already has
and lived to tell the <unk>
just when life in a <unk> state couldn't get any more terrifying north korea <unk> some <unk> <unk> rides on its <unk> <unk>
to be fair the <unk> youth park is a rare attempt to <unk> genuine joy on the gray <unk> <unk> of pyongyang
the fear here says zwanzger is an emotional response in no way <unk> by <unk>
when you visit north korea you naturally never feel completely safe and relaxed so you enter the rides <unk> if they've been maintained at all since most were built decades ago
<unk> fear free alternative
<unk> has a relatively new italian made <unk> <unk>
most ghost trains are so lame that it's interesting to hear of one that actually does <unk> its passengers
unfortunately at the time of <unk> visit this <unk> ride on <unk> <unk> <unk> was getting its screams the <unk> way
via pain
imagine you're alone in a ghost train driving through the dark and all of a sudden a <unk> <unk> drops on you from above and <unk> itself to your nose and teeth zwanzger says
and while the ghost train keeps moving forward the <unk> and your nose and teeth don't
zwanzger says he complained to the operator
due to the language barrier and the lack of any internationally recognized sign language for my nose got stuck to a <unk> i don't think he got the message
i don't think he really <unk> about anything either
he adds
man that was painful
my love and <unk> goes out to those who ride it next
at iran's <unk> park it's a <unk> between which is more disturbing
the badly drawn <unk> <unk> cartoons or the <unk> can <unk> <unk>
for zwanzger the <unk> which plays fast and loose with physics by <unk> passengers in a such a tight loop they can almost see the backs of their own heads <unk>
when i saw this the first time with <unk> can shaped cars <unk> <unk> around a narrow loop i thought that's going to hurt
and it did
two to three hours of neck pain followed
this <unk> <unk> makes one of the <unk> <unk> known to <unk>
it's as if your head <unk> in the same place while the <unk> <unk> around
<unk> fear free alternative
<unk> <unk> iran's <unk> altogether and enjoy the country and its wonderful people
fill it with <unk> eyed <unk> and happy families
then <unk> the speed <unk> up to eleven
that's how they do it in nepal
because maybe when you live on the <unk> of the himalayas gaining a few extra meters in height just isn't <unk> enough
that thing had speed says zwanzger who says he didn't board the wheel in <unk> fun park because the line was too long and he was afraid of being <unk> into orbit
you could hear screams
and these were not the normal <unk> wheel screams of <unk> let's take a photo
these were more like <unk> let me down i <unk> <unk> get <unk> here screams
<unk> are called <unk> because as with chairs it's possible to sit in them and as with planes all <unk> says these things should not leave the ground
typically <unk> rise a few meters off the ground giving passengers a <unk> as they ride in a chair or model aircraft attached by chains to a <unk> overhead <unk>
at <unk> a new theme park in the chinese coastal city of <unk> the <unk> ride is less chair more plane <unk> <unk> passengers up to almost cruising altitude
i was the only <unk> and once up in the air the chains were making <unk> and <unk> <unk> and my chair was turning wildly on its own <unk> says zwanzger
it was a long ride
and cold
it was new so maybe my fear was just psychological but i'd rather fly a plane from the one thousand nine hundred and seventy s than get back in that <unk> <unk>
<unk> fear free alternative
any <unk> in a european theme park with a budget of more than one hundred million euros
there is of course nothing <unk> <unk> about a kid <unk> classic that takes passengers on a mini tour of a world populated by friendly <unk> <unk>
and yet says zwanzger <unk> it's a small world ride as seen in its u.s. french japanese and hong kong parks has <unk> potential as a psychological weapon
one ride is fun but try it about six or seven times and it becomes one of the <unk> rides on earth
you ask yourself what if i was trapped here listening to that song and seeing these <unk> forever
if you were to chain someone in this ride and have them go around over and over i think it would actually break them
like many <unk> things <unk> in the one thousand nine hundred and eighty s among them the <unk> <unk> and mid career films of <unk> <unk> the <unk> loop <unk> seemed like a good idea at the time
looking back however it's hard not to view it as the work of an <unk> mind
it enjoyed a brief life in the summer of one thousand nine hundred and eighty five at the now <unk> action park in <unk> new jersey before being shut down in one thousand nine hundred and ninety six reportedly after a series of accidents
i've been to almost three hundred theme and water parks now but this is by far the <unk> thing i've ever seen says zwanzger
looking at it it's just so obvious that if you have one wrong move you're going to experience a lot of pain or get trapped inside
i can't believe this was actually built in the united states the country where you can be <unk> by anyone for just about anything
that's my favorite part of the circus dutch photographer <unk> peels said
when there's a moment five minutes before get on and five minutes after they get off
peels <unk> with the circus began as a child
her father traveled europe as a one man show <unk> <unk> performing at hospitals and <unk> parks
at six years old peels began helping her father as the <unk> assistant
for five years she watched her father walk a <unk> between being her dad and performing as a <unk>
it's what the majority of peels work focuses on something she calls in between worlds
in two thousand and one peels traveled to india to follow and photograph a large ship
but instead she felt a calling to run away with the great <unk> circus
<unk> different from her father's small production the circus <unk> multiple tents and more than one hundred <unk>
she photographed the show for two weeks
at first she shot the expected the <unk> of the circus act
but it wasn't the <unk> on stage that truly appealed to peels <unk>
she became interested in the evolution that occurred behind the <unk>
her book <unk> <unk> together roughly one hundred photographs taken at several traveling <unk> in europe
the images capture a glimpse of the hidden life of the performing artist
the <unk> carry a certain <unk> when <unk> in and out of character
this is <unk> clearly in peels photo of a <unk>
he's still in <unk> his <unk> still intact yet he's off stage no longer part of an act
he <unk> an <unk> authenticity peels says
peels work is heavily influenced by other <unk> specifically nineteen th century paintings
before photographing every circus she visits local museums to <unk> inspiration
but the true genius lies in her ability to <unk> to the <unk>
she finds herself in between worlds too
there's the home life and the artist life peels says
as a wife and a mother of two peels says she struggles to find time to create and she often <unk> <unk> at artist <unk> to focus solely on her work
now she's in <unk> netherlands the <unk> of <unk> van <unk> in an effort to draw space to become a character of her own
i live in two worlds she said
so do you

nasa images released monday reveal the asteroid officially known as two thousand and four <unk> eighty six has its own small moon
the <unk> black and white photos show the asteroid about a third of a mile in size <unk> through space with its two hundred and thirty foot wide moon <unk> behind
asteroid two thousand and four <unk> eighty six came about seven hundred and forty five thousand miles from earth or about three times as far away as the moon just after eleven a.m
et monday according to nasa
it was far enough that it didn't pose a threat to earth but close enough to give scientists and <unk> a chance to observe a large asteroid up close
it was the closest known asteroid this large to pass near earth until two thousand and twenty seven when an asteroid called one thousand nine hundred and ninety nine an ten flies by
observers on the ground didn't see much when the asteroid was closest to earth monday morning because it wasn't at its <unk>
only a portion of its <unk> side was visible according to sky and telescope magazine
the asteroid <unk> as it got farther from the earth because its face became more fully <unk> the magazine said
the best chance for viewing was from eight p.m
et monday to one a.m
et tuesday
nasa scientists snapped radar generated images of the asteroid using the deep space network <unk> at <unk> california and the <unk> observatory in <unk> <unk>
while it poses no threat to earth for the foreseeable future it's a relatively close approach by a relatively large asteroid so it provides us a unique opportunity to observe and learn more <unk> <unk> the recently retired manager of nasa's near earth object program office at the jet <unk> laboratory in <unk> california said in a nasa news release
<unk> retired on january nine after sixteen years of tracking <unk>
paul <unk> has been designated as the new manager
we should be getting some great radar images of this asteroid <unk> told cnn before the asteroid passed
radar would be the key to study the <unk> surface give an idea of its shape whether it has rocks and that kind of stuff on it
it'll be really exciting
observers without <unk> or a <unk> watched from their computers on the virtual telescope project two point zero
the asteroid was discovered on january thirty two thousand and four by a telescope of the <unk> near earth asteroid research survey in white <unk> new mexico

it is the second purported message from goto in four days
if authentic it is the first time isis is publicly linking the <unk> of goto and the captive jordanian pilot moaz al kassasbeh whom isis captured after his jet crashed last month in syria
the latest file posted to youtube and distributed on social media by known isis supporters appears to show a <unk> image of goto alone in <unk> and wearing orange holding a picture of who appears to be al kassasbeh
over the image a voice purporting to be goto's <unk> saturday's apparent isis proposal
goto would go free if jordan releases longtime prisoner sajida al rishawi
this time it's still a one for one swap but now both the lives of goto and the jordanian pilot are threatened if it doesn't go through
cnn can not independently verify the authenticity of tuesday's message
i've been told this is my last message and i've also been told that the barrier <unk> my freedom is now just the jordanian government <unk> the <unk> of sajida the voice says in english in tuesday's post
tell the japanese government to put all the political pressure on jordan
her for me a straight exchange the voice says
any more delays by the jordanian government will mean they are responsible for the death of their pilot which will then be followed by mine
i only have twenty four hours left to live and the pilot has even less
the nearly two minute video posted tuesday morning et makes no mention of <unk> pilot al kassasbeh even if al rishawi is released
the video is similar to a post from saturday which alleged that isis had killed a different japanese hostage haruna yukawa
saturday's post shows a <unk> image of goto holding what appears to be a photo of beheaded <unk> <unk>
a voice purporting to be goto's says that yukawa was killed because japan hadn't answered a previous isis demand of two hundred million dollar for the japanese captives freedom
saturday's voice also said that the captors no longer demanded money but rather a goto for al rishawi swap
japanese prime minister shinzo abe said sunday that experts were analyzing saturday's video but that it seemed highly credible
u.s. authorities said they had no reason to doubt its authenticity
abe on wednesday morning told reporters in tokyo that he was angry about the ongoing situation
under very severe circumstances i <unk> yet again that the government work together as one towards the immediate release of mr. goto he said
al rishawi is an iraqi woman facing the death penalty in jordan for her role in a series of bombings that killed dozens of people at hotels in the arab kingdom in two thousand and five
authorities said she tried to take part in the massacre but her explosives failed
militants say they captured al kassasbeh the jordanian pilot after he ejected from his <unk> f sixteen last month having taken part in u.s. led coalition airstrikes near isis de facto capital raqqa syria
jordan is participating in an american led mission against isis an organization seeking to establish a caliphate or islamic state and has <unk> territory spanning from central syria to about one hundred kilometers north of baghdad
goto forty seven and yukawa forty two had gone to the middle east for different reasons the former is an experienced freelance journalist covering the conflict in iraq and syria and the latter an aspiring security contractor who felt at home in the war torn region
they ended up in the hands of isis in recent months
the thirty one year old lee <unk> shows off her winning display telling visitors how much fun she had making the bag with her partner a local design college student
the hardest part was <unk> the bottle <unk> on she said
i <unk> different types of bags
sometimes you need a bigger bag if you want to put more things inside
walk around the room and the exhibition is full of <unk> items wine boxes <unk> covers and <unk> now <unk> as pen <unk> <unk> and <unk>
in a sense lee and the fifteen or so people involved with the project have been neglected in one way or another by hong kong society all of these people have struggled to get by because they all have <unk> disabilities
despite the pride she has for her daughter <unk> mother worries about her
her character is too simple and warm
i'm worried she will get hurt and sometimes she has to be <unk> about what she says
people living with down syndrome are often stuck with <unk> jobs
but this exhibition run by the local <unk> army gave lee and others the chance to learn a new skill partner with a local student to <unk> trash into treasure all in an effort to raise <unk> awareness
in chinese <unk> people with disabilities have been associated with bad luck that the <unk> was a punishment for the <unk> of an <unk>
many lived in hiding <unk> discrimination and <unk> advocates say
but increasingly people are finding ways to counter <unk> and bring people with disabilities into the mainstream
it's an experience that <unk> hui a social work professor at the university of hong kong and mother of a daughter with down syndrome knows well
hui explains that traditionally disabled people are seen as an <unk> something that is no good
there is a chinese saying that it must be the family who is doing something wrong
in the older days they were saying that it's a kind of punishment
hui recalled that when she and other parents of children opened their first center for the down syndrome association more than twenty years ago the windows were broken and they couldn't use the elevator because neighbors didn't want them there
the group responded by holding workshops with residents to explain and <unk> <unk> about down syndrome
a few years later the group was finally allowed to use the elevator and the workshops no longer became necessary
although information about <unk> is now widely available some of that stigma exists today
<unk> anderson is a fifteen year old with <unk> <unk> who requires round the clock care
she can't move but she can see and hear
she often has to deal with strangers talking about her in front of her
her mother kim anderson originally from britain said
the difficult thing with <unk> is that if she is in company and people are talking about her she's understanding everything they're saying
to combat this problem she made a sign in english and chinese telling people she can see and hear
for anderson the key to change in attitudes is integration
that's maybe what we're still not doing enough of in hong kong maybe in schools and getting people like <unk>
out and about in society because until they're in society society is not going to fully understand or appreciate them
the <unk> department estimates that about ten percents of the city's population has physical or <unk> disabilities based on on figures from two thousand and fourteen
at another photo exhibition featuring people with disabilities <unk> lee a nineteen year old with down syndrome strikes a <unk> pose in his green belt
his father peter lee said he believes attitudes are changing
more and more people with disabled child or children the parents will take them outside to encounter the whole world let them learn let them go to school and not just hide the disabled child or children in hong kong
nowadays more and more parents love or like to do that
<unk> freeman photographed lee and other young people with down syndrome as models for his exhibition entitled the <unk> people
he photographed young people showing off their <unk> such as acting dancing and swimming
there have been efforts around the globe to be more <unk> of people with down syndrome including target <unk> in the united states featuring child models and a tv ad by british department store marks and <unk>
two years ago freeman started <unk> with the down syndrome association and realized part of the problem was that people didn't know how to talk to those with the condition and that they were often treated as patients instead of people
he said that the aim of the exhibition was to show a more <unk> side of people with down syndrome
they just want to love and be involved in making people happy he said
a british transport minister on a trade visit to <unk> got an <unk> lesson in the <unk> of diplomatic gift giving monday when she presented a pocket watch to the city's mayor a <unk> act in chinese culture

he has made the <unk> an <unk> visit with the people a <unk> of his political brand
<unk> is go to the people go to the ground he told amanpour as he walked his <unk> through crowds in central jakarta
we check our program we <unk> our program and we must know the real situation the ground
to the <unk> of his <unk> stress levels he makes these visits at least once a week
it is a rare sight for any world leader let alone one who leads a country with a history of violent separatist movements
his security team allows the president to be <unk> by young and old <unk> in for a <unk>
later at a slum that he's transformed into new low cost housing an elderly woman walks right up to the president
she asked my number telephone number
he says
things are getting a little too friendly says amanpour with a smile
widodo was raised in a down and out area of the central java city of <unk> known as solo
his father was a <unk> and he followed in his <unk> becoming a <unk> <unk>
his rise to power was unusual he has no history with the military or the elite unlike the country's former presidents
he rose to <unk> through his extremely popular <unk> as mayor of solo and then governor of jakarta
his musical <unk> too are unusual for a head of state
as heavy metal <unk> through his <unk> <unk> widodo slapped his <unk> in <unk> with the song and told amanpour that some of his favorite <unk> include led <unk> and <unk>
amanpour raised his <unk> as they stood overlooking the former slum
i know the situation
i know the condition he says
because when i was little when i was a boy i stayed the <unk> in the slum area
in southeast asia's largest garment market narrow <unk> lined with <unk> become <unk> as seemingly everyone in the <unk> lit building <unk> in for a chance to see <unk>
he stops to buy twenty <unk> for gifts in the office he says from a <unk> who struggles to contain his <unk> excitement
indonesia has had trouble breaking into the global marketplace that has transformed many of its asian neighbors like china
indonesia is a big country
and i want my people prosperous he says
it's not easy but i want it
his challenges are many
indonesia's gross domestic product growth has been <unk>
shortly after widodo took office the world bank said the country's growth rate was the lowest it had been for five years
i am sure that with <unk> changes that we have <unk> by and dealing with infrastructure and providing opportunity for investment whether local or foreign <unk> i am sure that we will grow better this year between
if conditions are right within three years he says gdp growth could be more than seven percents
but we have to work hard he says
in his first one hundred days widodo did something his <unk> have tried and failed to <unk>
a cut in the enormous fuel <unk> the government offers
in the late one thousand nine hundred and ninety s protests over fuel prices <unk> an uprising that led to the resignation of the dictator <unk>
with the cut in fuel <unk> the savings to government has been around two hundred and thirty trillion <unk> widodo says promising more for his infrastructure health and education plans
his vision is to <unk> the use of government money to promote <unk> of fossil fuels and instead use funds to bolster the country's desperately <unk> health and education systems and infrastructure
to build our infrastructure
to improve the <unk> for the farmer <unk> and <unk> to the farmer
and then we give to the <unk> we give <unk> to the <unk>
and we give working capital to small in the villages
so from the <unk> to the production
from the <unk> activities to the productive activities
two months after taking office airasia flight qz eight thousand five hundred and one crashed in indonesian waters with one hundred and sixty two people on board
i don't know why the plane went down the president told amanpour
it can be because of the weather it can be because of other reasons
we are not sure about that now
but the most important thing is that the operation was conducted quickly and we are continuing the removal of bodies from the ocean floor
a preliminary report is due out this week
last week the country's transportation minister said the plane had climbed rapidly and stalled before it crashed into the sea
airasia is a malaysian carrier but indonesia has long had a troubled airline industry and <unk> system
so dangerous is the country's industry that only five indonesia airlines are <unk> to fly within the european union more than sixty others are banned as of november
what we want to fix is the system
we are going to fix this he says
but the of system administration is not related to the airline accidents
airasia flight qz eight thousand five hundred and one was not <unk> to fly its route from surabaya indonesia to singapore on the day it took off
there is no relation he insisted between the <unk> system and the crash
as the world's largest muslim majority nation and democracy indonesia is often held up as a <unk> of <unk>
since the killings of seventeen people in france this month the world has turned its focus to radical islam in a greater way perhaps than any time since nine eleven
the world in some way is looking to this country among others to hold the line
most of the world's muslims are not arab and indonesia is a case in point
there is no compromise for violence
no compromise
and we really condemn that
but we also need to respect each other respect other religions among people between individuals we have to respect each other widodo says
differences can be a beauty
it's not going to be something that's <unk>
the country has had its <unk> with violent <unk> a two thousand and two al qaeda affiliated attack in bali that left two hundred and two dead and a long running but now <unk> islamic separatist movement in <unk>
between two hundred and fifty and three hundred <unk> have gone to fight with isis and other extremist groups in syria widodo says
the number is really small he points out for a population with a quarter billion people
we have a good experience in handling <unk> and extremism through not only security approach but also cultural and religious approach
in indonesia we have big moderate islamic organizations widodo says
those organizations are the ones who teach moderate islam islam that has got good tolerance toward any other religions
and thanks be to god that in indonesia at present this process going well
the security approach doesn't solve the problem will not solve the problem
but religious approach cultural approach going to <unk> a lot
some analysts worry that radical islamist organizations in indonesia may <unk> the training ground syria has provided
there are some people who went using fake or <unk> passports but they arrested in our airports widodo says
we want indonesia to be an example of moderate islam islam that has tolerance good islam
and i am sure that we are able to do so
in indonesia islam and democracy can go together
indonesia can be a land of ruthless politics
three months into his term widodo was facing his first big administrative crisis
his choice for police chief <unk> <unk> was a favorite of the head of his political party and <unk> former president <unk> <unk>
days after widodo announced the nomination <unk> was indicted by the country's anti corruption commission
in apparent retaliation police arrested the deputy chief of the country's anti corruption body
these events have rocked and <unk> the country the subject of protests and daily page one newspaper stories
our commitment still is to <unk> corruption widodo tells amanpour through an interpreter
and we have to also use the <unk> of innocence principle
because of the corruption investigation he says <unk> <unk> as chief despite overwhelming approval of parliament has been delayed
everybody has to be <unk> in looking at it as a legal process and the president is not allowed to <unk>
this is a legal process
the rise of a <unk> politician may have given hope to those who wanted a <unk> president but <unk> approach to drug smugglers on death row has been cold comfort
in december he announced that he would reject clemency requests for sixty four inmates sentenced to die
six prisoners were killed by firing squad this month including five foreigners
brazil and the netherlands <unk> their <unk> in protest
two australians are due to face the firing squad
widodo rejected their requests for clemency as well over appeals from the australian prime minister
imagine every day we have fifty people die because of <unk> of drugs
in one year it's eighteen thousand people who die because of <unk>
we are not going to compromise for drug <unk>
no compromise
no compromise he says
the decision of death penalty is on the court
but they can ask for amnesty to the president
but i tell you there will be no amnesty for drug <unk>
so no relief amanpour asked for the australians due to die
no the president shook his head
eighteen thousand people die every year
i ask you is it not more dangerous
in a <unk> statement litvinenko blamed russian president vladimir putin for ordering his <unk> by tea at a london hotel
the kremlin has always strongly denied the <unk>
sir robert owen who's chairman of the inquiry said tuesday that sensitive material relating to possible russian state involvement in litvinenko's death would be heard behind closed doors
the british government initially rejected requests to hold a public inquiry but the decision was <unk> last summer after litvinenko's widow <unk> litvinenko challenged it in court
she argued that a public inquiry would enable the <unk> possible investigation
an inquest a <unk> led investigation that is held as a matter of course in the case of <unk> deaths in england had been opened after her husband's death
but unlike a public inquiry it can not hear evidence behind closed doors
in alexander litvinenko's case such evidence could involve matters of national security
the issues to which his death gives rise are of the utmost <unk> and have attracted worldwide interest and concern owen said
litvinenko a former <unk> agent and fierce critic of putin came to britain in two thousand after turning <unk> <unk> on the <unk> the <unk> successor
he died at a london hospital on november twenty three two thousand and six after being <unk> by the <unk> material <unk> two hundred and ten while drinking tea at the millennium hotel in london's <unk> square
uk prosecutors have asked for the extradition of two men <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> from russia in connection with litvinenko's murder
but moscow has refused saying russia's constitution does not allow the extradition of russian citizens
both men deny involvement in litvinenko's death
owen said that <unk> and <unk> had been invited to give evidence to the inquiry by video link from russia and that he hoped they would do so
the public inquiry will look at possible russian state involvement in litvinenko's death
however it will not address the question as to whether the uk government could or should have taken steps to prevent the murder
litvinenko is said by his widow to have been a british agent with a <unk> at <unk> six britain's foreign security service
in two thousand and twelve the <unk> to the inquest <unk> <unk> said evidence provided by the uk government showed russian involvement and does establish a <unk> <unk> case as to the <unk> of the russian state in the death of alexander litvinenko
the inquest has been put on hold while the public inquiry is held
owen the <unk> in the inquest said the open <unk> in the inquiry should <unk> before <unk>
that is early april
more than seventy witnesses are due to be called over the coming weeks including family and friends of litvinenko those who worked with him before his death medical staff who treated him after he fell ill and the pathologists who conducted his autopsy the court heard
the pathologists will testify wednesday on the <unk> results
the presence of radiation in litvinenko's body complicated the autopsy the inquiry heard
a nuclear scientist will also give evidence wednesday about <unk> two hundred and ten its <unk> where it can be found and what effect it has on the body once <unk>
in the course of the inquiry evidence may also deal with the <unk> risk posed to the wider public by the transfer of such highly <unk> material
owen said <unk> could have been used to kill large numbers of people or spread general <unk> and <unk> among the public
u.s. president barack obama became the first american chief guest at the parade
not only did he have to endure two hours of a cold delhi morning <unk> <unk> in a glass box he also may have noticed how much of india's military <unk> was of russian and not american <unk>
but most indians will focus on the fact that obama is the first sitting american president to visit india twice
they will remember the many images of obama and prime minister narendra modi shaking hands and <unk> a warm embrace on the airport <unk> and at their first joint press conference in the world's <unk>
the indian media has dubbed it a <unk> evidence of the <unk> that aides on both sides have been at <unk> to point out for months
it seems like an <unk> since the former leader of the indian state of <unk> was <unk> non <unk> in the u.s
and so the biggest <unk> from obama's three days in india was the <unk> of the leaders of the world's two biggest <unk> <unk> up
but others would have seen greater geopolitical implications
as obama watched the republic day parade beijing welcomed pakistan's army chief general <unk> sharif for talks
unlike obama's previous india visit in two thousand and ten pakistan was not a focus at least in public statements
instead india seems to be <unk> itself for a more global role playing a part in issues that go beyond its borders
there were some other tangible <unk> from the summit too though the exact details were a little <unk>
modi announced progress had been made on negotiations over a civil nuclear deal a new ten year defense cooperation agreement between the two countries was announced which may have far reaching consequences for both sides on sharing intelligence and military education and there was much talk about boosting bilateral trade from its current level of around one hundred billion dollar a year to five hundred billion dollar by two thousand and twenty five
as with most <unk> between world leaders what goes on behind the scenes before and after is probably more important at least in terms of detail
but let's give <unk> its moment and its due
for millions of indians who watched the events of the last three days and given the intense media coverage in india it would have been impossible to miss they will now slowly <unk> their sense of india's place in the world
maybe that will help <unk> india's historically <unk> foreign policy thinking
maybe it will make india a more prominent player in global issues over time
and maybe just maybe india and the u.s. may move a little closer to forming the defining partnership that obama first promised in two thousand and ten

sajida al rishawi was sentenced to death for that attempt and jordan executed her early wednesday
isis had demanded her release threatening to kill two hostages if jordan didn't <unk>
isis carried out those killings and jordan carried out al <unk> execution
but just who was she
and what's her connection to the new radical sunni group that controls big swaths of syria and iraq
al rishawi was referred to as an imprisoned sister of the terrorist group in a message purportedly posted online by a known isis supporter
the message proposed a swap of al rishawi for japanese hostage kenji goto
in the video goto was seen holding a photo of what appeared to be beheaded <unk> haruna yukawa
the online posts which cnn could not verify independently appeared four days after an isis video demanded that the japanese government pay two hundred million dollar within seventy two hours for the hostages release
in the latest recording the voice of a person claiming to be goto was heard in english blaming japanese prime minister shinzo abe for yukawa's death
<unk> the money the voice then issued a new isis demand
the release of al rishawi
they are just demanding the release of their imprisoned sister sajida al rishawi the voice said
al rishawi who was being held by authorities in jordan was not seen publicly in nine years
in a televised confession in november two thousand and five al rishawi calmly recounted how she tried to take part in a string of terror attacks at jordanian hotels that month that killed at least fifty seven people
my husband detonated his bomb and i tried to <unk> mine but failed al rishawi said on jordanian television showing no <unk>
people fled running and i left running with them

austerity
read
<unk> vote in election that could lead to <unk> over bailout
greece was among the nations hardest hit by the global financial crisis
a deeply troubled economy widespread unemployment and civil unrest meant that back in two thousand and ten the country was <unk> on the brink of exit from the euro <unk> the sick man of europe
but the <unk> handed down by the <unk> the international monetary fund european commission and european central bank was always going to be difficult to <unk>
tax <unk> a <unk> on state <unk> bans on early retirement and deep cuts in government <unk> in return for a two hundred and forty billion bailout
five years on and the greek economy is starting to recover
last year it came out of <unk>
this year the country's gdp is expected to grow zero point seven percents
but some fear the years spent locked in a <unk> of debt and <unk> may have done more harm than good
there is widespread unemployment with twenty seven percents of the population out of work industrial production has <unk> thirty percents and three million people live on or below the poverty line
for many here austerity has only led to <unk> and caused <unk> <unk> that are visible on faces across the city
over instant coffee at his house on the outskirts of athens <unk> fifty eight says his world has been turned <unk> down since losing his job in two thousand and nine
he has been unemployed ever since
i used to have money in my pocket and now i have nothing he explains
i was supposed to get my <unk> next year and now that has been pushed back by two years
just put yourself in my position
the initial frustration he felt has turned to anger
his pride has also been battered
to get by he has had to ask his mother to share her <unk> not easy for a man who had always been the <unk>
now he and his four grown up sons depend on his wife <unk>
but her wages which have been <unk> by fifty five percents are not enough to feed everyone leaving her with a tough decision
help the family or pay taxes
who to help first
they are four
i don't buy anything for myself so that i can help them
i had to pay two hundred and sixty in taxes and i only earn eight hundred
so i haven't paid the taxes and gave the money to my son to help him with his rent she explains
the family's desperation has only been exacerbated by their <unk> with politicians and their policies
since two thousand and five greece has had six prime ministers each one <unk> to bring an end to the crisis
each one promising jobs and growth
but nothing <unk> says has changed
so he and his wife are gambling on greece's left wing syriza party their pledge to bring an end to austerity and their message that hope is coming
angry and frustrated <unk> insists
things can't get any worse with a new government
and if they do we'll vote again for someone else
have politicians ever asked an unemployed citizen when he <unk> up in the morning and who has a family if this person has a single euro or five in his pocket to buy a <unk> of milk to feed his children
he asks
i don't trust any of them
for now <unk> and <unk> are placing their trust in syriza and its leader <unk> tsipras who has promised to raise the minimum wage re <unk> public sector workers reduce taxes and tackle the country's silent humanitarian crisis
but <unk> <unk> pledge and the one that is making the rest of europe nervous is his promise to <unk> the terms of the greek bailout deal
at syriza's last rally before sunday's general election i asked the party's finance spokesman george <unk> what they will do if they can't see eye to eye with europe
what we are arguing for with our european partners is a new <unk> that will remove part of the public debt burden on the greek economy and at the same time allow greece to get back to work he says
in other words they want to stay in the single currency but with more <unk> <unk> a <unk> space of sorts so the country can recover from its economic <unk> and begin to grow again
both working class and middle class voters and both public and private sector workers have voiced support for this call
computer <unk> <unk> <unk> says he has always voted for the conservatives but having seen his wages <unk> and his taxes increase and as the father of a newborn baby he's <unk> for change this time around
syriza doesn't express one hundred percents my opinions and i'm not level with what they believe and what they want to do but i believe its something new a new party with fresh ideas that is going to change what is already <unk> he explains
there is no doubt that anger and austerity have fueled the rise of syriza in a country whose citizens are calling for social and economic change
but if he is elected the question of whether tsipras can make a difference to greece will depend on what he does with his power and how the eu and its leaders deal with him
whatever the outcome of sunday's polls the hard work it seems is just beginning
what does this victory mean for greece and for the debt ridden countries of southern europe
for greece this is a decisive step in the <unk> of <unk> and new democracy the parties that have been in power for forty years
<unk> it shows the failure of the political strategy pursued by the <unk> to implement austerity in southern europe by relying on centrist parties to form a <unk> that is <unk> from voters
austerity is of course the main culprit for the death of traditional politics in greece
this is mainly because it has <unk> the system of mass party <unk> on which the two traditional big parties on the center left and center right have relied on to <unk> in power
read more
what's next for greece
for four decades politicians from both parties built their <unk> success on the distribution of political <unk> in exchange for votes
public sector jobs infrastructure projects protection from competitors through <unk> and closed shops and social benefits targeted at particular occupations among other <unk> and benefits benefiting party supporters
pork barrel politics as it is known has long been the <unk> of greek politics and also one of the causes of the deep economic problems it is facing now
this <unk> <unk> system was able to survive at the cost of high inflation and currency <unk> or <unk> public debt
but when the interest rates on government <unk> shot up and debt could no longer be used to finance the <unk> system greece was taken to the brink of <unk>
when the <unk> imposed a <unk> program of austerity and <unk> <unk> and new democracy were deprived of the very tools they had relied on for so long to stay in power
turning off the tap of public spending was like <unk> their own <unk>
voters and their traditional <unk> abandoned them because they had no real ideological program other than running the state
this problem was particularly brutal for <unk> which collapsed from nearly forty percents support before the crisis to four percents today
this opened up room for new <unk> on the left promising a <unk> with the old <unk> but also on the far right
the victory of syriza also signals the broader failure of the political strategy that has been employed to implement austerity in the debt ridden countries of southern europe a strategy best described as <unk> politics
<unk> politics involves the <unk> of political <unk> between the ruling centrist parties to implement austerity
just as competing <unk> sometimes agree to fix prices or production levels competing political parties agree to put their ideological differences aside to <unk> to power together in spite of the huge <unk> of the policies they put in place
this is essentially what happened in greece with the <unk> new democracy government but also in italy with the <unk> cabinet of mario <unk> or the grand coalition of <unk> <unk> which united the center left democratic party and <unk> <unk> right wing <unk>
in <unk> another country in dire economic conditions the <unk> minority government of jos <unk> also benefited from the <unk> support of its main center right <unk> to carry out austerity measures and avoid a bailout
in spain the <unk> rise of the left wing <unk> party can also be explained by the lack of <unk> of center left and center right policies before and after the crisis even if it never <unk> in a de facto coalition
forming political <unk> is <unk> in a context where any party in office is bound to have to pass <unk> policies imposed by <unk> that will cost votes and <unk> a <unk> share of the <unk>
it is a good way to stay in office in the short term but it is a terrible way to keep votes in the medium and long term because no choice is presented to citizens
whoever they vote for the policies will be the same and they will be painful
<unk> and <unk> <unk> and voters become attracted to <unk> promising an alternative
as the <unk> base of centrist parties <unk> the only way for them to remain in power is to band together to <unk> for the loss of voters until this <unk> base becomes too small to stay in government
syriza is the first challenger to break the greek political <unk>
greece may be a special case because of the extent of its economic collapse but other movements elsewhere are also <unk> on the <unk>
in spain <unk> has been leading the polls in spite of the fact that it was created less than a year ago
in italy <unk> <unk> five star movement has made a breakthrough in the last european elections
others will surge if politicians continue to believe that democracy can be put on hold to <unk> markets
<unk> and <unk> mubarak had served the maximum <unk> detention allowed
a previous <unk> conviction of the two sons and their father was overturned this year but they all face a retrial on the <unk> charges
the <unk> and four new defendants are accused of <unk> seventeen point nine million dollar allocated for the <unk> of presidential <unk>
mubarak was sentenced last year to three years in prison
his sons to four years each
they have maintained their innocence
the <unk> appealed saying their sentences were too harsh
mubarak ruled egypt as president for twenty nine years before he was ousted during the arab spring protests
in another case he was convicted in two thousand and twelve of <unk> orders to kill peaceful protesters during the country's two thousand and eleven uprising and was sentenced to life in prison
he appealed and was granted a new trial last year
in november he was cleared of those charges and of corruption
that's the big question on the mind of indonesia's transportation minister as investigators finish preparing the initial report into the crash last month of the airbus a three hundred and twenty two hundred with one hundred and sixty two passengers on board
the question is why this plane suddenly climbed from thirty two thousand feet to almost thirty eight thousand feet without any information and any warning <unk> jonan told cnn in an interview monday
jonan said none of the other planes in the area experienced the turbulent weather patterns that led the pilot of qz eight thousand five hundred and one to request a change of course and an increase in altitude shortly before it disappeared off radar
data provided by the indonesian transportation ministry shows that less than three minutes after making that request flight qz eight thousand five hundred and one began climbing sharply rising nearly six thousand feet in less than a minute
the plane then fell rapidly and disappeared off radar in the middle of the java sea
that sequence of events is based on radar and <unk> information not on the contents of the plane's flight data recorder
the analysis of the information from the data recorder and the other so called black box the cockpit voice recorder is expected to be part of the preliminary report that indonesia is due to submit to international air safety <unk> by january twenty eight
the transportation minister told cnn that he wants to ensure the victims families and the public are kept informed and that there's nothing hidden from them
but when asked if that meant he would release the preliminary report to the public he said no
jonan said he will urge investigators to release the final report as soon as possible
it won't be a year that's my promise he said
jonan <unk> an investigation into why flight qz eight thousand five hundred and one was able to take off on a sunday even though airasia <unk> permission to fly from surabaya to singapore on that day of the week
his inquiry discovered sixty other flights had been running without proper <unk>
those flights have been banned he says and ministry officials are now regularly checking the <unk>
while he calls the issue of flights operating without permission a big worry he says he believes it was unrelated to the crash of flight qz eight thousand five hundred and one
he also says he thinks that this crash should not be seen as a permanent black mark against indonesia's safety record
we run around one thousand flights a day and seven thousand flights a week jonan said
and that's a lot of flights in the air of indonesia
so one crashed unfortunately
so i would suggest it's not a big issue that can make everybody not fly in the air of indonesia
the leader of the left wing syriza party <unk> tsipras was sworn in as greece's new prime minister on monday after forming a coalition with the right wing independent <unk> party
tsipras has vowed to end austerity measures and <unk> the terms of greece's european union bailout
since two thousand and ten greece has received <unk> <unk> two hundred and forty billion euros
in return the international monetary fund european commission and european central bank demanded tax <unk> a <unk> on state <unk> bans on early retirement and deep cuts in government <unk>
syriza's <unk> to try to get some of greece's <unk> debt written off and <unk> back <unk> austerity measures appealed to <unk> members of the <unk> even if they potentially <unk> greece's place in the <unk>
the party's victory could lead to a dramatic <unk> with the debt laden nation's <unk>
syriza's message is one that has also <unk> in other southern european countries under the restrictions of international <unk>
its victory could boost other <unk> parties such as <unk> <unk> anti euro five star movement in italy and the <unk> movement in spain
declaring victory for syriza on sunday after polls showed it winning at least one hundred and forty nine seats in the three hundred seat parliament tsipras forty appeared to <unk> for a bigger battle
we are <unk> our lost dignity
now that we are heard by all of europe we will fight with the same passion the same confidence he told <unk> supporters
so let's go and let's all continue this beautiful and tough fight he said
greece leaves behind the austerity that <unk> it leaves behind the fear leaves behind five years of <unk> and greece moves forward with optimism and hope and dignity he told the crowd
european central bank executive board member <unk> <unk> told cnn on monday that greece would still have to pay its debt
they have to pay
those are the european rules of the game
there is no room for <unk> action in europe that doesn't <unk> a discussion for example on the <unk> of this debt
but i would like to <unk> that it's not the <unk> money it's the governments money
it's a discussion between mr. tsipras and the european governments
chief eu commission spokesman <unk> <unk> said it respected the <unk> choice of the greek people
we are ready to engage with the new government once it is formed
greece has made remarkable progress in recent years and we stand ready to continue to assist greece in addressing the remaining reform challenges he said
the austerity imposed by greece's international <unk> has cut deep
unemployment has <unk> to twenty eight percents and many people who still have jobs have seen <unk> <unk> in wages <unk> frozen and the retirement age pushed back
the governing new democracy party had pointed to recent improvements in economic <unk> as signs that things were getting better
after <unk> defeat sunday <unk> prime minister <unk> <unk> said his conscience was clear
i got a country on the <unk> of ruin
i was asked to try and save it and i did it he said
most people did not believe we could stand strong but we did
now he said greece is secure and slowly walking away from the crisis
and more than anything he said i give back a country that is a member of the european parliament and the euro
on monday the ceo of one of greece's largest banks <unk> said syriza was coming to power at a fortunate time
the tide is changing in europe the <unk> is improving in greece the european central bank is launching an unprecedented <unk> and that will have a significant bearing on the fortunes of greece going forward <unk> <unk> said
greece has already gone through massive <unk> much of the hard work has already been completed the green shoots of recovery are already there so this is a great opportunity for greece a great opportunity for a new government
in his victory speech sunday tsipras noted that greece's election could have an impact far beyond his country's borders
our victory is at the same time it's a victory for all the people of europe that are fighting against austerity that's <unk> the common european future he said
but it's unclear how syriza's plans to <unk> the bailout would play out
is <unk> tsipras man of the moment
<unk> is the most simple and <unk> gesture it <unk> a punch <unk> said of his decision to have his models bare all
it's powerful
who else can really get away with this stuff
it's a corporate world
the looks were simply for shock and awe and the attention such reactions generate after all they can't be worn out in public and won't be sold in stores
but let's be honest
were we even shocked
after all female models have been asked to <unk> down <unk> in states of near <unk> for years
meanwhile more and more films are featuring full <unk> male <unk>
there was michael <unk> in shame of course
and who can forget the <unk> over the <unk> of ben <unk> <unk> in gone girl <unk> so brief one had to know the precise moment to look for it
and if we've seen ben <unk> <unk> who cares about some male <unk>
of course women have been going full <unk> in films for years
perhaps the onslaught of <unk> is a sign that public <unk> is becoming an equal opportunity endeavor
that women are no longer required to do all the showing
that's not a bad thing
maybe the free the <unk> people are finally getting their way and women will be able to parade <unk> around town or at the <unk> or wherever they please without <unk> or stigma as men have done for ages
more likely it's a clear sign that we're a culture so <unk> that we've got no other choice but to up the stakes at every turn
we are becoming have become <unk> to that which was previously surprising <unk> awe inspiring
it's amazing how quickly lady <unk> went from <unk> to <unk> isn't it
meanwhile <unk> is a <unk> middle aged voice from the past who in a time long ago made news with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> compared to the <unk> of today
consider their norms
going <unk> that's without underwear because yes there's even a phrase for it
giving birth on tv
posing naked for mainstream magazines
the <unk> sisters spent the fall one <unk> each other first kim's naked <unk> on the cover of paper and then <unk> naked pregnant <unk> online at <unk> because if one reality sister does it so too must the other
<unk> <unk> meanwhile continues to one up herself <unk> from <unk> fingers and <unk> <unk> to her recent full <unk> magazine spread in <unk> magazine the release of which she celebrated with a crude <unk> on social media
but what's next
what does she or any of these women do for an <unk>
where does a <unk> culture go from here for <unk>
the <unk> has already been pushed beyond what we once thought were the limits
what is left
perhaps they'll think of something
you just know those most shocking shows are trying to figure out how to show somebody actually die
you know that some <unk> on the <unk> will go beyond a private sex tape to arrange to be caught in the act
or maybe we'll grow up and become more european in our <unk> and react less like middle school boys at the sight of a <unk>
maybe we'll learn that hitting bottom <unk> reveals a whole new bottom underneath
whatever the <unk> the bottom is in sight
after all being outrageous today is hard work and only getting harder
the <unk> meanwhile has nowhere to go but down

child trafficking is a long standing problem in china

among the more <unk> gifts given to the queen was a <unk> seven <unk> throne from the game of <unk> tv series during a visit to northern ireland in june
however it's far from the most <unk> present <unk> upon the monarch
during her sixty two year long reign the queen has received a <unk> from brazil two giant <unk> from the <unk> an elephant from cameroon and several horses most notably a beloved black mare called <unk> from the royal canadian mounted police
indeed the queen <unk> <unk> at the traditional <unk> the color parade for eighteen consecutive years and in two thousand and five unveiled a bronze statue of herself atop the horse outside the <unk> <unk> building in canada
but what happens to the many gifts her <unk> receives throughout the year that aren't to her taste
live animals are donated to london zoo <unk> items such as food and flowers are given to local <unk> and all other presents which don't go on display in the royal <unk> are stored at the royal archive at <unk> castle a <unk> house spokesperson told cnn
some items are even <unk> to <unk> such as a <unk> canoe given by the new zealand government which is now on display at the british museum
when it comes to royal presents the <unk> great <unk> prince george recorded the largest <unk> in two thousand and fourteen
during a tour of australia and new zealand with his parents the duke and duchess of cambridge the <unk> received a <unk> <unk> <unk> skin <unk> and more soft toys than other children would get in a lifetime of <unk>
<unk> the previous year prince george also received a <unk> wearing the same <unk> <unk> as those worn by the <unk> <unk> from <unk> group great british racing
will the young prince also <unk> a love of horse racing passed down through the centuries
indeed legend has it queen victoria became so excited while watching a race at <unk> one time that she broke the window of the royal box in a rush to see the finish
queen elizabeth ii was more contained than her great great grandmother though still <unk> <unk> when her own horse estimate won britain's prestigious gold cup race in two thousand and thirteen
so what would one buy for the horse racing mad monarch that hasn't been bought before
the ultimate gift would be a nomination to <unk> or <unk> the two most expensive <unk> in the world said nick <unk> from great british racing of the chance to <unk> a mare with some of the most prized <unk> on the planet
a mare <unk> with <unk> including a live <unk> guarantee would cost someone one hundred and twenty five thousand
at that price it's a gift fit for a queen

our first and foremost priority is to <unk> with the police investigation but we still have to wait for the results to see what measures can be taken to <unk> the security level he said
the militants appear to have killed one of the two japanese hostages they have been holding
and they're apparently demanding the release of a convicted terrorist in jordan to spare the life of the other
here's where things stand at the moment
a video file posted online saturday by a known isis supporter shows an image of one hostage kenji goto holding a photo of what appears to be the corpse of his fellow captive haruna yukawa
the voice of a person claiming to be goto speaks over the image saying in english that japanese prime minister shinzo abe is to blame for yukawa's death
you were given a deadline he says referring to isis earlier demand that japan pay two hundred million dollar by friday to save the lives of the two hostages
the voice then <unk> a new ultimatum
the release of sajida al rishawi an iraqi woman facing the death penalty in jordan for her role in a series of bombings in two thousand and five that killed dozens of people at hotels in the arab kingdom
abe said sunday that experts were analyzing the video but that it seemed highly credible
u.s. authorities said they had no reason to doubt its authenticity
an isis affiliated online radio station al <unk> reported that the recording was released by the extremist group
it also reported the killing of yukawa and the prisoner swap demand for goto in its <unk> sunday
it didn't identify goto by name
but goto's <unk> <unk> ishido raised doubts about whether it was his <unk> voice in the video
i get the sense it's not his voice he told reporters
i've heard his english a couple times
i felt it was a bit different
abe condemned the apparent killing of yukawa and called for goto to be released immediately
such act of terrorism is outrageous and <unk> which causes me nothing but strong <unk> he said
but the japanese prime minister declined to comment on how his government would respond to the new demand which doesn't appear to have a clear deadline
after isis released the first video of the hostages tuesday japan set up a crisis center in jordan and said it was trying to communicate with the militant group through third parties such as governments in the region and tribal leaders
japanese officials declined to explicitly rule out paying a ransom but said they wouldn't yield to terrorism
they stressed that an aid package abe had pledged to countries affected by isis cited by the militant group as the reason for the huge ransom demand was only for humanitarian purposes
i would be surprised if the jordanian government or japan really pushed forward and released this female suicide bomber as isis has requested said cnn global affairs analyst david <unk> referring to al rishawi whose explosives failed to go off in the hotel attack in which she participated
cnn law enforcement analyst tom <unk> called the swap a <unk> noting that isis is already holding a jordanian pilot whose plane crashed in syria
jordan is part of the u.s. led coalition that's conducting airstrikes against isis targets
if there is any bargain going to be struck between jordan and isis it's going to include their pilot said <unk> a former fbi assistant director
<unk> <unk> the chief executive of south asia middle east <unk> highlighted the high profile of al rishawi in jordan
this jordanian prisoner is probably the biggest terrorist prisoner that jordan has <unk> told cnn
to release her it's just going to require i think a lot more than just this one japanese hostage she said
yukawa forty two comes across as a lost soul who went to syria last year in search of purpose after suffering a series of <unk> in his life
over the past decade yukawa had attempted suicide lost his wife to cancer and then lost his home and business
after changing his first name to its <unk> form he said he believed he was the <unk> of a <unk> princess who <unk> on the japanese in world war ii
on a blog yukawa once wrote i look normal outside but inside i'm mentally ill
but his <unk> to syria appeared to have been an attempt to <unk> his life
he had dreams of setting up private security company
it was there that he met goto forty seven an experienced freelance journalist who frequently reported from war zones
goto has a wife and two young daughters in japan
despite their <unk> backgrounds the two apparently became friends in syria with goto helping show yukawa how to get by in a <unk> environment
after yukawa was reported to have been captured in august goto is believed to have decided to go into isis controlled territory with finding his friend among his goals
yukawa's father has expressed <unk> over his son's apparent killing
i have been <unk> such a thing would not happen but unfortunately it has finally come to pass and my heart <unk> <unk> yukawa said in an interview with japanese media
i feel so guilty that mr. goto has been detained and threatened death after he had entered there to rescue my son at the risk of his life he added
i wish him to be released and return to japan immediately and continue his activity
goto's mother made a plea to her son's captors to release him on friday saying he wasn't an enemy of isis
words fail to describe how i feel junko ishido said
kenji always has been a kind person ever since he was little
he was always saying i want to save the lives of children in war zones
u.s. president barack obama spoke with abe by phone sunday from new delhi the white house said
obama offered condolences for the murder of yukawa by isis and <unk> solidarity with the japanese people according to a statement
the u.n. security council said in a statement that it strongly <unk> the apparent killing of yukawa describing it as a <unk> and <unk> act
it demanded the immediate release of goto
british prime minister david cameron suggested japan was right not to bow to the terrorists demand for ransom saying that britain strongly supports the firm stance prime minister abe and his government have taken
the united states and britain both refuse to pay ransoms to terrorists
but other countries notably france have reportedly spent tens of millions of dollars on the release of hostages held by islamic militants in recent years despite denying it publicly
japan has also paid kidnappers to free its citizens in the past according to the new york times

hundreds of boko haram gunmen launched a <unk> attack sunday on maiduguri the capital of borno state
soldiers <unk> the attacks and officials have since <unk> a <unk> imposed as a result said col. <unk> <unk> a military spokesman
but a <unk> attack on nearby monguno town was a different story
the islamist militants captured the town together with its military barracks a nigerian military officer said
it's unclear how many people were wounded or killed during the battle for the two cities
our soldiers initially <unk> the terrorists but they mobilized more fighters and came back in full force
they <unk> our troops and forced them to retreat the military officer said
he asked not to be named because he's not authorized to speak to the media
monguno is about one hundred and thirty five kilometers from maiduguri
the former has a population of one hundred thousand while maiduguri has about six hundred thousand
both cities are near the chad and cameroon borders which would give the militants an entry point into those countries
monguno and its military post served as a <unk> to keep the militants away from maiduguri
its fall leaves maiduguri vulnerable and puts the extremists in a better position to seize the city
boko haram had been confined to the fishing town of baga since its fighters seized it on january three
thousands were feared killed in that attack which lasted days
borno gov
<unk> <unk> said soldiers will continue their crackdown on the militants
so long as we have the resources we will continue to regard the efforts to reclaim peace our no
one area of commitments he said
i want to <unk> the good people of borno state that we will never <unk> from our responsibility as those they <unk> with leadership
the attack came a day after president <unk> jonathan made a campaign stop in maiduguri ahead of the february fourteen presidential election
u.s. secretary of state john kerry was also in the nation sunday to call for peaceful elections

roxas said the commandos were <unk> from the assault on their targets when they came under fire from members of the <unk>
in <unk> away from the <unk> assault they <unk> into territory controlled by the milf several kilometers away and a <unk> <unk>
the government had not been seeking to <unk> the peace agreement with the milf by carrying out the operation without their knowledge he said
we are hopeful and confident that this will not <unk> the peace talks he said
this was not directed against milf but this is directed against a very very specific high profile terrorist bomber who was in the area
<unk> said that it was most highly likely that <unk> has been killed in the <unk> assault and dna testing was being carried out to confirm this
but initial reports suggested that <unk> had fled
a board of inquiry would conduct an investigation into the operation including looking into the apparent lack of coordination with milf forces in the area said <unk>
<unk> <unk> chief negotiator for the milf said in an interview with philippine radio station <unk> that a lack of coordination between the milf ceasefire committee and the government was to blame for the outbreak of violence
it was a standard operating procedure that one side should <unk> the other before they began an operation he said describing the incident as self defense
while the area where the fighting occurred was mostly under milf control he said <unk> which was also involved in the firefight was a mobile group moving throughout the region
chances are they were just there when it happened he said
he said his group was doing everything it could to ease tensions over the fighting and that the incident would not have an effect on the ongoing peace process
the philippines signed an agreement with the milf the largest rebel group in the south in march last year
the deal offered greater <unk> economic and political power in return for the rebels <unk> their weapons and ending a decades long insurgency
but hardline rebel groups opposed to the peace process such as the <unk> remain active
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> public affairs office chief for the armed forces of the philippines appealed to the hardline <unk> group monday to return any personnel under their control
we are also calling on our brothers in the <unk> islamic freedom fighters that if indeed they are still holding some of the <unk> personnel they must respect their rights and they must be returned to their mother units and ultimately to their family members he told reporters

at an australia day function in <unk> abbott was forced to defend his decision and dismissed the reaction on twitter as electronic graffiti
i think that in the media you make a big mistake to pay too much attention to social media
you wouldn't report what's sprayed up on the walls of buildings abbott was quoted as saying in the sydney morning herald
of prince philip abbott said
he's the patron of hundreds of organizations
he's the inspiration and <unk> of the duke of <unk> awards which have provided leadership training for tens if not hundreds of thousands of australians over the years
the ninety three year old duke is the only son of prince andrew of greece whose ancestors <unk> from <unk> <unk>
he married in queen elizabeth ii in one thousand nine hundred and forty seven who is head of the <unk> and is required to sign off on <unk> decision an <unk> not lost on australia's <unk>

at the time abbott said the honor of becoming a <unk> and <unk> of the order of australia would be extended to australians of extraordinary and pre <unk> achievement and <unk>
my intention is that this new award will go to those who have accepted public office rather than sought it and who can never by <unk> of that office ever entirely return to private life he said
so far only one <unk> and three <unk> have been appointed including air chief <unk> sir <unk> <unk> who has most recently led operations to recover lost malaysian flights mh three hundred and seventy and mh seventeen
opposition leader bill <unk> said australia had entered a <unk> to extend the honor to english <unk>
it's not about him but he's a british royal why would we give him our top australian honor
he's already got a lot of them he said
some wondered how prince philip would react to the announcement
for others it was an opportunity to <unk> some the <unk> famous quotes
some thought it was sure sign phil could take some of australia's other top honors
and then there was the lone voice calling for calm
sort of
at the time of writing buckingham palace had yet to release an official statement
though its twitter account posted a link to learn more about the australian royal family
abbott didn't take to twitter to try to <unk> the spray of e graffiti

as the fuselage <unk> the surface on sunday one body appeared in the water and was <unk> authorities said
it's the seventy th recovered so far during weeks of searching

i still don't want to believe it <unk> yukawa told japanese broadcaster nhk his face not shown in the report
if i can see him again i'd like to hold him in my arms
goto's mother junko ishido had made an emotional plea friday for the release of her son saying he isn't an enemy of isis
kenji always has been a kind person ever since he was little she said
he was always saying i want to save the lives of children in war zones
goto forty seven is an experienced freelance journalist who frequently reported from war zones
he met yukawa who had dreams of setting up a private security firm while they were both in syria last year according to friends
after yukawa was reported to have been captured in august goto apparently decided to leave his wife and two young daughters in japan to go into isis territory to try to <unk> him
i asked my son's wife why he had made this decision and the response was that my son felt he had to do everything in his power to help and rescue his friend ishido said
but rather than save yukawa goto ended up becoming another captive in the hands of a brutal militant group that has slaughtered countless iraqis and syrians as well as three americans and two <unk>
u.s. president barack obama spoke with abe by phone sunday from new delhi the white house said
obama offered condolences for the murder of yukawa by isis and <unk> solidarity with the japanese people according to a statement

now that his party has apparently won the support of his country's voters <unk> tsipras has another fight in front of him
making good on his campaign promise to <unk> the terms of greece's bailout
we are <unk> our lost dignity
now that we are heard by all of europe we will fight with the same passion the same confidence tsipras told <unk> supporters
so let's go and let's all continue this beautiful and tough fight
with more than seventy percents of votes counted syriza was officially <unk> to win at least one hundred and forty nine seats in the three hundred seat parliament
exit polls also placed the party in the lead
but analysts cautioned that it was still too close to call whether syriza would win a majority of seats a key step that would allow the party to govern without forming a coalition government
tsipras forty who could become greece's next prime minister also vowed to end austerity measures
greece leaves behind the austerity that <unk> it leaves behind the fear leaves behind five years of <unk> and greece moves forward with optimism and hope and dignity he told the crowd
syriza's <unk> to try to get some of greece's <unk> debt written off and <unk> back <unk> austerity measures appealed to <unk> members of the <unk> even if they potentially <unk> greece's place in the <unk>
the election could lead to a dramatic <unk> with the debt laden nation's <unk>
that is a gamble that people in greece seem to be prepared to take at this point simply because the terms of its bailout have been so severe greek journalist <unk> <unk> told cnn on sunday
one of those people willing to take the risk is <unk> <unk> a former public sector employee
people went <unk> since we entered the bailout poverty is visible across society and i believe that hope is coming with syriza's program not only for greece but for all of europe she said ahead of the election
the austerity imposed by greece's international <unk> has cut deep
unemployment has <unk> to twenty eight percents and many people who still have jobs have seen <unk> <unk> in wages <unk> frozen and the retirement age pushed back
the governing new democracy party had pointed to recent improvements in economic <unk> as signs things were getting better
after <unk> defeat sunday <unk> prime minister <unk> <unk> said his conscience was clear
i got a country on the <unk> of ruin
i was asked to try and save it and i did it he said
most people did not believe we could stand strong but we did
now he said greece is secure and slowly walking away from the crisis
and more than anything he said i give back a country that is a member of the european parliament and the euro
in his victory speech sunday tsipras noted that greece's election could have an impact far beyond his country's borders
our victory is at the same time it's a victory for all the people of europe that are fighting against austerity that's <unk> the common european future he said
his message is one that has <unk> in other southern european countries under the restrictions of international <unk>
syriza's victory could boost other <unk> parties like <unk> <unk> anti euro five star movement in italy and the <unk> movement in spain
but it's unclear how its plans to <unk> the bailout would play out
is <unk> tsipras man of the moment
the militants launched a <unk> attack on the town of monguno and were apparently successful in taking control of the town and its military barracks a nigerian military officer in maiduguri told cnn

both cities are <unk> into the corner of the country near the borders with chad and cameroon
<unk> <unk> a monguno resident who fled to maiduguri said several trucks carrying soldiers drove into maiduguri
we learned the town has been taken over by boko haram
monguno with its huge military barracks has a strategic importance in that it acts as a <unk> to keep boko haram from advancing towards maiduguri
its fall means boko haram is in good position to advance on maiduguri which has been its goal for months
boko haram had been confined to the fishing town of baga since its fighters seized it january three <unk> to move south towards maiduguri because of the military presence in monguno

the islamists attacked the nearby village of jintilo around five a.m. and were engaged in a <unk> with troops stationed there
the village is about five kilometers from the center of maiduguri the capital of borno state
the fighting in jintilo forced residents to evacuate their homes and flee into the city while military authorities imposed a round the clock <unk> to prevent <unk> by the militants

we have no interest in seeing russia weakened or its economy in <unk>

speaking in new delhi after a lengthy flight on air force one obama said sunday he will look at all the additional options that are available to us short of military confrontation
on monday obama will be the first u.s. leader to headline india's annual republic day parade a colorful military spectacle featuring marching <unk> dancing and lots of heavy <unk> rolling down the <unk> <unk> boulevard

the secretary reiterated the need for an immediate <unk> of the ceasefire a withdrawal of heavy weapons and closing the border
he also <unk> u.s. <unk> to participate in serious settlement efforts making clear that <unk> is in <unk> interests that russia will be <unk> by its actions and that the costs to russia will only increase if attacks continue
kerry has previously warned of increased international pressure on russia

president barack obama and prime minister narendra modi stopped short of announcing a full <unk> deal but did say they'd moved forward on the issue
this is an important step that shows how we can work together to <unk> our relationship obama said during a press conference that came after bilateral talks with modi
obama touched down in india on sunday for a <unk> state visit that has officials claiming a new era in u.s. india relations is <unk>
obama hopes to <unk> on his young friendship with modi to achieve diplomatic progress on climate defense and trade progress that has <unk> u.s. leaders in the past

on monday obama will be the first u.s. leader to headline india's annual republic day parade a colorful military spectacle featuring marching <unk> dancing and lots of heavy <unk> rolling down the <unk> <unk> boulevard
the white house says the invitation to act as the <unk> honored guest came as a major shock and could open the way for new cooperation between new delhi and washington
obama himself sees the invitation as a <unk> moment for u.s. india relations according to his aides
i think it goes without saying that this is a <unk> moment in the bilateral relationship and that the <unk> of this invitation by the prime minister really continues to set a different tone for our <unk> partnership said phil <unk> senior director for south asia on obama's national security council staff
but even the parade itself will act as a reminder of the decades of sometimes tense relations between the two countries
a military demonstration at heart the vehicles and equipment <unk> before obama on monday will be mostly russian made a <unk> of india's stance during the cold war
russia remains india's largest <unk> of weapons and while their share is steadily <unk> russian military imports still amount to three quarters of india's <unk>
with u.s. russia relations worsening to cold war levels obama hopes to balance <unk> influence in india during his visit this week
officials also hope to exact climate commitments in new delhi where air quality warnings remained in place even during obama's visit
that's a contrast to obama's trip late last year to beijing where roads were cleared and the air <unk> of its usual <unk> ahead of the president's arrival
in china obama was able to secure historic carbon reduction promises from the new premier there though expectations for similar achievements in india were more <unk>

london's royal free hospital announced saturday that <unk> cafferkey has been <unk> from the royal free following her recovery from ebola
on december twenty nine the thirty nine year old glasgow scotland resident became the first person to be diagnosed with the virus on uk soil shortly after returning from sierra leone
five days later the royal free hospital announced her condition had <unk> to critical
that meant all the more reason to celebrate saturday's news
prime minister david cameron was among those <unk> in tweeting great to hear <unk> cafferkey has been <unk> from hospital
thank you to everyone <unk> for the world class care
cafferkey contracted ebola while working with save the children at an ebola treatment center according to michael <unk> <unk> humanitarian director at that organization
british media outlets said cafferkey is a public health nurse in <unk> south <unk> area who was part of a thirty strong team of medical volunteers deployed to west africa by the uk government last month in a joint endeavor with save the children
she traveled via <unk> morocco and london heathrow airport before arriving at glasgow airport on a british airways flight late last year the health agency <unk> scotland said
after feeling <unk> she sought medical attention and became the first person to be diagnosed with ebola within the united kingdom
she was reportedly transferred to london in a military aircraft <unk> with an isolation <unk> and brought to the royal free hospital
that facility has a high level isolation unit with access restricted to specially trained medical staff
a specially designed tent with controlled <unk> is set up over the patient's bed
as she got treatment there save the children said that it was doing everything possible to establish how cafferkey contracted ebola and had been conducting a review since she was confirmed as having the virus
one of the first statements she made before making a direct plea to isis to spare her son's life was an apology to the japanese people
thank you for your great <unk> and i apologize for the tremendous inconvenience and trouble that my son has caused she said
the plea came just before a seventy two hour deadline for a two hundred million dollar ransom set in the video was due to <unk>
the japanese government appears not to have given into the demand and a day later her son appeared again this time holding a photo that purported to show the <unk> body of his <unk> haruna yukawa
now the jihadist group is demanding the release of sajida al rishawi a female terrorist being held in jordan in exchange for goto's life
<unk> public apology is <unk> in the context of japanese society says jeff kingston director of asian studies at temple <unk> tokyo <unk>
in japan when you inconvenience people it's important to respect them and ask for forgiveness kingston says
ishido <unk> several times how badly she feels about her son's capture causing trouble for the japanese government and alarm for its people
to her it doesn't matter that her son was likely trying to rescue his friend and fellow hostage haruna yukawa
it doesn't matter than he has been praised by friends colleagues and strangers for reporting <unk> from war zones like syria with strong respectful determination
if she were to say such things publicly in japan she could be perceived as a <unk> individual who <unk> the <unk> of her son
because of this ishido a desperate mother with a son in imminent danger of brutal murder at the hands of a militant jihadist group apologized to her country from the bottom of my heart
and then begged for help
i <unk> to the japanese government to save <unk> life ishido said
to all members of isis kenji is not the enemy of isis
please release him
kingston says public sympathy for the two hostages is mixed partly because of their vastly different backgrounds
there's a <unk> in the public between goto and yukawa kingston told cnn ahead of the news of yukawa's apparent murder
there is a great deal of respect for the journalist and what he's done and his experience
yukawa is looked at as a <unk> <unk> who put himself in <unk> way
so many are asking why should it be the government and the <unk> problem
in two thousand and four three young japanese hostages were released by militants in iraq
instead of being welcomed home they were <unk> for causing trouble for japan
the former hostages including one who was in iraq helping children before her capture were even <unk> by the government for their <unk>
they got the <unk> <unk> you can imagine
it was essentially government encouraged <unk> kingston says adding the trauma of their return was in some ways worse than their capture
in the previous hostage crisis under japan's former prime minister <unk> <unk> during the iraq war language like self responsibility and go at your own risk was <unk> into the japanese <unk>
for most japanese citizens areas of the middle east ravaged by conflict are perceived as distant dangerous places the opposite of the safety and calm that <unk> japanese society
many in japan don't understand why anyone would leave the island nation and travel to such hostile regions where they face potential capture by terror groups like isis
therefore many find it difficult to <unk> with those who choose to go
goto has received more sympathy because the japanese media has widely reported on his commitment to telling the stories of suffering women and children
according to his own online posts yukawa was a troubled man and as such he has received far less sympathy back home in japan
he lost his wife to cancer and then his home and business to <unk>
at one point he attempted suicide and took a traditionally female name
on the outside i look normal he wrote in one post
but inside i'm mentally ill
it seems he went to the middle east looking for a fresh start and wanted to be a private security contractor even though he had no experience
he's seen as <unk> kingston says
kingston adds this latest incident has the potential to change the way japanese society feels about prime minister shinzo <unk> approach of <unk> <unk>
the isis video was released just two days after abe was in the middle east pledging two hundred million dollar in humanitarian aid to the coalition against isis a commitment the japanese government insists it will honor no matter what happens to the hostages
however the public might feel about the two men who they watched <unk> in the desert on their computers and tv <unk> there is no doubt that the sight of their <unk> <unk> capture at the hands of isis has brought the situation in iraq and syria into sharp relief
islamic extremism was something you watched on tv that happened to other people kingston says
and now it's happening to the japanese
yet nowadays this region is especially turbulent with waves <unk> several countries so big that their effects are being felt worldwide including the west
it's not like this <unk> is <unk> only in one country or all for a common reason
there's islamic extremism political <unk> <unk> oil prices and let's not forget age old sectarian tensions that are contributing in different ways in different places to the <unk>
many countries in the region have issues such as egypt's <unk> political and human rights situation and turkey's dealing with the impact of the war raging right over its border in syria
still a few stand out because of the unique some might say <unk> challenges they face
chaos is one way to describe it
the country's government is in a <unk>
violence some of it sectarian some of it thanks to <unk> from al qaeda in the arabian peninsula has been raging nationwide for months if not years
and it's far and away the poorest nation in the region with a per capita gdp of one thousand four hundred and seventy three dollar according to the world bank
let's start with the still <unk> political crisis
yemen's president and prime minister <unk> resigned thursday after houthi rebels moved on the capital <unk>
how yemen's new government will look is still unclear if it's going to have a <unk> government at all
if the houthis take the lead that would mean <unk> ruling a country that's mostly sunni
while the houthis and previous government both fought against al qaeda this instability can only help that terror group
and none of this is helping the average yemeni stuck in poverty with little time money or effort seemingly focused on improving their straits or the economy as a whole
why it matters to the west and beyond
for the rest of the world political stability is a good thing for any country in this region
on the <unk> side instability is always a concern
there's also the fact that yemen has enough oil and natural gas for its people and export though unrest makes it challenging to tap into these resources the u.s. energy information administration notes
all those worries and <unk> are real
but for the west it's about aqap
ever since osama bin laden was <unk> out of afghanistan the terrorist organization he founded has spread out and evolved
rather than one <unk> <unk> al qaeda is now more of an association of groups each with its own goals even if they all share a philosophy of <unk> out at the west and promoting their extreme brand of islam
and of those aqap is widely considered the most dangerous to the west
it's the only al qaeda affiliate to send terrorists from yemen to the united states
there was umar farouk abdulmutallab better known as the underwear bomber for his attempt to blow up a commercial airliner on a detroit bound flight in december two thousand and nine
then there are the suspects in the deadly boston marathon bombings and <unk> hassan who reportedly were inspired by american born cleric and top aqap figure anwar al awlaki
the united states isn't the only place affected
aqap has claimed to be behind the january seven charlie hebdo massacre and one of the brothers involved cherif kouachi told cnn affiliate <unk> that he trained in yemen on a trip <unk> by al awlaki
al awlaki is dead but his organization is not
with both yemen's government and the houthis focused on each other aqap has more space to recruit and train terrorists as well as <unk> ways for them to strike
yemen's political <unk> is especially unsettling for countries like the united states which had a strong working alliance with now <unk> president abdu rabu mansour hadi and his government
as of thursday u.s. officials haven't held any talks with the houthis nor did they know their <unk>
since its founding in one thousand nine hundred and thirty two the kingdom of saudi arabia has been one of the most stable not to mention richest countries in not just the middle east but the world
it had a new new leader friday and let's just say the timing could have been better
saudi arabia has had political transition before with six kings in its modern day history the latest being king salman who took power friday following the death of his half brother king abdullah bin abdulaziz
the new leader has already <unk> that he won't <unk> much from his <unk> policies saying we will with god's will and power <unk> to the straight path this country has followed since its establishment
still change is change and king salman will be challenged from the get go
riyadh has long played a part in <unk> the region a role that is needed as much as ever
iraq is battling isis militants who already control much of the country and are threatening to take the rest
the sunni led government in neighboring yemen is out with <unk> of what comes next or whether some of its violence will <unk> over into saudi
and there's the threat from across the <unk> gulf in iran
on top of all this the price of the arab nation's economic driver oil has <unk> over fifty percents since the summer to less than fifty dollar a barrel
that's key because oil revenues are a bit part of saudi government's revenues and a big reason it's so important on the world stage
why it matters to the west and beyond
the middle east is <unk> enough especially since the arab spring
the saudi government was one a few regional governments to weather that storm <unk>
but now there's even more need for stability something that having a new leader may not help with
it is very possible that saudi policy doesn't change much under king salman
even if that's true it's much too early to tell whether or not he can be a leader throughout the region
can or will he try to help <unk> peace between palestinians and israel as did king abdullah
can or will he be able to have any influence keeping yemen under control
likewise it's not yet clear how the transition will affect the saudi government's relationship with the united states whose leaders have long been able to count on riyadh for <unk> and support
another possible impact of king salman's <unk> has nothing to do with <unk> but rather how much you pay at the gas pump
the new king could <unk> the amount of oil <unk> in saudi arabia which would <unk> supply and increase prices
even without any saudi action the price of oil has already started climbing after king abdullah's death
syria's <unk> began in spring two thousand and eleven with protests in the nation's streets
president bashar al assad's government responded with a deadly crackdown an act that only seemed to fuel the unrest
and it only got worse from there
eventually the <unk> and violence <unk> into a full <unk> civil war
it's been a bloody war with the united nations <unk> nearly two hundred thousand killed as of last august
it's been a <unk> war with more than three million syrians now refugees and at least six point five million more displaced inside the country
and it hasn't been a simple war given all the <unk> parties involved
that's because there isn't just one united opposition group fighting against al assad who is still in power and <unk> in damascus
there are more moderate fighting groups some of which have gotten support from washington and beyond
and there are extremists who have been able to attract new recruits gain more influence and take over territory amid the chaos
one of them is al nusra front an al qaeda affiliate the u.s. state department has designated a terrorist organization that's taken over territory in northwestern syria
another is isis which first emerged in iraq but got a second life in syria thanks to the ongoing war
it has terrorized many in both countries in recent months a time in which its taken over vast swaths of territory established a de facto capital in the syrian city of <unk> and <unk> itself the islamic state in <unk> with its quest to be a caliphate <unk> under its strict interpretation of sharia law
why it matters to the west and beyond
even before isis made daily headlines the <unk> of what's been happening in syria was enough to get the world's attention
with large numbers of civilians dying with the alleged use of chemical weapons with neighboring countries like turkey and jordan finding themselves <unk> by refugees it couldn't be avoided from a practical and personal <unk>
none of those concerns have gone away
syria borders turkey a nato member as well as jordan and israel two <unk> u.s. allies
besides the refugee issue there is a constant threat that the violence will <unk> over the syrian border
even without that a seemingly endless civil war in this part of the world is never good for most anyone the west included
it's not just that there's violence it's who is behind it and in many ways thriving because of it
isis wouldn't be what it is without the syrian civil war
that means it wouldn't be a <unk> point for u.s. president barack obama and his government
already isis has beheaded a number of u.s. and british hostages all of them civilians and threatened more
there's also the real threat that the group may take its campaign out of the middle east to strike in the west
that may have happened this month in france
one of the three terrorists there amedy coulibaly proclaimed his allegiance to isis in a video and investigators discovered isis flags along with automatic weapons <unk> and cash in an apartment he rented france's rtl radio reported sunday citing authorities
the west and some of its middle eastern allies are striking back with targeted airstrikes not only in iraq where the coalition has a willing partner but in syria where it is not working with al assad
u.s. diplomatic officials said thursday that estimates are that this coalition has killed more than six thousand isis fighters
yet their work is far from done
the group boasts <unk> of thirty one thousand fighters not to mention fresh recruits seemingly coming in regularly
iraq is no stranger to war in recent decades from its war with iran in the one thousand nine hundred and eighty s to the first gulf war in the early one thousand nine hundred and ninety s to a u.s. led invasion in two thousand and three
and it has seen plenty of bad actors in that stretch like late leader <unk> hussein who used chemical weapons against his enemies including the one thousand nine hundred and eighty eight attack on the kurdish town of <unk>
even then isis stands out
the group began in two thousand and four as al qaeda in iraq a particularly destructive arm of bin <unk> terror network with an <unk> for attacking coalition forces as well as those locals who didn't accept this sunni group's extreme islamic beliefs
international military efforts helped to beat back the group but it never totally went away
<unk> as the islamic state the terror group came back stronger and seemingly more <unk> than ever
it killed and kidnapped including many civilians using tactics so extreme that even al qaeda <unk> it
members of the minority <unk> group reported being treated like cattle as their men were slaughtered and their women and girls were <unk> and sold
it distributed a pamphlet in mosul <unk> its <unk> and having sex with <unk> women and girls
it's not just that isis is <unk>
it's been successful
the terror group has taken over large <unk> of territory in iraq including oil fields and the key city of mosul and even threatened its capital of baghdad
why it matters to the west and beyond
iraq matters because it has been a place where islamist extremists can strike the west
for years that meant attacking coalition military forces based there
now that they are gone the fear is that iraq will become a training ground for isis militants to prepare for strikes outside the middle east
that's why in august obama authorized the first of what have come to be hundreds of targeted airstrikes conducted with international allies to counter militants in iraq as well as syria
it appears to have made a difference not only in killing the estimated six thousand isis fighters but in helping iraqi forces reclaim territory
u.s. secretary of state john kerry said thursday that iraq has taken back more than two hundred and seventy square miles
iraqi prime minister <unk> al abadi told cnn's christiane amanpour this week he expects isis even if it is not <unk> entirely should be gone from his country within months claiming the group's onslaught
has been <unk>
i think we have the capability now with enough support from the international coalition al abadi said
any such predictions need to be taken with a grain of salt
that's especially true in iraq where terrorists have been reportedly ousted before only to return
plus it is not as though the end of isis necessarily will signal an end to iraq's problems
like saudi arabia this big time oil producer has to cope with the impact of lower prices
and there was violence before isis surge including a good number of terrorist attacks so it seems <unk> to expect that will go away
the islamic revolution happened in one thousand nine hundred and seventy nine
there has been <unk> protests since then but none have <unk> to anything
in some ways politically iran has been the picture of stability with two <unk> leaders in the past thirty six years with ayatollah <unk> <unk> and his successor ali khamenei
yet iran's relations with the rest of the world haven't been so calm
part of it has to do with iranian leaders hard line stance against israel as <unk> in ayatollah <unk> nine point explanation last november for why israel should be <unk>
the ayatollah and his supporters haven't been much <unk> to the united states with <unk> anti american rallies and harsh <unk> of washington common
then there's iran's nuclear program one that since two thousand and three has fueled concern worldwide that <unk> plans are not simply energy development as iranian officials have said but may be to develop nuclear <unk> that could strike israel and beyond
this dispute has led to major sanctions on iran hurting that nation's economy and <unk> it from much of the world
but there's been some signs of hope since the two thousand and thirteen election of president hassan <unk>
since then the rhetoric has notably <unk>
and while there's been no <unk> deal at least iran has engaged in <unk> talks with western officials on the nuclear issue
why it matters to the west and beyond
think of it this way
would you want leaders of a country known for death to america <unk> to have a nuclear weapon
the united states sure does not
nor do its european allies
and certainly neither does israel
one concern is that all of these recent negotiations are simply <unk>
iran some <unk> say may be <unk> closer to producing nuclear weapons behind <unk> backs while they talk peace
and it's not as though every leader in iran is embracing peaceful rhetoric
nuclear weapons or not seemingly anything could tip the <unk> toward war
the latest point of <unk> <unk> to an israeli attack in syria's golan heights that killed a senior iranian commander and six hezbollah members
speaking about that incident thursday according to state run press tv the iranian revolutionary <unk> brig
gen. <unk> <unk> said
should be waiting for <unk> <unk>
israel is one of most modern <unk> prosperous countries
but ever since its founding in one thousand nine hundred and forty eight it has also been one of the most challenged when it comes to security and that hasn't changed
hamas and israeli forces fought for seven weeks this summer in gaza a conflict that killed more than two thousand one hundred and thirty palestinians most of them civilians according to the united nations
sixty seven israelis sixty four of them soldiers have been killed the u.n. reported
a foreign worker in israel was killed as well
the violence has died down since then but it hasn't gone away
there was a november attack at a jerusalem synagogue that killed four <unk> and a police officer
an israeli soldier was stabbed to death on a tel aviv street with another killed at a west bank <unk> post
many palestinians have been caught up in everything as well like a senior palestinian authority official who died after a confrontation with israeli troops
no three <unk> <unk> yet but few signs of hope either
meanwhile there's an election coming up in israel
prime minister benjamin netanyahu is <unk> to stay in the office he's held since two thousand and nine hoping to convince voters that he's the right person to address a <unk> economy recent attacks against israelis in jerusalem and this <unk> <unk> war against hamas
in fact he's taking his appeal on the road to the united states
house speaker john <unk> has invited netanyahu to speak to congress on march three
but he won't be meeting with obama then a fact that some see as the latest evidence of the reportedly <unk> relationship between the two leaders
why it matters to the west and beyond
israel is important to the united states for a few reasons
some of that has to do with the countries common democratic <unk>
there is also the shared strategic and security interests as it is no <unk> that many of israel's <unk> are also u.s. enemies
and there's a political <unk> as well with many in the united states <unk> the country's relationship with israel and sometimes <unk> their political opponents claiming they're not sufficiently supportive
if the leaders of these two longtime allies aren't on the same page that could be a problem
obama won't personally meet with netanyahu during his next visit because white house spokesman josh earnest said we want to avoid even the appearance of any kind of interference with a democratic election on march seventeen
then there's the prospect that netanyahu will press for stronger sanctions on iran

no truce with ukraine rebel leader says
relief is <unk> in washington over the well planned and <unk> executed transfer of saudi arabia's throne to king salman bin abdulaziz seventy nine following the death of his ninety year old half brother king abdullah
the kingdom despite <unk> rare public dissent with the obama administration over iran and the arab spring is a <unk> of u.s. <unk> in a region where washington is struggling to adapt to <unk> national borders chaotic change and sectarian carnage
never mind that the u.s. is the world's foremost democracy and the transfer of power in saudi arabia was from one <unk> to the next
saudi arabia is crucial to u.s. goals on counter terrorism the campaign against isis and al qaeda the free flow of energy that <unk> the global economy as a counter balance to iran and as a <unk> of the long frustrated quest for peace between israel and the palestinians
in a sign of the kingdom's importance to the united states president barack obama made <unk> plans to call in saudi arabia on tuesday after his trip to india to pay his respects to abdullah and his family and to meet with king salman
originally vice president joe biden was to have made the trip
the message from washington is clearly
long live the new king
the <unk> <unk> in riyadh is especially welcome to the white house as it <unk> with events just across the border in yemen another key ally where a us backed government crucial to its anti terror campaign has just been <unk> to rebels supported by iran
james <unk> smith who served as u.s. ambassador to saudi arabia between two thousand and nine and two thousand and thirteen said there should be no concern in the administration that salman's <unk> will <unk> u.s. relations with the deeply conservative kingdom
we know salman well he was governor of riyadh for the better part of fifty years he is well known to the us government
i see no break in the u.s. saudi relationship smith said
salman vowed just hours after the death of abdullah that the kingdom would continue <unk> to the correct policies which saudi arabia has followed since its establishment
state department spokeswoman <unk> <unk> said that the allies had a long history of cooperation
we don't have any indication that that cooperation will change
saudi <unk> in washington were impressed and <unk> by the line of succession outlined by salman in an apparent effort to solve a <unk> <unk> and send a signal of <unk> to the outside world
he named prince mohammed bin <unk> one of scores of <unk> candidates as deputy crown prince a move which puts him second in line to the throne and <unk> a future transfer of power from the sons of the founder of saudi arabia king abdulaziz ibn <unk> who have ruled the country since the one thousand nine hundred and fifty s to a new generation
i think for the near term <unk> is going to be the <unk> here said daniel benjamin a former coordinator for counter terrorism at the state department now at <unk> college told cnn
there is now a member of the generation of the grandchildren who is second in line he is a very close friend of the united states
so i think there is a lot of hope the relationship will stay on an even <unk>
prince mohammed now behind the king's brother prince muqrin sixty nine in the line of succession is a frequent <unk> to the united states and has <unk> over saudi arabia's anti terrorism program
he <unk> escaped an assassination bid by al qaeda in two thousand and nine
the succession plan was viewed as particularly important following <unk> reports that salman has been in ill health himself apparently having suffered a stroke
tom <unk> <unk> for us relations with saudi arabia when he was obama's national security <unk> praised abdullah as a solid ally who had <unk> two decades of stability in the kingdom
he also said that the late king's survivors had done a pretty effective job of indicating stability with a quick <unk> with <unk> to succession <unk> of policy
he told the lead with cnn's jake tapper that mohammad known as <unk> in the united states was a very very <unk> person who is essential in terms of our joint efforts to combat terrorists
though there is relief at the apparent stability in riyadh relations between the united states and saudi arabia in recent years have have often been troubled
there was a tense period a decade ago after it emerged that fifteen of the nineteen <unk> involved in the september eleven attacks <unk> from saudi arabia
critics including some in the u.s. government <unk> saudis for backing jihadists movements throughout the region for geopolitical reasons
the saudi government has also <unk> at u.s. <unk> of its human rights record and political system
more recently saudi arabia the key sunni power in the middle east has not <unk> to make clear its concern about obama's quest to improve relations with its <unk> shia <unk> iran with which it is fighting various <unk> struggles
saudi leaders were <unk> to learn about a secret <unk> of talks between the administration and iran which built on the election of moderate iranian president hassan <unk> in two thousand and thirteen to launch an effort at <unk> between tehran and washington
i think that the concern remains among the saudi leadership about an agreement that is going to be at their expense said david <unk> an author on saudi arabia and senior scholar at the <unk> center
some analysts believe that the saudi government could react to what it would see as a bad nuclear deal between world powers and iran which left the islamic republic with some capacity to <unk> <unk> or produce <unk> by looking to find its own nuclear capability perhaps with assistance from pakistan
saudi <unk> took to the <unk> <unk> pages of us newspapers in two thousand and thirteen in a highly unusual move to <unk> that a nuclear deal was a dangerous gamble
the saudi government also made clear its deep anger with obama's last minute decision not to launch planned air strikes on syria to punish the bashar al assad <unk> use of chemical weapons the same year
saudi arabia has also been frustrated at how long it has taken the united states to begin training opposition fighters in syria
anger at obama comments on the arab spring
the saudi government also registered anger at the obama <unk> embrace of arab spring <unk> which led to the <unk> of allies like egyptian president <unk> mubarak
obama appeared to make an <unk> reference to those differences in a statement <unk> abdullah on thursday as a <unk> and passionate <unk> in us saudi relations as a force for stability
as a leader he was always <unk> and had the courage of his <unk> obama wrote
in recent years the obama administration has attempted to <unk> saudi fears
the us president made a visit to riyadh last year on a trip that was widely seen as an attempt to <unk> <unk>
saudi arabian pilots reportedly including one of salman's sons prince khaled helped carry out the first air attacks on isis in syria last year
saudi arabia also approved of secretary of state john <unk> <unk> but ultimately <unk> efforts to keep israel and the palestinians talking
and white house spokesman josh earnest said that an <unk> of those efforts an arab peace plan <unk> by abdullah would stand as his <unk> memorial
smith said that the relationship between riyadh and washington was now better than it had been earlier in the administration
a key element of our relationship with the saudis over the years has been transparency not always in public but we have done a good job in talking to each other he said
when you leave your allies out of the conversation and they don't understand your negotiating position or don't understand how you are going to enforce an agreement
they are left to their own conclusions
i think we are doing a lot better at that
the announcement from house speaker john <unk> office this week came after several high level <unk> between u.s. and israeli officials including a phone call between obama and netanyahu and a multi hour meeting between secretary of state john kerry and israeli ambassador ron <unk> a senior administration official told cnn
netanyahu's <unk> has once again <unk> relations between the two world leaders but u.s. officials insist the tensions won't affect u.s. support for israel
the <unk> announcement came just over a week after obama spoke over the phone with netanyahu and urged him not to lobby in favor of new iran sanctions asking for some space a senior administration official said
but the <unk> israeli prime minister has a track record of supporting <unk> sanctions against iran and he's expected to make that case when he addresses congress in march
obama and other world leaders negotiating with iran over its nuclear program have firmly argued against a sanctions bill from congress which they say would <unk> a <unk> international coalition and <unk> negotiations
we asked the israelis in private and public to sit tight and the president made clear if a deal wasn't reached he would be the first in line <unk> for more sanctions the official said
that's what makes netanyahu's decision to address congress a pretty big deal the official added
and just a day before <unk> announcement kerry met for several hours with <unk> who reportedly coordinated the visit between republican congressional leadership and netanyahu
but still there was no word of a netanyahu visit to washington
is this a smart way for them to manage the relationship
a source close to kerry said
the bilateral relationship is <unk> but playing politics with that relationship could <unk> secretary <unk> enthusiasm for being israel's primary <unk>
while u.s. and israeli officials insist publicly that the relationship has never been stronger and by most measures it remains very strong netanyahu's address to congress is just the latest in a string of diplomatic <unk> that each time have <unk> relations between the two leaders and their staff to new <unk>
netanyahu's continued expansion of jewish settlements in east jerusalem has angered u.s. officials prompting one senior white house official to call <unk> a <unk> in an october article in the atlantic that brought private tensions to light
obama's phone call with netanyahu and <unk> meeting with <unk> just before the announcement give the <unk> a more personal <unk>
kerry had made more than fifty calls in the <unk> month to world leaders on the hot topics of israeli palestinian relations such as palestinian attempts to gain <unk> through international organizations the source said adding that <unk> patience is not <unk>
the in your face move from netanyahu's camp comes at a time when israel needs american support on the international stage with palestinians making a full court press to obtain <unk> <unk> through international institutions
another senior u.s. official said the israeli <unk> of protocol and diplomatic <unk> takes a toll on u.s. officials working <unk> to support israel on the international stage
they come to us with a lot of requests but don't have the <unk> of telling us
that is what <unk> it for us the official said
but again the core aspects of the relationship and commitment remain intact the official said
the <unk> may not <unk> the <unk> broad commitment to israel's security and to supporting israel in the international arena but netanyahu will feel the <unk> when he comes to washington in march without a ticket to the white house
the white house announced that obama won't meet with netanyahu during his visit because of the <unk> to israeli elections
netanyahu will address congress just twelve days before the elections
he had asked to push back his visit by nearly a month
u.s. officials aren't the only ones taken <unk>
former israeli president <unk> <unk> while refusing to directly criticize netanyahu <unk> there are rules and norms how two countries have to behave
in that case i think the rules created differences and all of us have to look including our prime minister to go back to the basic rules and respect <unk> said in an interview in davos switzerland on saturday
it would come as no surprise that netanyahu's opponents in the election are harsher
his former finance minister and current <unk> in the march election <unk> lapid said saturday that netanyahu is <unk> our strategic relations with the united states for an election speech
yet ahead of the elections netanyahu's visit may be a <unk> for him and his party in israel as he plays himself up as the best <unk> of israel's security of which a relationship with the united states is a key factor
is that the relationship they want to have
the senior administration official said
the last thing we want to do is hurt israel but if he is able to <unk> the u.s. president like that and we still offer him a meeting that <unk> him and anyone else to do that over and over
the annual january twenty six parade <unk> the day in one thousand nine hundred and fifty when a newly independent republic of india adopted its first constitution
it's india's <unk> moment of pride when <unk> <unk> all and the nation <unk> out its culture <unk> and military might for the world to see
this year president barack obama will see the festivities <unk>
he's the first u.s. leader india has invited to be the guest of honor and the first president to visit india twice in his <unk>
that's a sign i believe of how far india has come from the nation of my childhood
back then i stood in the crowd thinking of things i learned in school about india's rich history and <unk> struggle for freedom from british <unk>
but it was impossible to forget i was born in the third world
signs of poverty and despair were everywhere
i often heard this <unk>
the east shall rise again
but i held no expectations no hopes really that my homeland would ever be any different
not in my lifetime
but over the last two decades i have been going home to a <unk> transformed india one that has experienced <unk> economic growth and social change
now obama is making history with his trip
he'll stand with prime minister narendra modi on <unk> the grand <unk> that leads to india gate <unk> version of the <unk> de <unk>
obama will also be meeting modi for the second time within the span of a few months
the two met at the white house at the end of september on modi's first trip as prime minister to the united states
all this indicates india's arrival on the global stage
<unk> <unk> of the center for strategic and international studies put it this way
it's a big deal
there's no better way to put it
modi's invitation to obama say india experts is a simple but extremely important gesture that could jump start relations between the two countries
modi's a controversial figure
some blame him for doing nothing to stop a massacre of muslims in <unk> the western indian state where he was chief minister
but indians voted him into the highest office of the land in a <unk> landslide victory
they were fed up with years of <unk> and government corruption and in modi they saw the man who can again make india <unk>
south asia expert milan <unk> told me the white house has been waiting a long time to conduct business with india with confidence
in modi they believe they have found that elusive leader and they don't want to pass up the opportunity says <unk> of the <unk> <unk> for international peace
both india and the united states want a strong economy and a strong defense
a good <unk> is that the leaders of the world's two largest <unk> will talk trade and terrorism
they are also likely to take up the issue of chinese <unk>
besides japan india is america's strongest ally on that matter
we really talk about it more as not a <unk> to china but you want a <unk> asian future says <unk> of <unk>
you know you want multiple sources of power in any <unk> and we would love for india to be because of course we've got an <unk> of values
that last point got me thinking about india's growing <unk> and what the world might look like fifty years from now in terms of power
america may not be the <unk> <unk> anymore
and that <unk> from my childhood could be <unk> true after all
the east is rising
people in the west often talk about the emergence of india on the world stage
but that's because they don't know the history of my homeland
that for centuries india was one of the richest countries in the world until the british empire <unk> it up and left it <unk>
the british even stole the famous <unk> <unk> and stuck it on the <unk> crown
i recently read a story in the indian news magazine <unk> that mentioned a one thousand nine hundred and eighty three study of the world economy that created quite a <unk> among western <unk>
the study said that in one thousand seven hundred and fifty china owned thirty three percents of the global gdp and india twenty four point five percents
in the same year the combined share of britain and the united states was a mere two percents
a subsequent analysis found that india had the largest economy in the world for one thousand seven hundred of the past two thousand years
so to call india an emerging power is <unk>
if anything my homeland is re emerging as the global power it once was
india of course has a way to go to catch china although it has already <unk> japan as the third largest economy
opinion
why two thousand and fifteen will be a defining year for india
economic historian robert <unk> has predicted that by two thousand and forty the chinese economy will reach one hundred and twenty three dollar trillion
that's three times the economic <unk> of the entire globe and quite staggering when you consider that china was considered a poor country in two thousand
<unk> thinks china's per capita income will hit eighty five thousand dollar more than double the forecast for the european union
china's gdp at forty percents will <unk> america's fourteen percents
but some <unk> think that india has a chance to <unk> over china in about fifty years
the most recent world bank forecast says growth in india is likely to <unk> china's
granted it's a <unk> that has been made before and india has disappointed
but now with modi in the <unk> seat many experts are hopeful that india can resolve problems of political <unk> and take off like it was supposed to have done a decade ago
india says <unk> is <unk> to become another <unk> of power
india is a large country that will be population wise in the next twenty years probably <unk> china says <unk>
economy wise it'll be a rival and growing quite heavily
that's why my city <unk> in atlanta <unk> hall is visiting india
<unk> he will be there at the same time as obama
i recently spoke with hall about why he is going on the state department sponsored trip
the <unk> of the world and its economic focus has <unk> and it will continue to shift east hall told me
india is a very significant player
hall of course is interested in <unk> indian business ties with the city of atlanta home to more than one hundred thousand south asian immigrants
he says he is impressed by the <unk> middle class in india and by the fact that india is <unk> in democracy unlike china
india has the advantage of <unk> its development says hall
indians are <unk> above and beyond what was normal in the west and they have the advantage of learning from mistakes made by developed nations
they have a chance to address education poverty and <unk> care in a <unk> way says hall
<unk> emerging <unk> brings its people along the best will be the most dynamic
the human element is what people always leave out
obama says hall has every reason to reach out to modi a man who began as a <unk> <unk> a tea <unk> and became prime minister of india
that after all is the american dream realized in the land of my birth
those arrested were two <unk> of brothers interior minister <unk> fernandez <unk> told reporters saturday
what is especially <unk> with the <unk> of this cell are the many <unk> with the attacks in paris recently carried out against the charlie hebdo magazine fernandez said referring to the january seven massacre that ended with twelve dead
<unk> is a tiny seven square mile spanish <unk> <unk> morocco across the <unk> of <unk> from spain
the suspects who are spanish citizens and are of moroccan origin are strongly radicalized and had psychological and physical training as well as training in the use of weapons said the minister while addressing reporters at an event of his ruling conservative party
willing to carry out an attack fernandez said
and according to the police to blow themselves up
the <unk> image shown in a video file posted by a known isis supporter shows surviving japanese hostage kenji goto alone in <unk> and dressed in orange holding a photo of what appears to be beheaded <unk> haruna yukawa
japanese prime minister shinzo abe said sunday that the video is highly credible
u.s. authorities said they had no reason to doubt its authenticity
abe told japanese broadcaster nhk that the killing was <unk> and <unk> demanding the immediate release of goto
i still don't want to believe it <unk> yukawa said his face not shown in the report
if i can see him again i'd like to hold him in my arms
saturday's posting came four days after an isis video demanded that the japanese government pay two hundred million dollar within seventy two hours for the two hostages release
in the video released saturday the voice of a person claiming to be goto says in english that abe is to blame for yukawa's death
you were given a deadline he says
the voice then <unk> the apparent new demand from isis the release of sajida al rishawi a woman arrested in jordan in two thousand and five on suspicion of trying to take part in an attack in which others killed dozens at jordanian hotels
they no longer want money so you don't need to worry about funding terrorists the voice says
they are just demanding the release of their imprisoned sister sajida al rishawi
jordan's king abdullah ii and abe talked by phone on saturday according jordanian state news agency <unk>
the news agency did not detail what the two discussed beyond saying they reviewed the latest developments in the middle east
president barack obama condemned the purported murder of yukawa by isis
in a white house statement the president expressed condolences to the people of japan and said the united states will work with its ally to bring the perpetrators of these murders to justice and will continue to take decisive action to <unk> and ultimately defeat isis
britain's prime minister david cameron said japan was right not to bow to the terrorists demand for ransom
britain strongly supports the firm stance prime minister abe and his government have taken and we will continue to work with japan and other partners around the world to promote peace and to build a safer more secure future for our citizens cameron said in a statement
secretary of state john kerry said the u.s. is grieving with yukawa's family
america has known this pain and horror ourselves and we stand with japan not just in sadness but in solidarity and strength he said in a statement
the u.s. national security council has seen saturday's post and the intelligence community is working to confirm its authenticity <unk> deputy spokesman patrick <unk> said
goto forty seven and yukawa forty two had gone to the middle east for different reasons the former an experienced freelance journalist covering the conflict in iraq and syria and the latter an aspiring security contractor who felt at home in the war torn region
they ended up in the hands of isis in recent months
on tuesday isis released a photo showing a black clad masked man standing over goto and yukawa
the man made a demand
either japan pay two hundred million dollar the same amount that abe has proposed to help those affected by the isis campaign money his government says is for humanitarian rather than military purposes within seventy two hours or both men would die
japanese officials estimated that ultimatum <unk> at two fifty p.m. friday tokyo time with no immediate news on the hostages
saturday's video is <unk> in some ways to last year's isis videos announcing the executions of western hostages
in five isis videos last year announcing the beheadings of u.s. journalists james foley and steven sotloff british aid worker david <unk> british taxi driver alan <unk> and u.s. aid worker peter kassig a masked man is shown making a statement and sometimes putting a knife to the hostages necks
the videos then transition to a still photo of the victims <unk> heads
al rishawi the woman named in the allegedly proposed swap for goto was arrested by jordanian authorities more than nine years ago
in november two thousand and five she said in a televised confession that she tried to take part in a string of terror attacks at jordanian hotels that month that killed at least fifty seven people
she said her explosives failed to go off at a large wedding reception she was targeting but that her husband's explosives did go off there
japan isn't part of the international military coalition that for months has been carrying out airstrikes against isis targets in iraq and syria
its post world war ii constitution <unk> the use of japanese military forces for any purpose besides self defense
but tokyo is allied with the united states and others leading this military campaign
and japanese officials are offering help related to the ongoing unrest though they insist those millions of dollars would go toward things like helping refugees not killing isis militants
isis wasn't <unk>
in tuesday's video demanding ransom a masked man holding a knife stood over the kneeling goto and yukawa and said that abe <unk> volunteered to take part in this <unk> against isis
a spokesman for the terror group according to japanese broadcaster nhk wouldn't comment this week on whether his group has been in touch with the japanese government something that officials in tokyo had said they were trying to arrange
he said he was aware that japan said it wasn't involved <unk> and called the japanese <unk> for fighting with the coalition
japanese officials had said they would not yield to threats but they would do everything they could to secure the hostages safe release
would that mean paying ransom
officials weren't saying at least directly though abe did call isis demand unacceptable this week
leading japanese news organizations reported citing unidentified government sources that goto's wife received an e mail in december from someone demanding eight million dollar to sixteen million dollar for her husband's return
the government was trying to confirm if that e mail came from isis the reports said
if so it could indicate the militant group was willing to accept a smaller ransom than the two hundred million dollar it had publicly demanded
japanese citizens have been taken hostage before
some have been released
but what japan hasn't done is <unk> whether it has ever paid ransom <unk> it encourage more kidnappings in bad guy fundraising <unk>
it's not clear whether paying would have <unk>
isis doesn't have representatives or go <unk> everywhere who could <unk> such a deal
nor does it have a reputation for <unk> and <unk> so there's no telling if it would have taken the money and killed anyway
and the fact the group publicly asked for two hundred million dollar a figure well above other ransom demands raised the prospect that it was never serious about negotiating
while there are certainly geopolitical implications this story is also about two men and the families they've left behind
as the apparent deadline approached goto's mother begged for her son's life
to all members of isis kenji is not the enemy of isis
please release him the mother junko ishido said friday
i have been just crying for the last three days filled with sadness
words fail to describe how i feel
kenji always has been a kind person ever since he was little
he was always saying i want to save the lives of children in war zones
her son had been a journalist for years contributing to nhk and other japanese news organizations
goto covered big stories hoping that by telling them he could make a difference
that's what spurred him to go to isis controlled territory in syria as he explained in an october video shot shortly before he <unk> over the turkish border
syrian people suffering three years and a half
it's enough said goto forty seven
so i would like to get the story of what isis wants to do
<unk> al zaim who had worked with goto in syria previously says he warned him not to enter the isis stronghold of raqqa
i tell him it's not safe for you al zaim told cnn
but goto went anyway
he said according to al zaim i am not american i am not british
i'm japanese
i can go
the aims and activities of yukawa a forty two year old unemployed <unk> are <unk>
he originally headed to the war ravaged country early last year to gain combat and survival experience to bolster his plans to set up a private security company said his friend <unk> kimoto
there yukawa met goto who gave him insights on how to survive there kimoto said
goto also introduced him to rebel fighters who are distinct from isis though both are fighting syrian president bashar al assad's forces
some of the rebels talked about their need for ambulances to shuttle the wounded
that plea spurred yukawa to start raising money for this cause after returning to japan according to kimoto
kimoto said he advised his friend to focus on building up his private security company
before he went back to syria in july a month before his reported capture yukawa told his friend about his clear sense of purpose when he was in that <unk> middle eastern nation despite all its violence and other <unk>
i felt a chill when he said after returning home he felt in syria he was really living a life kimoto said
he seems to have felt satisfaction being there and living together with the locals
vice president joe biden was originally set to have led a delegation to saudi arabia on obama's behalf
however the schedule for the president's departure from india has been <unk> to allow obama to stop in riyadh himself on his way home white house press secretary josh earnest said
funeral services were held friday for king abdullah bin abdulaziz al <unk> who died earlier that day
he was ninety
world leaders are now traveling to the saudi capital riyadh to offer condolences for abdullah's death and pay their respects to the new ruler
abdullah was seen by many as a cautious reformer who succeeded in securing broader freedoms in the conservative kingdom but fell short in gaining greater independence for women
his successor who is seventy nine faces a number of challenges as he takes up the <unk> including iran the rise of isis the crisis in neighboring yemen and the drop in oil prices
but salman has plenty of experience to draw on having served as defense minister and deputy prime minister of saudi arabia a vital u.s. ally in the middle east
like abdullah he is one of the dozens of sons of saudi arabia's founder king abdulaziz
obama is due to arrive in new delhi on sunday on a trip intended to foster progress in sometimes <unk> u.s. india ties
on monday he will become the first american president to headline india's republic day parade standing beside indian prime minister narendra modi
why obama's trip to my homeland is meaningful
earnest said obama's schedule had been changed in coordination with the indian government and that he would now be leaving india after giving a speech on tuesday
the president <unk> that he will be unable to visit <unk> during this trip earnest said
<unk> is where the spectacular <unk> <unk> <unk> is located
biden will now remain in washington rather than go to saudi arabia
although no reason for the change of plan was given it follows criticism this month of the obama administration for its failure to send a senior representative to france for a huge unity march held in the wake of the paris terror attacks
the administration admitted it <unk> and <unk> u.s. secretary of state john kerry to paris the following week to offer the united states support and condolences
speaking to cnn's richard quest in davos switzerland on friday kerry said he expects no changes in his government's relations with saudi arabia with the change of kings
i don't <unk> anything based on the conversation we have had no he said
jordan's king abdullah and egypt's president <unk> <unk> al <unk> both left davos early to attend the funeral on friday
in line with <unk> abdullah was laid to rest in an <unk> grave in a brief and simple ceremony after funeral prayers in <unk> imam <unk> bin abdullah grand mosque
the <unk> rock band announced friday that it's <unk> seventeen shows in france germany the uk and other countries
the band hopes to resume the two thousand and fifteen turn blue tour as scheduled april two in brisbane australia
we are very sorry to have to cancel our upcoming <unk> through march ten
patrick needs time to heal co founders <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> said in a statement on the <unk> website
we thank all of our fans for their support and we're looking forward to getting back on the road
efforts to <unk> the dates were unsuccessful because of prior commitments and venue <unk> the band said
all tickets will be <unk> in full at the point of purchase
the circumstances around <unk> injury were not immediately disclosed although it was described as serious
the band had just posted a message on its site wednesday saying it will headline a festival may twenty eight in barcelona spain
formed in <unk> <unk> in two thousand and one the black keys are essentially a <unk> <unk> and <unk> although they often <unk> their live shows with other musicians
their <unk> sound <unk> built them a devoted but modest following until brothers their two thousand and ten commercial breakthrough brought a mainstream audience
the band is best known for the hits <unk> boy and gold on the ceiling from the two thousand and eleven el <unk> <unk>
they have won six <unk> and are up for three more this year including best rock <unk> for their latest turn blue
the black keys were not scheduled to perform at the <unk> awards to be handed out february eight in los angeles
they said friday that they do not expect any dates after march ten to be canceled
the black keys also are scheduled to play a handful of music festivals this summer
now as the <unk> ceasefire observed over the holidays falls apart the question is whether this latest violation of the minsk ceasefire agreement is the beginning of a separatist offensive to claim more territory
it certainly looks that way
on january thirteen the leaders of donetsk people's republic one of the two <unk> pro russian <unk> in ukraine's <unk> region issued ukrainian troops an ultimatum to surrender donetsk airport
since then the long standing <unk> control tower subject to months of shelling has finally collapsed and with it any <unk> that this conflict will stay frozen over the winter
the assault triggered a ukrainian <unk> and erupted into a full scale <unk>
ukraine's defense ministry has said it has <unk> from the main terminal at donetsk airport but it is <unk> that separatist forces only have that in their <unk> anyway
after all although the site holds symbolic value for both sides it is a <unk> ruin and of little strategic <unk>
and the leader of <unk> alexander <unk> has made clear he believes the borders of his <unk> republic should include the entire donetsk region which is double the current territory he controls
such ambitions are not likely to be realized during the freezing cold of january but separatist forces are now engaged in combat north of luhansk and as far south as mariupol
it is difficult to see russia's army sitting out on the <unk> as all this <unk> leaving the stage set for another battle between ukrainian and russian regular forces as ukraine's leadership and army are put to the test again
true the separatist force barely numbers twenty five thousand thirty thousand and only a fraction of it is combat capable
but the timing of this latest operation is clearly aimed at <unk> instability in ukraine at a moment of economic weakness rather than taking advantage of any <unk> military opportunity
ukraine's cash reserves fell to seven point five billion dollar in december while the political leadership is desperately awaiting a new <unk> of funding from the <unk> without which ukraine may soon go <unk>
meanwhile ukraine faces an incredibly difficult year due to gdp <unk> inflation currency <unk> and <unk> <unk> austerity measures
since much of its army depends on volunteer donations to survive in the field prolonged fighting will create <unk> strain on the people and the country
and despite russia's economic <unk> as well as the impact of western sanctions nothing seems to have <unk> <unk> <unk> policies in ukraine
in <unk> it is clear russia had no intention of starting this year with negotiations rather than military action to change facts on the ground
russian leaders are for their part trapped in a <unk> of their own making
they are unable to secure russian influence in ukraine through the current agreement in a manner that <unk> sanctions and <unk> separatist <unk> for a viable independent territory
ukraine's president petro poroshenko of course also <unk> domestic political support for a genuine compromise with moscow having created a coalition government with his political rival
however it is russia that struggles under sanctions and must find a way out of the current situation
and unfortunately the only way out for moscow seems to be war
for russia the minsk agreement is a dead end
the fact is that it should be for the united states as well
making russia <unk> to this agreement despite its <unk> in achieving any path to settlement in the conflict is a negotiating position that is <unk> and has run its course
the pressure of sanctions is <unk> to <unk> russia away from using force meaning that instead of a diplomatic victory the west is <unk> ukraine <unk> more territory to the separatists
another defeat will shake its political system as well
how should the west respond
the u.s. has no good choices only hard decisions to make
the first priority should be to negotiate a new ceasefire to end the bloodshed
if separatist goals are truly limited it should not take long
then the minsk agreement should be <unk> as a basis for settlement
that is far from ukraine's first choice but it is not in a position to expect best <unk> especially when its army is in retreat
meanwhile the west needs to work with russian and ukrainian leaders to come up with new terms
the framework will look similar to minsk but sanctions and economic <unk> have <unk> created strategic <unk> in moscow about the need for this conflict to end this year
plus the latest fighting will change <unk> perspective as well
if all this proves unsuccessful then there is nothing to stop western leaders from providing more weapons to ukraine or imposing new <unk> on russia
the latest fighting demonstrates the limits of what those policies might <unk> for ukraine
russia has not been brought to <unk>
it is time to try for a new peace settlement
thousands gathered in riyadh saudi arabia to pay their respects to king abdullah who died early on friday january twenty three
president abdu rabu mansour hadi's resignation thursday came after houthi rebels kidnapped his chief of staff seized control of key government buildings in the capital sanaa and failed to abide by <unk> of a tentative peace deal <unk> out wednesday
the chaos in yemen is cause for concern far beyond the country's borders
for the united states and its allies yemen's government has been a key ally in the fight against al qaeda in the arabian peninsula the yemen based group linked to attacks such as the recent slaughter at french magazine charlie hebdo
for the moment <unk> rules
beyond it <unk> the prospect of a political vacuum and growing sectarian <unk> that terror groups such as aqap could exploit
<unk> al <unk> a senior analyst at <unk> country risk told cnn that unless hadi is <unk> the chances of the country <unk> armed conflict are <unk>
our forecast is really civil war in yemen because we have a lot of <unk> armed groups who are likely to compete over territory and have a lot of competing <unk> she said
who is in charge right now really depends on where in yemen you are she said
the houthis shiite muslims who have long felt marginalized in the majority sunni country have taken control of sanaa and the northern provinces of <unk> and <unk>
but there has already been resistance to their attempted <unk> of national government institutions from different groups in yemen particularly in the south where there's a long running <unk> movement and in the oil rich province of <unk> to the east of sanaa
this really <unk> a situation where even if the houthis keep control over sanaa they have little chance of taking control of the whole country said al <unk>
we expect to see armed resistance
it's possible that hadi himself a <unk> could <unk> his resignation and put a gulf cooperation council initiative for a <unk> transition of power back on track
but that seems unlikely at present
according to the national news agency <unk> yemen's parliament is due to hold an extraordinary session sunday called by parliament speaker <unk> al <unk>
analysts suggest that because there's no vice president the speaker could be next in the line of succession taking on the role of acting president
he's close to former president ali abdullah saleh who <unk> to power until being forced out by international pressure two years ago
despite their <unk> of sanaa it's unclear whether the houthis really want to take charge of the country
the group more likely wanted hadi to remain in power as a <unk> behind whom they could pull the <unk> without having to take on the <unk> business of governance said al <unk>
under wednesday's failed peace deal the hadi government had agreed to <unk> parts of the country's constitution to give the houthis more political power in return for them <unk> their militias from key government institutions and <unk> the president's kidnapped aide
the government only finally got parliamentary approval in december said u.s. based yemen analyst <unk> al <unk>
hadi's resignation seems to be a recognition of the fact that he won't be able to lead the country as he wishes because of the houthi <unk> she said
the houthis are <unk> from northern yemen who make up about thirty percents of the population
they've been at war with the central government for the best part of a decade and are also fighting the sunni aqap
at the beginning of two thousand and fourteen they won a series of battles close to the saudi border
and in september houthi fighters suddenly <unk> on sanaa where they took over government buildings the main airport and a share of power
in the past week they've taken it to another level
although they have been fighting aqap they are no friend to the united states
one of the main <unk> of this historically iranian backed group is death to america
the houthis have more recently <unk> an alliance with supporters of former president saleh said al <unk>
this <unk> the houthis <unk> expansion but the alliance is <unk> she said not least because saleh in the past <unk> military campaigns against the houthis
al qaeda's yemen affiliate aqap is perhaps the best known group internationally
it first emerged in saudi arabia in two thousand and two but thanks to the efforts of saudi authorities was a mostly a spent force by two thousand and five according to analysis from <unk> world insurgency and terrorism
it re emerged <unk> in yemen in two thousand and nine after the saudi <unk> <unk> with a yemeni al qaeda <unk>
besides battling the yemeni government and houthis it has been involved in international terror attacks including the failed two thousand and nine attempt to bring down an airliner over detroit
the muslim brotherhood is also a powerful group in yemen in the shape of the al <unk> party and is well represented in the <unk> government
it <unk> the houthis and has its own militias
the fighting in yemen also provides an opening to isis which is keen to <unk> al qaeda and prove itself the true <unk> of the faith
in november isis leader abu bakr al baghdadi called on yemeni <unk> to resist the houthis
there are also a number of heavily armed rural tribes that will fight for control over their territories
while in power hadi and the government of prime minister khaled bahah have been trying to fight aqap on the ground and also have authorized u.s. drone strikes in the country against terror targets
as part of those efforts the united states has several hundred american diplomats and military personnel in yemen
but the u.s. embassy has been on reduced <unk> since september
the houthis have publicly said they oppose u.s. drone strikes and u.s. involvement in yemen
there are currently no talks with the houthis but there are discussions about whether to talk to them according to u.s. officials
multiple policy options are being considered the officials said though there is no consensus yet about how to <unk>
the safety and security of u.s. personnel is our top priority in yemen u.s. state department spokeswoman <unk> <unk> said
we are <unk> the security situation on the ground on an ongoing basis
we call on all parties to abide by their public commitments to ensure the security of the diplomatic community including our personnel
al <unk> the yemen analyst said she didn't see an immediate need to pull u.s. personnel out of yemen
i think yemen is safe at the time being she told cnn's wolf <unk>
the houthis have been in charge for a while
they have popular <unk> all over the capital of sanaa and they've been running the security show
i do however want to say that the americans might need to start talking to the houthis
and if the americans are talking to iran in back channels they need to do the same with the houthis
since hadi's resignation there has been a lot of anger against the houthis in parts of the country said al <unk> the <unk> country risk analyst
while hadi wasn't able to <unk> the country while in power she said since the houthi <unk> of sanaa he has become the popular symbol of anti houthi sentiment across southern and central yemen
many there are calling for his return she said
a chief <unk> for popular anger may be the central <unk> province she said
there have already been some low level <unk> and tribes are <unk> in the area
large scale protests have also been seen in aden the main <unk> in the country's south where the current chaos plays into the hands of the <unk> movement
seven things to know about yemen
we started our foundation in two thousand with the idea that by backing innovative work in health and education we could help billions of people improve their lives
the progress we've seen so far is so exciting that we are <unk> down on the bet we made fifteen years ago
here's our bet
the lives of people in poor countries will improve faster in the next fifteen years than at any other time in history
we're putting our credibility time and money behind this bet because we think there has never been a better time to <unk> progress and have a big impact around the world
here are four big <unk> we see coming by two thousand and thirty
first child deaths will go down by half
in one thousand nine hundred and ninety one in ten children in the world died before age five
today it's one in twenty
by two thousand and thirty it will be one in forty
almost all countries will include vaccines for <unk> and <unk> two of the biggest killers of children in their <unk> programs
better sanitation will cut the spread of disease dramatically
and we're learning how to help more mothers <unk> practices such as proper <unk> and skin to skin contact with their babies that prevent <unk> from dying in the first month after they're born
second africa will be able to feed itself
today the continent has to rely on imports and food aid to feed its people even though seven out of ten people in sub <unk> africa are farmers
part of the problem is that african farmers get just a fraction of the <unk> that american farmers get
in the next fifteen years however innovations in farming will erase these brutal <unk>
with better <unk> and <unk> crops african farmers will be able to grow a greater variety of food and sell their <unk> to <unk> their family's <unk> with vegetables eggs milk and meat
even as climate change makes farmers job more difficult we can get them enough innovation and information to increase <unk> by fifty percents for the continent overall
countries like ghana are also building better roads and <unk> policies that make it easier to move food to the places where it's most needed
in fifteen years africa will still import food when it makes sense to do so but it will also export much more eventually achieving a net positive trade balance
third mobile banking will help the poor <unk> transform their lives
today some two point five billion people don't have access to cheap and easy financial services a problem that makes it much more difficult to be poor
if your savings is in the form of jewelry or <unk> for example you can't very well <unk> off tiny pieces to cover routine daily <unk>
but in the next fifteen years digital banking will give the poor more control over their assets
the key will be mobile phones
already in developing countries with the right <unk> framework such as bangladesh people are using their phones to store money <unk> and make <unk>
by two thousand and thirty eight percents of the adults without bank accounts today will be doing the same
and by then mobile money <unk> will be offering the full range of financial services from interest bearing savings accounts to credit to <unk>
fourth as high speed cell networks grow and <unk> become as cheap as today's voice only phones online education will flourish
before a child even starts primary school she will be able to use her <unk> smartphone to learn her numbers and letters
software will be able to see when she's having trouble with the material and <unk> for her pace
of course software will never replace teachers
but by allowing teachers to do things like <unk> videos of themselves and get feedback from their <unk> it can connect them in new ways
what will it take to make sure life really does improve faster for the poor
we need advances in technology and we need to deliver them to the people who need them most
we also need to close the gender gap
countries where girls don't go to school or women can't open a business will be left behind
another crucial factor will be people who care about helping those in the world's poorest places improve their lives
we're <unk> to recruit millions of new advocates we're calling them global citizens to urge world leaders to be ambitious when they meet in september to <unk> a new set of goals that will guide the world's efforts to tackle disease poverty and climate change for the next fifteen years
beyond two thousand and fifteen we hope these global citizens will hold governments and other decision makers accountable for meeting those goals
you can show your support by signing up at <unk> dot <unk> where you can learn how to get engaged and connect with other organizations working to make two thousand and fifteen a historic year
we believe that informed passionate people can work together to make the world a more <unk> place
in fact we're <unk> on it
king salman has taken over as the leader of saudi arabia following the death of his brother king abdullah
the miss universe contest turned out some <unk> eye catching costumes from <unk> participating in the show
but diarra raised by immigrants from mali in the paris suburb of <unk> <unk> says it's as if her neighborhood is <unk> across her <unk>
it's hard to dream when everyone says the place you come from only <unk> jihadists terrorists and <unk> the twenty one year old says
you end up feeling completely isolated
<unk> <unk> is just one of the many banlieues heavily immigrant working class suburbs dotted around the <unk> of the french capital
but its close <unk> to grigny has made the neighborhood <unk> with violence and failure
grigny is the <unk> of amedy coulibaly who killed a policewoman as well as four hostages at a kosher supermarket in paris two weeks ago
his associates said and cherif kouachi slaughtered twelve more at the office of the satirical magazine charlie hebdo
together they are the worst terror attacks in france in decades
<unk> concerns were exacerbated this week when french prime minister manuel valls declared that there was a <unk> social and ethnic apartheid that had developed in france
she believes the use of provocative language only further <unk> the people living in the banlieues
diarra says that the past two weeks have attracted a relentless and <unk> media spotlight on <unk> <unk> with journalists <unk> en <unk> and filming from their cars for fear of being assaulted or having their equipment stolen
the negative press has <unk> up many <unk> and cultural <unk> that diarra has spent most of her young life fighting to <unk> ever since the two thousand and five <unk> that left thousands of cars burnt in the paris region thousands arrested and millions more <unk> across france
yes we need better education and yes <unk> exists in these towns but the government <unk> us all with the same brush
you stop feeling like an individual and begin to think you're reduced to a crime ridden town diarra says
diarra believes the media <unk> certain <unk> about towns like <unk> especially the one about how banlieues are full of bad <unk>
it's a sentiment shared by coulibaly's sister <unk> coulibaly now a successful <unk> who reflected on the two thousand and five <unk> in a two thousand and nine interview with the san <unk> <unk>
when you are in the projects they want you to shut your mouth to stay here to grow up <unk>
for me the way that people in the projects are portrayed so <unk> in the media really hurt me a lot <unk> told the paper
but <unk> rio the mayor of grigny is trying to <unk> this image of banlieues as crime <unk> <unk>
rio grew up in the concrete <unk> that is the <unk> borne the same housing project as coulibaly
rio says it's easy to <unk> the success stories of the banlieues in favor of <unk> of <unk> terrorists but that not everyone from his town is a criminal
grigny was home to a professional football player an actress even a <unk> chef who now works in hong kong he says
these are all very successful people
in the same breath the mayor admits that his town faces grave economic problems
forty <unk> of <unk> borne residents aged sixteen twenty five are unemployed
the average net annual income in grigny is nine thousand six hundred euros according to rio the lowest in the paris region
these factors make it very difficult for those who live in the area to feel like they're part of society the mayor says
rio has been waging a campaign to get a fully <unk> police station for the <unk> thirty thousand <unk>
but the interior ministry has yet to grant his wish
the mayor also believes that better education will help bridge the gap between the banlieues and the state the us and them <unk>
eric <unk> a <unk> in the eastern parisian suburb of <unk> <unk> <unk> has a class largely made up of second and third generation immigrant children
a man with a calm <unk> he believes opening a dialogue with his students on the theme of identity in france is crucial to helping his students find their place within the state
his main worry is what happens when they leave school and begin job hunting
because they struggle to find a job they feel <unk> <unk> and suddenly these young adults can't find their role in the <unk> and therefore they create their own communities he says
de charles <unk> aka was amedy coulibaly's social worker
his small office in <unk> borne is <unk> with photos of smiling children that he has helped guide into <unk>
aka believes one of the reasons coulibaly might have formed a relationship with <unk> criminals when he was in jail was because he didn't fit into life outside the prison walls despite desperately wanting to be part of a community
coulibaly had a big problem with identity he was lost
and prison offered him some bad examples to follow aka says
coulibaly's cousin <unk> agrees
he <unk> a bunch of <unk> and became himself an idiot <unk> told french radio <unk>
he did not hate jews christians it's the state he <unk>
connecting the <unk> youth to the state through job creation is what <unk> el <unk> has dedicated the last six years to
the business he founded the agency for diversity in entrepreneurship <unk> to reveal the <unk> potential of doing business with <unk> entrepreneurs in marginalized neighborhoods
el <unk> says the negative <unk> surrounding the banlieues means companies shy away from recruiting there and in turn this further <unk> the people of these towns
we feel like we're alone and when we talk about the banlieues we only talk about its problems and never about the opportunity the banlieues represent today el <unk> says
that is crucial to bringing everyone together
in the meantime <unk> diarra is hoping opportunity will come <unk> as she <unk> an <unk> this summer
her dream is a career in journalism but she knows that ambition alone may not be enough
to have a future you need to believe in yourself but you also need others to believe in you she says
in a much <unk> speech in davos at a reception at the world economic forum the resilient royal reiterated and <unk> the <unk> <unk> made by buckingham palace issued on his behalf over accusations that he was repeatedly <unk> with an alleged <unk> sex slave
andrew still fifth in line to the british throne and queen elizabeth <unk> second son carefully and <unk> avoided <unk> the name virginia roberts the woman at the center of the <unk> claims
he also did not repeat the specific allegations made against him
for the record those allegations are that miss roberts now thirty one was <unk> to be used as an <unk> <unk> and was forced to <unk> service the prince who she knew as andy by her wealthy boss <unk> and convicted sex <unk> jeffrey epstein
she says she was seventeen years old at the time of her first encounter with prince andrew which is under the legal age of <unk> in florida
she claims in court papers that <unk> scotland yard protection officers left her alone with him the first time he had sex with her and that she was later involved in an <unk> with the prince and approximately eight other girls
five photos were also submitted including one which miss roberts said showed her aged fifteen when she says she began working as a sex slave for epstein
she insists she is telling the truth and wants prince andrew to repeat his <unk> on oath
in his for the record speech prince andrew stressed my focus is on my work
it has prompted some to ask what exactly is it that the duke of york does and what is the point of him
since his association with convicted sex <unk> <unk> epstein forced the duke to accept a <unk> of his role as a uk trade envoy in two thousand and eleven he has been busy trying to <unk> out a new role for himself
he has continued to support business in the uk but without a <unk> role as before
in recent months many high ranking figures at buckingham palace believed was on the right track and making progress in achieving that new role
i have witnessed personally what a good no <unk> <unk> andrew is at events he has inspired and hosted
he is particularly passionate when dealing with young start up entrepreneurs and bringing them together with successful businesses at <unk> and <unk> events
andrew is direct and to the point and his methods seem to work
there is no doubt he is passionate about these issues and before this sex scandal blew up in his face he was making a good <unk> of it
as he said in his davos speech but went widely <unk> as his sound bite about the sex allegations took all the attention
i focus on inspiring young people to develop skills to enable them to become economically active and encouraging a culture of enterprise and entrepreneurship
two of the important initiatives he has inspired are the digital enterprise awards referred to as idea which he is working with the <unk> trust to deliver
this is about to engage and to inspire young people to get not only digital skills but enterprise skills and to expand their knowledge in the digital universe
so far in year one about ten thousand young people are engaged in the program
his second big project is pitch palace a bid to support start up businesses
in two thousand and fourteen the duke launched pitch palace and held two <unk> pitch events at st <unk> palace worked with seventy six entrepreneurs from across the uk
each event was attended by around four hundred invited investors <unk> and supporters
on the day <unk> was trending four th in the uk on twitter
since then more than seven hundred connections made between the entrepreneurs and the audience
some results for the entrepreneurs featured include
financial <unk> <unk> <unk> which has raised five hundred <unk> hired four new employees and received media coverage on cnn and other major media outlets
andrew argues <unk> that entrepreneurs need more than just money
they need business partners they need <unk> they need customers and they need network and of course investors
essentially his new role is all about assisting the economic success of and the creation of skilled jobs in the uk
his efforts focus on three core areas where he believes he can have the greatest impact
education and skills promoting <unk> as a <unk> path to a career is one of his big issues
he is patron of the studio schools trust and the <unk> <unk> educational trust among others
last year he visited nine university technical <unk> and studio schools as well as twenty four other educational projects or institutions <unk> with in excess of five thousand students and <unk>
entrepreneurship is his second core focus encouraging entrepreneurship in the uk supporting current start ups and efforts to develop a culture of enterprise
<unk> supporting science technology and engineering promoting expertise in these areas which attract investment into uk and promoting the further translation of science into business
he has also been key in <unk> the work of the uk technology industry and <unk>
last month he hosted the duke of york award for technical education at st <unk> palace to celebrate the achievements of students in university technical <unk> across the united kingdom
there is no doubt this work is all highly <unk>
but it is not his work life that is under scrutiny but his judgment
but if prince andrew hopes his unprecedented move to speak out publicly about his private life will draw a line under the scandal he is mistaken
why
because there are still simply too many unanswered questions about his role in the scandal <unk> him
not least what was the nature of his relationship with epstein a man convicted of <unk> <unk> woman for prostitution why did he visit him after he was released from prison and what was the nature of his association with virginia roberts who he was photographed with when she says she was a teenager
this combined with the fact the ongoing civil court case in the u.s. against epstein and three women could just keep turning up new <unk> allegations about the duke
however it is important to remember the prince is not facing legal proceedings over the u.s. claims
he has simply been named in court papers
he has not done anything illegal until someone proves he has
to date he has not been charged with anything either
it may be <unk> for the media to show a measure of <unk> and restraint when reporting allegations that are no matter how <unk> and good copy after all just that allegations
the only way perhaps andrew can hope to move on is by giving a detailed <unk> of all the allegations that have been made against him in a sworn <unk>
the <unk> clock is a <unk> recognized <unk> of the world's <unk> to catastrophe from nuclear weapons climate change and other emerging global threats
although it may be easier to think out of sight out of mind the bulletin has been <unk> us since one thousand nine hundred and forty seven that nuclear weapons remain a grave threat to the survival of humanity
the original setting was seven minutes to midnight and now we've allowed our world to <unk> to a setting of three minutes to midnight not seen since one thousand nine hundred and eighty four during one of the most dangerous <unk> of the cold war
there are still sixteen thousand three hundred nuclear weapons in the world many on high alert able to be launched in less than fifteen minutes
there can be no meaningful medical or humanitarian response to a nuclear attack whether it is planned or <unk>
<unk> <unk> low <unk> and security <unk> that put us all at risk have <unk> america's nuclear military forces
according to eric <unk> author of command and control there were more than one thousand <unk> involving our nuclear <unk> from one thousand nine hundred and fifty one thousand nine hundred and sixty eight
and who knows what hair raising incidents have happened involving foreign <unk>
our nuclear security <unk> not to depend on good luck continuing <unk>
the setting of the <unk> clock also addresses the vast scale of the danger
recent research published by <unk> for social responsibility indicates that even a limited regional nuclear war say between india and pakistan would have profound health <unk> on all of us
if one hundred <unk> size weapons were used in such a war the <unk> effects would have a devastating impact on world agriculture and put two billion people at risk of starving
it has become self evident that these weapons have no military <unk> and are too dangerous to keep around
we can change this
recently a dynamic worldwide movement of people and governments has shown a renewed interest in nuclear <unk>
in october one hundred and fifty five of the world's governments representing seventy nine percents of the nations of the world supported a u.n. resolution calling for the elimination of nuclear weapons
in a powerful personal message last month to the <unk> conference on the humanitarian impact of nuclear weapons pope francis declared that nuclear weapons are a global problem <unk> all nations and <unk> future generations and the planet that is our home
a global <unk> is needed if we are to reduce the nuclear threat and work towards nuclear <unk>
he went on to say i am convinced that the desire for peace and <unk> <unk> deep in the human heart will bear <unk> in concrete ways to ensure that nuclear weapons are banned once and for all to the benefit of our common home
president barack obama promised to pursue a world free of nuclear weapons but his administration must not have gotten the <unk>
the current plan involves spending three hundred and fifty five billion dollar over the next ten years to maintain and <unk> our nuclear <unk> and one dollar trillion over the next thirty years
this is an <unk> waste of <unk> dollars on weapons that must never be used
the time has come for the united states in words and <unk> to support the global elimination of nuclear weapons
the <unk> of the clock was also influenced by the report that last year was the <unk> ever recorded on earth
this <unk> scientific warnings that the relentless warming of our planet poses profound long term risks to civilization and to the natural world
unless we change our behavior worsening climate change will continue to <unk> affect public health from heat related <unk> worsening respiratory problems such as <unk> and <unk> more infectious diseases crop failure from drought or flooding with resulting <unk> to mental health <unk> such as post traumatic stress <unk> and <unk>
our political leaders have a moral obligation to our children grandchildren and future generations to leave them a planet free of nuclear weapons and a planet that is not damaged beyond <unk> by the <unk> of climate change
since we're attacking there is no sense to have peace talks now <unk> <unk> leader of the self proclaimed people's republic of donetsk said in a meeting with university students according to his media office
we've made this mistake before
it's not <unk> to repeat it he said
thousands have been killed in months of conflict between the rebels and ukrainian troops and a ceasefire agreed to in september <unk> long ago
<unk> comments came two days after the foreign ministers of ukraine and russia met in berlin to discuss a way out of the violence
but <unk> showed no interest in the talks
there will be no attempts from our side to talk about the ceasefire he said reported russian state news agency <unk>
we will be on the offensive until we reach the border of donetsk region
he said that he was interested in cooperating with ukraine on prisoner <unk>
we need to get our guys who've been captured he said according to <unk>
despite the talks in berlin violence in the <unk> donetsk and luhansk regions in eastern ukraine shows no signs of <unk>
power is out in and around luhansk after militants <unk> a power plant there luhansk regional official <unk> <unk> told ukraine's state run ukrinform news agency
<unk> noted that the local water supply and <unk> are off and <unk> buses aren't operating
thursday's shelling of a transit stop in donetsk city an attack that ukraine's defense ministry blamed on rebels killed eight civilians according to state news reports
but ukrainian troops have come under heavy fire as well
that includes one hundred and fifteen attacks in a recent twenty four hour period that killed three troops and wounded fifty more ukrinform reported friday
the news agency said that russian terrorist troops faced off with ukrainian soldiers thursday along <unk> highway even posting a picture that showed a man with <unk> on his clothing suggesting that he was part of the russian military
this is in line with <unk> repeated <unk> that russia has not only actively supported rebels with arms but has sent its own troops across the border to battle ukrainian forces
on wednesday for instance ukrainian president petro poroshenko said that more than nine thousand russian troops our russian ukrainian border bring with them hundreds and hundreds of tanks armed personnel carriers and killing ukrainian civilians and attacking ukrainian troops
russian foreign minister sergey lavrov <unk> responded to this assertion with a firm denial much like other <unk> made by russian officials in recent months over similar allegations of armed intervention
as to the flow of troops and <unk> this is not the first time we hear something like that he said
and each time i hear that i say if you're so confident about that please present us with facts but no one has been able to provide us with these facts
pro russian separatists have claimed control of parts of eastern ukraine since the spring of two thousand and fourteen despite a push by ukrainian forces to defeat them
from mid april to january twenty one the conflict had killed at least five thousand and eighty six people and injured at least ten thousand nine hundred and forty eight others said the united nations
we fear that the real figure may be <unk> higher the office of the u.n. high commissioner for human rights said about the death toll in a report released friday
at least two hundred and sixty two people were killed in the fighting from january thirteen through wednesday alone the report said
unrest in ukraine began with protests in the country's capital last year after president <unk> <unk> <unk> closer ties to russia dropped plans to sign a political and economic agreement with the european union
after months of protests and days of deadly clashes between demonstrators and security personnel in kiev parliament ousted <unk> in february
weeks later russia annexed the <unk> peninsula
then in april violence broke out in two ukrainian regions that border russia donetsk and luhansk as separatist leaders declared independence from the government in kiev
using the resting <unk> as a backdrop sola draws swift <unk> in the air with the light <unk>
thirty seconds later the camera <unk> <unk> and the light artist <unk> his <unk> disappearing once more into the night
welcome to the elusive magical world of <unk>
sola is the street artist <unk> <unk> of forty year old photographer peter <unk> who has been capturing the urban landscape of birmingham streets since shortly after <unk> there in two thousand
much of the city had become ex industrial space and sola recalls how upon first <unk> the city seemed somewhat run down
but a chance late night shoot revealed the <unk> nature of <unk> on the city
what were once dead spaces became a <unk> stage for the photographer to <unk>
meeting in the heart of the city's creative quarter sola <unk> me <unk> before <unk> a coffee and sitting down
dressed <unk> in a <unk> <unk> and <unk> his face lights up with enthusiasm as he begins to explain the art of <unk>
<unk> is long exposure photography where the artist draws intricate designs patterns or words using hand held lights in front of a camera in pitch black darkness
while many artists around the world <unk> with long exposure photography and light art sola <unk> the term <unk>
it's me the <unk> and the <unk> he says <unk>
to the average casual <unk> who just happens to come across me i look like a complete <unk>
i'm in the street waving a <unk> around
it's so dark you can't see my camera ninety percents of the time
and you're looking at this <unk> running around thinking what the hell is going on
his technique <unk> elements from graffiti including bombing where the artist gets to a location does the work and is gone
<unk> physical process <unk> mere seconds and leaves a continuous <unk> stroke on the final photograph as if by magic
it's like drawing on the page and when i move the light in front of a camera it leaves that mark
if you go faster it leaves a <unk> mark and if you go slower it leaves a <unk> mark explains the artist
then for just a brief moment <unk> face becomes <unk>
although striking and <unk> to see <unk> isn't some <unk> <unk>
explaining his <unk> <unk> voice is filled with passion for his work as he <unk> that what you see is what he shoots
he's <unk> that the camera should capture the moment and only permits himself to <unk> the photographs in as much as a <unk> would allow
i never <unk> my photos
you should shoot it for real he says
when i grew up with film you had to make it in the camera
there was no <unk> around
you couldn't do much afterwards in post <unk>
yet some of the most iconic imagery of all time was shot on film and very little <unk> with a brush afterwards on the print
i think there is something important about that
he adds
i very <unk> don't shoot under direct light
i don't hang around
i don't wear bright clothing
i wish i wore some crazy <unk> <unk> suit or something
i'm not going to get arrested
often he will spend weeks <unk> the perfect location for his latest collection
and while he's always eager to find a new space he says he has no desire to be arrested
as long as i don't break anything to get in i'm not forcing entry
if there is a <unk> down there's a <unk> down
i'm just <unk> around
by and large it is never my intention to <unk>
i'm walking around and if there is a way into a space i might use it
the popularity of <unk> light art has offered the photographer some exciting opportunities in the last few years including working with commercial partners such as <unk> for ad campaigns and traveling to dubai for a three week <unk> with local artists
he has also shot scenes in the british countryside and during the <unk> annual music festival
using the city as his playground he never <unk> to the same location twice explaining that he thinks it helps keep his work fresh
but just for once tonight he has driven me to an abandoned car park he recently shot at
as he <unk> <unk> his <unk> and snaps his camera in to place sola claims anyone can <unk> his method all you need is a light source and a camera
the first few i did were with road safety maintenance lights that you have in your car
you can use anything you could use your phone
you can use anything that has got a light
i use certain items i'm not a <unk> but they are my <unk> and also my <unk> tools as well
different ones do different things
different <unk> go onto them and to help me realize what i need that light form to do
after a few test shots to check the light and <unk> of the <unk> rooftop he turns on a meter long light bar with what looks like purple transparency paper <unk> to one side and begins moving in front of the camera
i'm working out which <unk> to make and where to put them in order to achieve what i want to do
so again there's little <unk>
the <unk> of what you expect it to be are out he says
by using <unk> and basically taking maximum advantage of the camera and tools at hand to shift the <unk> i think that's when you start to take it away from being real
it takes into a sort of wonderful <unk> element
and how long does it take for sola to create these <unk> light sculptures
rather <unk> he <unk>
about six minutes
in out shoot
get back in the car
as he comes back to the camera to check each shot sola describes how it is quite <unk> to work late into the night and how he often falls into a <unk> like state while designing his pieces
but while he <unk> <unk> about the <unk> beauty of a <unk> city he's also quick to remind me of the ever present danger
you're on your own from a safety perspective and it is an expensive camera bag that i'd quite like to keep hold of
it can lead to some <unk> moments
i'm pretty much fast enough to get gone
i try to shoot wherever possible near to my car
most of the time when anyone even <unk> <unk> gets close enough you show them what you're doing and they are so blown away by it that you <unk> the situation
while he is open to sharing his techniques with the world this <unk> <unk> of light rarely features himself in his work <unk> to let the photographs speak for themselves
i just want to inspire people with my work
if someone can look at a piece and be excited inspired moved in any way shape or form then i'm happy job done
because there is not enough of that in life
and there's too much art
this is why i strip away the <unk> stuff
it's there and i could sit and <unk> about it but no one wants to hear that really
everyone can get something different from it
it keeps it accessible to people
despite the near freezing temperatures out on city streets tonight hours fly by as we move from location to location
finally after one last shot sola makes his way back to the camera <unk> at the screen and <unk> he's ready to call it a night
as he <unk> his <unk> and <unk> the legs back into the locked position i ask him where he wants to take the moving art form next
a lot of my work is very <unk> he says
a lot of my work has that magical element that <unk> thing but sometimes there is not enough <unk> to it
the <unk> campaign was a starting point
but i'd like to up the game essentially high end fashion
do beautiful work with more people in them
i love the <unk> work but for my heart need to shoot with people

on tuesday isis released a video threatening to kill the two men kenji goto and haruna yukawa unless japan paid the group two hundred million dollar within seventy two hours
based on the time frame the japanese government estimated that the ultimatum <unk> at two fifty p.m. friday tokyo time and <unk> to secure the men's release
hours before the estimated deadline an isis spokesman told japanese broadcaster nhk that the group would release a statement soon about the hostages
that statement didn't come
when asked whether isis has been in negotiations with the japanese government the spokesman told nhk he wouldn't comment
isis claims the ransom amount is the same as the financial aid pledged by japanese prime minister shinzo abe to countries affected by the militant group
japanese officials have repeatedly stressed that their military which is <unk> forbidden from taking action other than for self defense isn't involved in the international airstrikes against isis positions in syria and iraq
the abe pledge is for humanitarian purposes like helping refugees not military purposes japan says
in his communication with nhk the isis spokesman said the group is aware of what japan says and then he went on to call the japanese <unk> for fighting with the group
it says it's doing its best to communicate with isis
it wants to secure the hostages safe release but it won't yield to threats
japanese chief cabinet secretary <unk> suga said he was aware of reports that isis would soon make a statement
we are receiving many different pieces of information but as a government we can not really comment as to whether that information is authentic he said
caught in the middle are the two men goto and yukawa
as the apparent deadline approached goto's mother begged for her son's life
to all members of isis kenji is not the enemy of isis
please release him said the mother junko ishido
there is so little time left before the deadline
i have been just crying for the last three days filled with sadness
words fail to describe how i feel
kenji always has been a kind person ever since he was little
he was always saying i want to save the lives of children in war zones
leading japanese news organizations have reported citing unidentified government sources that goto's wife got an email in december from someone demanding eight million dollar to sixteen million dollar for her husband's return
the government is trying to confirm if that email came from isis the reports said
if so it could indicate the militant group is willing to accept a smaller ransom than the two hundred million dollar it had publicly demanded
but the question is what if anything japan is willing to give
isis has a ruthless track record
it has released videos <unk> the killing of five western hostages since august
abe has called isis ultimatum over the two japanese men's lives unacceptable and said the international community shouldn't give in to terrorists
but he and other government officials haven't explicitly ruled out paying a ransom
some details have emerged about what spurred the two japanese citizens to travel thousands of miles to the bloody syrian conflict
while they had different <unk> the two men knew and talked to each other said yukawa's friend <unk> kimoto
goto an experienced freelance journalist made a video in october near the turkish syrian border before he <unk> on a <unk> journey into isis controlled territory
it is my responsibility if something happens he explained
goto forty seven said he was determined to cover what was happening in the region
syrian people suffering three years and a half
it's enough he said
so i would like to get the story of what isis wants to do
<unk> al zaim who had worked with goto in syria previously says he warned him not to enter the isis stronghold of raqqa
i tell him it's not safe for you al zaim told cnn
but goto chose to go anyway saying i am not american i am not british
i'm japanese
i can go al zaim recalled
the aims and activities in syria of yukawa a forty two year old unemployed <unk> are <unk>
he originally headed to the war ravaged country early last year with the aim of gaining combat and survival experience to bolster his plans to set up a private security company said his friend kimoto
there yukawa met goto who gave him insights on how to survive there kimoto said
he also introduced him to rebel fighters who are distinct from isis even though both are fighting against syrian president bashar al assad's forces
some of the rebels talked about their need for ambulances to shuttle the wounded
that plea spurred yukawa to start raising money for this cause after returning to japan according to kimoto
i felt a chill when he said after returning home he felt in syria he was really living a life kimoto said
he seems to have felt satisfaction being there and living together with the locals
yukawa went back to syria in july a trip that kimoto said he didn't know about at the time
kimoto said he had advised his friend to focus on building up his private security company
opinion
why countries should think about paying ransoms

<unk> <unk> and <unk> gathered outside the <unk> train station as a series of individual <unk> identity numbers their offenses and amounts of outstanding court fines <unk> across a massive electronic <unk> one after the other as shown on chinese state television
instead of <unk> <unk> it serves as a public wall of shame for those that failed to pay court ordered fines for violating property <unk> laws <unk> court orders or failing to respond to <unk>
the amount of outstanding fines range from ten thousand yuan up to twenty nine million yuan
wang <unk> a court official told <unk> city's largest newspaper <unk> morning post on wednesday that it was part of a campaign in the new year to <unk> up policy implementation measures
wang added that it was doing a public service by <unk> the details
according to chinese supreme court regulations it is legal for local courts to publish private information of people or organizations who have <unk> court orders
the advertising agency that manages the <unk> confirmed with cnn that the court has authorized them to publish personal details of the individuals and companies for two weeks until they pay off their <unk>
as of today we have taken down information of one company and two individuals because they have settled their <unk> with the courts said <unk> kai general manager of <unk> <unk> advertising company
he added that they did not charge the courts for any advertising fees in support of the court's decision to force <unk> to pay
for now the public also seems to support the court's <unk> tactics
now those people who are <unk> have nowhere to hide and <unk> not do it again zhou <unk> a man standing outside the railway station told <unk> tv a local channel
the court has played <unk> by <unk> these <unk> well done
one <unk> told local media
it involves an investigation into the deadliest terror attack in argentina's history modern <unk> alleged <unk> a <unk> death and a <unk> of <unk>
if you are <unk> with the story
last week a special prosecutor investigating the one thousand nine hundred and ninety four bombing of a jewish community center in buenos aires filed a report alleging that the president foreign minister and other officials <unk> to cover up iran's involvement in the attack which killed eighty five
the prosecutor <unk> nisman was invited to testify about his allegations before congress on monday
but on the eve of his testimony nisman was found dead inside his apartment
he died of a gunshot wound to the temple
a gun and a shell <unk> were found near his body
the apartment was locked from the inside
at first glance a suicide
but the <unk> death raised <unk> immediately
a poll by the firm <unk> of more than four hundred <unk> found that seventy percents of them believed that nisman was murdered
some eighteen percents believed he took his own life and twelve percents didn't have an opinion
in a statement she called it the suicide was not a suicide
it is an about face from her position just days before
her first statement on nisman's death was a <unk> of the prosecutor's allegations and a reflection on what was it that led a person to make the terrible decision to take his own life
two things happened after that
the prosecutor looking into nisman's death said that no gunpowder <unk> was found on his hands as would be likely if he pulled the <unk>
second the <unk> who helped nisman's mother gain access into the apartment cast doubt on reports that the door could have been opened only from inside
to the contrary someone could have gained entry with something as simple as a wire the <unk> said
anybody could have opened it he told a <unk> of reporters after giving a statement to investigators
while fernandez now considers that nisman did not commit suicide she still believes that his allegations against her government are false
nisman was not a hack with an agenda against the president but a <unk> investigator who was used by others who fed him false information fernandez said
the criminal complaint by prosecutor nisman was never in itself the true plot against the government fernandez wrote
his report <unk> like a house of cards she wrote and nisman probably never knew he was being fed false information
the real plot against the government was his death which came after he accused her government of a cover up to protect iranian suspects in the bombing fernandez wrote
they used him while he was alive and then they needed him dead she wrote
it's that sad and terrible
nisman's report promised to provide evidence of the existence of a sophisticated criminal plot deliberately <unk> to cover up and provide impunity to the iranians accused in the investigation of the attack of the jewish community center in one thousand nine hundred and ninety four
less than forty eight hours after nisman's body was found the court that had received the criminal complaint published the entire document on the internet
traffic was so heavy that the website hosting the document crashed for a while
the two hundred and eighty nine page report makes its case based on <unk> telephone conversations between representatives of argentina and iran and <unk> that the south american nation agreed to stop pursuing the named iranian suspects in the bombing in exchange for an oil for grain and meat deal with iran
a little background
in two thousand and seven argentina requested the arrest of several iranians in connection with the one thousand nine hundred and ninety four bombing including former defense minister ahmad <unk>
interpol approved so called red notices for these suspects <unk> countries around the world of buenos aires desire to have them arrested
according to nisman's report representatives on <unk> behalf held both secret and public meetings where it was agreed that the trade deal could be reached if the red notices were <unk>
it was a geopolitical move to <unk> argentina's economic position at the cost of <unk> justice in the bombing of the argentine <unk> mutual association building according to nisman
intercepted phone calls between representatives of both countries show that there was a conspiracy to create a new <unk> for the bombing and to <unk> the investigation based on fake evidence that would remove the spotlight from the iranians nisman's report states
the public face of this plan was an agreement reached between both countries in two thousand and thirteen to jointly investigate the bombing by creating a <unk> truth commission nisman wrote
the plan never took off however because of an unexpected <unk> according to nisman's report
interpol refused to withdraw the red notices against the iranians
without that iran moved the deal to the back <unk> nisman wrote
the release of nisman's report was not a <unk>
its contents were widely reported but <unk> government and its supporters outright rejected the allegations
fernandez focused her attack on nisman's sources including two <unk> that the prosecutor identified as working for the country's intelligence services
these alleged spies ramon <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> never worked for argentine intelligence fernandez said
everything nisman argues is false fernandez says the spies were spies argentina didn't ask interpol to withdraw the red notices trade between argentina and iran has actually <unk> and so on
we think all the allegations are <unk> foreign minister <unk> timerman told cnn on thursday
<unk> government has done more than any previous administration to get to the bottom of the bombing timerman said
i am jewish he said
and to think that a person of my religion the jewish religion can make a deal not to <unk> the death of eighty five people most of them jewish in argentina
i have to tell you it's not easy to live with
the argentine government was not involved in nisman's death in any way he said
nobody i mean wanted more for mr. nisman to live and to answer questions than the president of argentina and myself timerman said
if the accusations and counter accusations laid out by all sides aren't confusing enough additional theories continue to arise
in a news conference argentina's chief of the cabinet ministers <unk> fernandez offered new questions
nisman was on vacation in europe with his teenage daughter when he suddenly cut short his trip and returned to argentina according to the cabinet chief
things just get stranger he said asking who called him back in a <unk>
why did he return
why did he leave his daughter there alone at an international airport
the cabinet chief said
it was previously reported in the local media that nisman told a reporter at least twice that this investigation might cost him his life
he also allegedly got the handgun from a friend because he feared for his security according to reports
the cabinet chief proposed another <unk>
the closer we read the more we are convinced that nisman didn't even write that complaint
what is the reason behind <unk> this
what is the objective
this is what we must find out
the whole story is a <unk> web that is hard to describe but reflects an observation argentine <unk> <unk> luis <unk> once made
reality is not always probable or likely
the <unk> who spoke on condition of anonymity told egypt's state owned <unk> online that the <unk> beard broke off by accident when the mask fell as it was being <unk> last year at the egyptian museum in cairo
he said the blue and gold <unk> beard was fixed back in place quickly with <unk> a type of strong <unk>
the <unk> was not a proper material to use to restore the mask although it is a conservation material with a very high strength for <unk> metal and stone he is quoted as saying
the <unk> said there was now a gap between the face and the beard where the <unk> had dried
however the egyptian <unk> general director mahmoud el <unk> dismissed the claims in an interview with <unk> online saying the beard was in its original position and that nothing had happened to the mask since he took up his position in october
an <unk> committee was assigned to <unk> the mask and beard in order to write a detailed report on the <unk> condition he said
minister of <unk> <unk> <unk> also told <unk> online that media reports of damage to the mask were <unk>
the boy king's elaborate burial mask discovered in his <unk> in one thousand nine hundred and twenty two is one of egypt's most outstanding <unk>
<unk> who ruled from one thousand three hundred and thirty six one thousand three hundred and twenty seven <unk> is thought to have been about seventeen years old when he died based on analysis of his mummy according to the british museum
his cause of death is not known
if confirmed it won't be the first time a historical treasure was damaged in an institution supposed to keep it safe

i am no longer prime minister since the constitutional court has already removed me thus there is essentially no position to <unk> me from
the legal grounds claimed by the <unk> were also <unk> as the target of <unk> me is to ban me from holding any political positions for five years which is a clear violation of my fundamental rights and <unk>
but the bangkok post reported friday that many <unk> members were <unk> and found she was unable to clear up the accusations against her

she said the rice <unk> <unk> was <unk> for the farmers and the country and that claims it lost money were wrong and motivated by political <unk> against her
i am not sad because i am the victim of this entire ordeal but i am sad for the rice farmers and all of the <unk> thai citizens whose lives will return to the vicious cycle of being poor debt ridden and being taken advantage of and most important of all being denied of their basic democratic rights under the rule of law she said

salman seventy nine is a <unk> of the royal family who is viewed as a <unk> and cautious reformer much like his predecessor says cnn's <unk> anderson in abu dhabi
he has served as defense minister and deputy prime minister of saudi arabia a vital u.s. ally in the middle east for years
like abdullah he's one of the dozens of sons of saudi arabia's founder king abdulaziz
here are some of the key points about the new ruler
salman was governor of the saudi capital riyadh for nearly five decades during a period of significant change
when he became governor in one thousand nine hundred and sixty three riyadh had two hundred thousand <unk> today it has more than seven million <unk> <unk> a senior fellow at the brookings <unk> center for middle east policy said in a commentary
salman <unk> over this remarkable <unk> with a record for good governance and a lack of corruption
he had to be a combination
of a reformer of a judge a jury in some cases and deal with dissent as well as dealing with economic issues robert jordan a former u.s. ambassador to saudi arabia told cnn
so i think he's well prepared for the task at hand
salman's experience running riyadh also involved keeping many of the numerous members of the saudi royal family in line
since most of the royal <unk> and <unk> live in riyadh he was also the family <unk> ensuring any <unk> were dealt with <unk> and quietly with no <unk> said <unk> who worked for the cia for thirty years
his national roles have since brought him wider responsibility
salman has been <unk> cabinet meetings for several months and handling almost all foreign travel responsibilities for the monarchy since he became the <unk> in two thousand and twelve <unk> said
salman's <unk> to the throne is in line with the <unk> put in place by abdullah before his death
i think that you'll see a <unk> very similar policies very similar <unk> <unk> said james <unk> president of the arab american institute
the kingdom is <unk>
it's changing it's <unk> and it will continue to do so over the next several decades
<unk> says the royal family values family <unk> and <unk> highly
the two previous saudi <unk> in the eighteen th and nineteen th centuries were <unk> by internal family <unk> which their foreign enemies <unk> he explains
with the arab world facing its worst crisis in decades the <unk> will want to present an image of stability and strength
salman is one of abdullah's younger brothers
but at seventy nine he's not particularly young
there are <unk> reports that he may have various health problems
but with saudi arabian media <unk> controlled by the state <unk> really sure what his condition is
<unk> says salman has had a stroke <unk> <unk> of the washington institute says the new king's brain is ravaged by <unk> and the economist reports he's believed to be suffering from <unk>
reports do <unk> sharply over just how ill prince salman really is and medical reports on the illnesses of the saudi royal family can be <unk> <unk> cautioned anthony <unk> cordesman a middle east expert at the center for strategic and international studies
salman's schedule of official meetings suggests a degree of health
but <unk> isn't convinced it proves he's highly capable
the fact that salman appears in public at all is attributed to his determination to become king or more likely the ambition of his closest relatives that he should do so he wrote last month
salman's first order after assuming the throne was to <unk> his youngest brother prince muqrin as the new crown prince
analysts see that <unk> as an effort to ensure future stability
abdullah had named muqrin as deputy crown prince in march
at sixty nine years old muqrin is relatively <unk>
a former head of intelligence for the kingdom he is also reportedly well liked by world leaders
muqrin has been closely linked to abdullah and his policies of modernization and reform according to cordesman
but the succession plan isn't without its critics
<unk> mother does not have royal blood which is a <unk> point for some people in saudi arabia
several of salman's sons also hold prominent positions
they include prince <unk> who in the one thousand nine hundred and eighty s became the first muslim <unk> and is now the president of saudi arabia's tourism authority
prince abdulaziz the deputy oil minister
and prince <unk> the governor of the medina region
another son prince khaled was reportedly among the pilots who carried out the first airstrikes on isis positions in syria last year
details about salman's earlier life and <unk> weren't immediately available friday
but an official <unk> contained one <unk> about his youth
he had apparently <unk> the quran by the age of ten it said
abdullah died early friday several weeks after the state run saudi press agency said he was suffering from <unk> and had been admitted to a hospital
the royal court didn't release an exact cause of death
he was ninety
to ensure a smooth transition the kingdom quickly appointed his seventy nine year old half brother salman bin abdulaziz to the throne
his half brother prince muqrin a decade younger is the new crown prince
after friday afternoon prayers at <unk> imam <unk> bin abdullah grand mosque the body of abdullah wrapped in a <unk> <unk> was carried from the mosque toward a cemetery followed by a <unk> procession of saudi men in traditional dress
he was later laid to rest after a simple swift ceremony
those present at the <unk> the <unk> closest to the late king were then to move on to a royal palace where they were to pay their respects to the new monarch
the ceremony of al <unk> or pledging of allegiance to the new king followed the funeral
condolences and <unk> poured in from all <unk> of the globe
to god we belong and indeed to him we shall return said the <unk> of the english language saudi newspaper arab news
<unk> jordan and the palestinian territories among others declared days of mourning
the u.n. secretary general praised abdullah for his arab peace initiative to end the arab israeli conflict
u.s. vice president joe biden said he would lead a delegation in the coming days to pay respects
king abdullah's life <unk> from before the birth of modern saudi arabia through its emergence as a critical force within the global economy and a leader among arab and islamic nations u.s. president barack obama said in a statement
speaking to cnn's richard quest in davos switzerland u.s. secretary of state john kerry said he expects no changes in his government's relations with saudi arabia
i don't <unk> anything based on the conversation we have had no he said
in an address to the nation his first televised appearance since becoming king salman offered his condolences to the saudi people
we will with god's will and power <unk> to the straight path this country followed since its establishment by king abdulaziz and his sons after him and will not <unk> at all from it since our constitution is the book of allah and the teachings of prophet mohammed he said
he also spoke of the desperate need for unity and solidarity among the followers of islam saying saudi arabia would continue to promote that
he had already issued six royal <unk> friday the saudi press agency reported including <unk> prince mohammed bin <unk> bin abdulaziz as the deputy crown prince
salman who has one point three three million followers on twitter but follows no one changed his twitter handle to <unk>
abdullah became king of the oil rich nation a key u.s. ally in the middle east in august two thousand and five
but he had been running saudi arabia since one thousand nine hundred and ninety six after half brother king <unk> stroke
in the context of the kingdom's conservative <unk> abdullah was seen as a reformer and often came up against more hardline <unk>
after <unk> to the throne abdullah took steps toward broader freedoms and invested some of the country's vast oil wealth in large scale education and infrastructure projects
he was really quite extraordinary figure
he was probably the most <unk> and liberal <unk> king of saudi arabia since king <unk> which is a long time ago in the early one thousand nine hundred and seventy s cnn's fareed zakaria said about abdullah whom he described as much loved
i had the opportunity to meet with him once and what you got a sense of was somebody who really was determined to move his country forward zakaria said
it's a conservative country and a conservative society and he kept <unk> that to me but he was very clear in the direction he wanted to go
however resistance from conservative factions hindered some of his efforts leaving many women in particular disappointed by a lack of progress toward greater independence
under abdullah's leadership the country slowly <unk> al qaeda capturing or killing its leaders in the kingdom forcing the <unk> underground and <unk> radical <unk>
it also took a more prominent role in international affairs
last year it became the lead arab nation in a u.s. led coalition to <unk> the <unk> isis group in iraq and syria
analysts are <unk> a smooth political transition despite the many challenges facing saudi arabia including iran the rise of isis the crisis in yemen and the drop in oil prices
saudi arabia has sixteen percents of the world's known oil reserves according to the u.s. energy information administration
the country is widely seen as the leader of <unk> and has a large influence on energy prices and political stability in the middle east
remember the last time the price of oil fell like this the soviet union collapsed said zakaria
that said the successor is a very <unk> man
he added
i don't expect any major shift but it marks a big change and we'll have to see what the new king is like
the case of raif badawi has <unk> international headlines and global outrage
badawi started a blog called free saudi <unk> in two thousand and eight to encourage discussion about islam particularly the <unk> of the nation's religious police in saudis personal lives
he was officially charged with <unk> liberal thought founding a liberal website and insulting islam
a jeddah court convicted him of insulting islam and handed down a ten year prison term and ordered that be <unk> one thousand times
badawi received his first fifty lashes in the second week in january and was taken back to prison
he was supposed to be beaten again the third week but saudi officials <unk> that due to medical advice the <unk> wife said
on wednesday a medical committee of about eight doctors <unk> badawi at king <unk> hospital in jeddah and determined he was too injured to <unk> the <unk> this week according to amnesty
instead of continuing to <unk> raif badawi by dragging out his ordeal with repeated <unk> the authorities should publicly <unk> an end to his flogging and release him immediately and <unk> said said <unk> deputy director of amnesty international's middle east and north africa program
raif badawi is still at risk
there is no way of knowing whether the saudi arabian authorities will disregard the medical advice and allow the flogging to go ahead <unk> said
<unk>
has saudi arabia bought the world's silence on human rights abuses
to the south yemen is in chaos
to the north the militant group isis is <unk> havoc in iraq and syria
more <unk> saudi arabia remains locked in a regional cold war with iran
within the kingdom's borders salman has to decide how to pace sensitive reforms while keeping a <unk> on extremism
the stakes are high in one of the leading regional powers in the middle east and a key u.s. ally
saudi arabia has been critical to preserving some degree of regional stability in the face of a growing iranian threat during the rise of islamic extremism that followed the u.s. <unk> of afghanistan and iraq and during the new wave of <unk> that began in the spring of two thousand and eleven anthony <unk> cordesman a middle east expert at the center for strategic and international studies wrote in a commentary this month
here are some of the main challenges salman now faces
the new king has been <unk> straight into the deep end with a fast developing crisis on saudi arabia's southern border
the pro saudi government in yemen has <unk> amid sectarian unrest
the country's president and prime minister resigned thursday night after a move by shiite houthi rebels to gain power in the capital in recent days
sunni majority saudi arabia which provides energy and financial support to yemen and shares a long border with it is looking on with growing anxiety <unk> of the prospect of another shiite dominated state in the region
this will <unk> the saudis just as the shia uprising in <unk> did said cnn intelligence and security analyst bob <unk>
saudi arabia all these years has avoided sending troops into yemen
it's a <unk> for the saudis said <unk>
they've got a <unk> border and they've put a lot of troops down there
but still they are <unk>
mohammed <unk> a spokesman for the yemeni embassy in washington told cnn on wednesday that without saudi support yemen will become a failed state
it's not far from that already
the poorest country in the region yemen is home to al qaeda in the arabian peninsula which u.s. officials consider to be the most dangerous branch of the terrorist network according to cnn terrorism analyst paul cruickshank
the yemen crisis <unk> into a broader issue for saudi arabia
the growing influence of iran in the region
yemeni officials have frequently accused iran of providing financial support and weapons to the houthis in an effort to control yemen's red sea coast on one of the world's busiest shipping <unk>
that makes saudi arabia very uncomfortable said cnn global affairs analyst <unk> <unk>
saudi arabia a sunni majority country <unk> shia run iran as a <unk> enemy
both are facing each other off in a bizarre game of <unk> they're playing across the arab world
tensions have <unk> between tehran and riyadh at least as far back as iran's islamic revolution in one thousand nine hundred and seventy nine
the conflict in syria has been viewed as a <unk> conflict between the two with iran supporting the regime of president bashar al assad and saudi arabia helping rebel groups
but the rise of the isis extremists amid the relentless bloodshed of the syrian war has complicated the <unk>
there are signs by the saudis and the iranians that it is in their interests to de escalate tensions to confront isis said <unk> al <unk> a fellow at <unk> <unk> institute for advanced study
but it's impossible to move from <unk> to alliance quickly
although the two sides realize that isis is a threat to some extent to both of them they don't think it is so big a threat as to move that fast to cooperation he said in november
the <unk> <unk> of large <unk> of territory in syria and iraq by isis has created a major <unk> in the region for the saudis
and the attempts of isis leader abu bakr al baghdadi to style himself as spiritual leader of muslims presents a challenge to the saudi monarchy which is responsible for islam's two <unk> cities <unk> and medina
the saudis fear it as a potential domestic threat turning salafism into a revolutionary political ideology rather than the pro regime <unk> it has usually been in saudi arabia says f. <unk> <unk> iii a senior foreign policy fellow at the brookings institution in doha qatar
saudi arabia is considered to be a key u.s. ally in the fight against isis
one of salman's sons prince khaled was reportedly among the pilots who carried out the first airstrikes on isis positions in syria last year
but salman also has some responsibility for saudi arabia's backing of jihadist fighters in previous conflicts according to david andrew <unk> a senior fellow at the foundation for defense of <unk>
salman played a significant role in the one thousand nine hundred and eighty s and one thousand nine hundred and ninety s gathering support in the royal family for <unk> holy warriors in places like afghanistan places like the <unk> <unk> told cnn
a number of these afghan and <unk> <unk> have in fact come back to saudi arabia and <unk> continued <unk>
the saudi government though has denied ever providing support to isis which is a <unk> group of al qaeda
salman's predecessor king abdullah is credited with managing to ride out the <unk> of the arab spring that swept away other arab <unk>
but with a fast growing population in an <unk> region the royal family has no room for <unk>
saudi arabia has faced and will face constant challenges in finding the pace of modernization and reform that <unk> forward as fast as possible while <unk> saudi popular support meeting saudi arabia's unique religious and cultural needs and ensuring that evolution will not turn into either <unk> or revolution said cordesman
as events in other parts of the region since two thousand and eleven have shown all too clearly it is easy to get things <unk> wrong and very hard to keep them going right he wrote
while some observers have applauded abdullah's cautious reforms others say he moved too slowly
if you look at where saudi arabia is today it hasn't actually moved that far from when he <unk> the throne in two thousand and five <unk> told cnn
the monarchy needs to allow greater freedoms for women improve the rights of the shiite minority <unk> the education system and give greater powers to elected bodies according to cordesman
with the recent sharp drop in oil prices officials will have to <unk> a <unk> course for the economy
saudi arabia depends heavily on oil revenues to fund its government
above all the saudi government needs to ensure that its rapidly growing population will have meaningful jobs and <unk> cordesman said
his two decades at the <unk> of one of the <unk> key strategic allies in the muslim world left an <unk> if <unk> legacy
here are the five most notable characteristics of his reign
hopes were high that abdullah's reputation as a <unk> reformer would translate into gains for women in the <unk> kingdom
but in the face of deep seated cultural opposition to change the progress was less than expected said cnn's senior international correspondent <unk> robertson
he promised a lot of reforms but
he was limited by the conservative nature of saudi society
abdullah was the first saudi monarch to <unk> women to government positions
in two thousand and thirteen he appointed thirty women to the one hundred and fifty member <unk> council the top <unk> body that plays an <unk> role within saudi arabia's absolute monarchy
this year women will be able to vote and run as candidates in <unk> elections for the first time and women have been elected to <unk> of chambers of commerce
but many other restrictions on saudi women remain
women can not <unk> leave the country go to school or open bank accounts without permission from a male guardian usually their father or husband
saudi arabia remains the only country where women are not allowed to drive despite <unk> and civil <unk> campaigns by activists in recent years
in november the <unk> council recommended that the ban be lifted with restrictions but the recommendation has not been acted on and those who <unk> the ban continue to be <unk>
robert w. jordan who served as u.s
ambassador to saudi arabia form two thousand and one to two thousand and three said he had frequent conversations with abdullah about human rights including the rights of women in the kingdom
he said don't push us to breaking point jordan told cnn
it's a <unk> kind of process of reform one that requires this kind of <unk>
ali al ahmed a former saudi political prisoner and the director of the institute for gulf affairs said abdullah's reputation as a reformer in some quarters was <unk>
the kingdom has been under international scrutiny in recent weeks for carrying out harsh punishments including executions and <unk>
reforms in saudi arabia do not exist
this is an absolute monarchy let's be honest he said
the september eleven two thousand and one attacks on saudi arabia's key ally in which fifteen of the nineteen attackers were saudi were an <unk> point for the kingdom
abdullah <unk> for the removal of u.s. troops who had been stationed in the country since one thousand nine hundred and ninety a prime <unk> for the september eleven attackers then set about <unk> its military with a one hundred and fifty billion dollar spend
attacks on residential <unk> housing many westerners in which dozens were killed led to a harsh crackdown on terrorist elements within the kingdom seeking to <unk> the house of <unk>
leaders were captured followers driven underground and radical <unk> <unk> said robertson
saudi arabia has taken a lead role in the u.s. led international coalition fighting the radical sunni terror group isis which now rivals al qaeda as the world's most <unk> jihadist group in syria and iraq
but questions remain about the links between saudi arabia and islamist terror
in an interview with cnn's christiane amanpour in october billionaire saudi <unk> prince <unk> bin <unk> acknowledged that unfortunately some extremists in saudi arabia
did fund certain extremist elements in syria but insisted that the support had been stopped
others argue that <unk> the <unk> form of sunni islam that is the kingdom's official religion <unk> throughout the muslim world provides the ideological <unk> ground for such groups
saudi arabia now faces a threat from isis on its on border
earlier this month isis allegedly attacked a saudi border patrol near <unk>
the kingdom is building a massive <unk> along its border with iraq in order to keep the militants out said robertson
one of abdullah's greatest <unk> has been his focus on <unk> the saudi education system said mark <unk> author of prophets and <unk>
saudi arabia from muhammad to the present
following a failed attempt in one thousand nine hundred and seventy nine by extremist insurgents to capture <unk> grand mosque and <unk> the saudi leadership the kingdom responded by becoming even more conservative said robertson
this renewed <unk> was reflected in the education system for two decades until abdullah began an ambitious program of modernization despite opposition from religious conservatives
the <unk> is the king abdullah <unk> program which has sent hundreds of thousands of young saudis abroad to study at the government's expense
the aim is to develop a <unk> of saudi nationals capable of <unk> <unk> workers in higher skilled jobs in the kingdom but also to bring a more modern international <unk> to the kingdom
giving these <unk> <unk> that the road of <unk> saudi arabia comes from education said robertson
at home the country's first <unk> <unk> king abdullah university of science and technology was founded amid some <unk> in two thousand and nine

the driver <unk> <unk> the <unk> pleas and continues to take the <unk> at a clip smoking all the while and <unk> breaking into <unk> <unk> of kurdish <unk> song
we're traveling from sanandaj the capital of iran's kurdistan province to <unk> a small city just a few kilometers from the border with iraq
it's the final day of <unk> the iranian new year and my companions a doctor called <unk> and a taxi driver named <unk> both from sanandaj are still on holiday
in a typical display of iranian hospitality they've offered to <unk> me on the journey
to the left of the narrow road is a <unk> sand <unk> mountain wall
to the right a fifty foot drop and a view across the spectacular <unk> valley a <unk> populated and beautiful part of the region
on the eastern edge of iran kurdistan province makes up part of a broader kurdish region which also <unk> <unk> sections of iraq syria and turkey
over the border in iraq the territory has been targeted by the islamic militant group known as isis but iranian kurdistan remains <unk> a peaceful world away from the violence
it also seems a world away from iran
although we're still within iran's borders the kurdistan region is quite different and more traditionally <unk> compared to the country's <unk>
<unk> and <unk> the residents here have more in common with their fellow kurds across the border than with iranians from tehran <unk> or <unk>
dress is traditional
men sport <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and heavy felt <unk> while the women wear colorful dresses and <unk> rather than the black <unk> or <unk> seen throughout much of the rest of iran
on the way we stop in a tiny village called <unk>
the mosque in the village is home to large <unk> quran said to be about one thousand three hundred years old
the <unk> <unk> carries an <unk> naming abu bakr the first caliph and according to sunni muslims the <unk> successor of the prophet mohammed
although most iranians are shia muslims the kurds are predominantly sunni and this has often put them at odds with the iranian government
a few days earlier a kurdish man in sanandaj had told me that police had <unk> removed a satellite <unk> from his roof to prevent him receiving kurdish television channels
another had pointed at a photo of a shia cleric in my <unk> and shaken his head saying not good not good
after <unk> the road winds through snow <unk> mountains and then drops down into the village of <unk> at <unk>
here the houses are built into the steep <unk> with the roof of one <unk> as a <unk> area for the building behind it
large blue or green <unk> windows face out over the valley
children <unk> each other around the streets
<unk> down the <unk> we stop near a stream to drink tea bought from a small shop
as in other parts of iran people don't <unk> their tea directly <unk> to place a sugar <unk> between their front teeth and then <unk> the tea through the sugar
the <unk> owner asks me where i come from
<unk> <unk> french <unk>
he <unk>
i tell him england <unk> and he <unk>
welcome
as we drink the tea an elderly man walks to the edge of the stream <unk> his shoes and <unk> <unk> up his <unk> and <unk> out to a large flat rock in the stream
he <unk> his hands feet and head and then begins his afternoon prayers in turn standing kneeling and then pressing his <unk> to the rock
once he's finished he carefully <unk> the way back and <unk> his feet with a <unk>
as we continue the journey the doctor takes over the driving and progress is slower but the <unk> <unk> are no longer quite so terrifying
we arrive at <unk> in the late afternoon
a large lake <unk> the afternoon sun and we stop at a restaurant at its edge
some friends of dr. <unk> join us for a <unk> of <unk> fish rice and <unk> vegetables
we sit cross <unk> on the floor and drink more black tea
afterward music is played and people <unk> arms and dance in a line men at one end and women at another jumping in <unk> and kicking their feet in time to the music
one of the women's <unk> <unk> back off her hair but no one pays much attention
the dancing goes on until the sun sets over the lake
we leave <unk> and head back toward sanandaj
the <unk> phone rings and he talks in rapid <unk> before suggesting we stop at a <unk> house on the way
my friend is very wealthy he tells me and he can trace his family back one thousand three hundred years
we stop on the outskirts of sanandaj
the <unk> house is certainly that of a rich man
<unk> gold picture <unk> <unk> black <unk> covered in intricate <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> carpets are laid out across the floor and a huge flat screen tv sits in the corner <unk> out kurdish pop music
before stepping further inside i remind myself that it's not polite to shake hands with women in iran
as i'm mentally <unk> myself on my cultural <unk> the sister of the owner of the house steps forward <unk> <unk> my hand and <unk> me to sit on the <unk>
huge <unk> of sweets and <unk> nuts are laid out
i sit next to the man's <unk> daughter who takes out her iphone and shows me photos on her instagram feed
most of the images are of western fashion models
i ask her why and she says
model is the best job
she plans to go to university in tehran and wants to study german but her long term ambition is to leave iran and she has many questions about life in the west
it's late and after more dancing this time in the <unk> <unk> living room to the music coming from the tv it's time to go
<unk> drives back toward the center of sanandaj
he <unk> in kurdish again but this time there's a more <unk> tone to the song
how to get there
british canadian and u.s. citizens <unk> to travel to iran must do so as part of an official tour due to restrictions on independent travel
most other foreign nationals need to obtain a visa before traveling and the application process can sometimes seem slightly <unk>
it's worth checking the most up to date visa requirements ahead of traveling as these can change with little notice
a variety of airlines fly to iran with <unk> imam <unk> international airport the main international hub
once in iran getting around is made <unk> by the country's comfortable extensive and relatively cheap bus or train networks while for longer <unk> internal flights are an option
for shorter journeys and day trips <unk> are relatively affordable due to low fuel costs

the <unk> of yemeni president abdu rabu mansour hadi and other officials are the latest <unk> from the houthis move in recent days to gain power in the capital which included kidnapping hadi's chief of staff on saturday and taking over the presidential palace on tuesday
the chaos in yemen is cause for concern far beyond the country's borders
for the united states and its allies yemen's government has been a key ally in the fight against al qaeda in the arabian peninsula the yemen based group linked to attacks such as the recent slaughter at french magazine charlie hebdo
the united states responded by reducing embassy personnel in the capital because of security concerns a senior state department official said thursday night
while the embassy remains open and is continuing to operate we may continue to re <unk> resources based on the situation on the ground the official said
the cabinet and prime minister khaled bahah resigned before hadi did on thursday night with bahah telling hadi in a letter that they essentially wanted to wash their hands of destructive political chaos an apparent reference to the deal that was to give houthis more power
we resigned so that we are not made party to what is going on and what will happen bahah wrote in the letter which yemeni information minister <unk> sakkaf posted on twitter
hadi's resignation came soon afterward
it wasn't immediately clear who would succeed hadi
the houthis latest push to power picked up <unk> on saturday
the houthi rebels shiite muslims who have long felt marginalized in the majority sunni country kidnapped presidential chief of staff ahmed bin mubarak in the capital sanaa on saturday
the rebels then took over the presidential palace tuesday prompting talk of a coup
the tentative deal reached wednesday called for bin mubarak's release as well as measures to give the houthis more political power according to a yemeni official with access to a draft text of the agreement
but by thursday before the top officials quit sakkaf questioned whether the rebels would live up to their side of the <unk>
ahmed mubarak is still houthis hostage despite deal
they got what they want why should they <unk> their promise
she said on twitter
she added i have been following up the promises to release dr. ahmed bin mubarak since the beginning
conclusion
buying time
<unk> was <unk> the implementation of the peace deal both sides said thursday
one yemeni presidential adviser told cnn the government was waiting for the houthis to release bin mubarak but acknowledged that the rebels have <unk> some forces
ahmed al <unk> a houthi official said they were <unk> of how serious hadi was about the deal and that they were keeping twenty percents of their militia numbers in the presidential palace and other key buildings as a guarantee
questions about who was in charge over the past few days have sparked concerns that a power vacuum could help terrorist groups get a stronger <unk>
besides the charlie hebdo attack aqap also tried to blow up a plane landing in detroit in two thousand and nine
isis is also recruiting in yemen to expand its ranks
under the peace deal the houthi rebels agreed to withdraw their militias from key government institutions if officials take a significant step
<unk> parts of the country's constitution according to the yemeni official
under its terms the government would accept changes in the draft of the new constitution that would grant the houthis more political power
word of the deal still leaves many questions unanswered
what could the <unk> constitution look like
how much power will the rebels get
u.s. officials said they're unclear about the <unk> of the houthis
do they want to run the government
or be a powerful opposition
there are currently no talks with the houthis but there are discussions about whether to talk to them according to u.s. officials
multiple policy options are being considered the officials said though there is no consensus yet about how to <unk>
several of the constitutional changes sought by the houthis would <unk> the characteristics of yemen as a federal state and push for more <unk> of diverse groups
seven things to know about yemen
the houthis call for marginalized political groups to have the right to <unk> in state institutions and fair representation according to the text of the tentative agreement
in return for these government <unk> the rebels basically agree to withdraw their fighters from the capital where they control or <unk> several government installations
the presidential palace the presidential residence the prime minister's residence and a military <unk> where missiles are housed
a houthi official said the rebels would abide by the deal if the president follows a <unk> <unk> in the negotiations for the political process
this isn't the first time the rebels and the government have <unk> out an agreement
houthis swept into the capital last year <unk> battles that left more than three hundred people dead in a month
in september they signed a ceasefire deal with the government and houthis have since installed themselves in key positions in the government and financial institutions
as violence <unk> seven things to know about yemen
the number of fighters killed has not been publicly discussed before but was disclosed by the u.s. ambassador to iraq <unk> jones who told al <unk> television earlier in the day that an estimated six thousand fighters have been killed
jones said the military effort was having a devastating impact on isis
the estimate was <unk> by u.s. central command and finds isis fighters have been killed in iraq and syria by coalition airstrikes according to a u.s. military official
<unk> has kept a running estimate of fighters killed but has not made it public
u.s. intelligence estimates that isis has a total force of somewhere between nine thousand to eighteen thousand fighters
however it is also believed the group can draw on thousands of other fighters whose <unk> shifts and could muster a force <unk> of thirty one thousand total
defense secretary <unk> hagel would not confirm the six thousand deaths estimate instead saying thousands have been killed
on whether the body count is a sign of progress hagel said it's a measure but i don't think it's the measure
i was in a war where we did body counts and we lost that one hagel said referring to his service in vietnam
until now the pentagon has stayed away <unk> the matter other than to estimate that thousands of fighters may have been killed
speaking to reporters thursday rear <unk> john kirby was <unk> that the us is not keeping a body count and said it would be wrong to state that there is such a count
he called it a <unk> and said the notion of a body count suggests vietnam war era statistics
in that war the pentagon offered body counts as a measure of its success against the <unk> <unk>
kirby said the <unk> was not aimed at showing any <unk> of success against isis
all of this comes after iraq has criticized the u.s. for not doing enough to help their fight against isis
the u.s. has long said airstrikes are aimed at <unk> isis as a threat but would not by themselves get rid of the organization
secretary of state kerry speaking to reporters in london echoed the u.s. ambassador in saying the strikes have <unk> isis momentum and <unk> more than seven hundred square kilometers from isis in iraq
in iraq airstrikes around mosul have been stepped up significantly in support of peshmerga fighters on the advance in the region
the effort now is to cut a key isis supply line into mosul a us military official said
the official stressed the us can not confirm the exact number but has based its <unk> based on pilot reports and other intelligence gathered about a target before and after a strike
oh get over it
get over it and move on says the fifth most powerful women in the world according to forbes
i've failed myself
twice i tried to enter the national school of administration in the french system and i failed
<unk> might have failed twice but the fifty nine year old is a woman of <unk>
she is the first woman to chair the global law firm <unk> and <unk>
the first female finance minister of france
and since two thousand and eleven the first woman to lead the <unk>
the mother of <unk> philosophy is to learn from her <unk> adding
and then you move on
moving on is something <unk> is trying to do now
last year <unk> placed <unk> under formal investigation in <unk> to a political <unk> case dating back to her days as a french finance minister
<unk> is appealing the decision
but how does she cope with the weight of these allegations
with strength with my sense of duty to my country with the <unk> that i made the right choice at the time independently she said
we asked other women at the top of their fields about the biggest <unk> of their careers
like <unk> many said set backs can later become sources of great strength
my mother would tell me from a very young age never to be afraid of failing <unk> told cnn's leading women
i was absolutely fine taking risks
trying to get into cambridge when everybody said you'll never get in or writing my first book when i was twenty three
a lot of things were likely to fail and many did fail
i mean my first book did well my second book was rejected by thirty six <unk>
the sixty four year old has now written fourteen books
<unk> advice has been to embrace failure
you can recognize very often that out of these projects that may not have succeeded themselves that other <unk> are built she said
one of the iranian born <unk> greatest professional <unk> was her rejected design for the <unk> bay opera house in wales in one thousand nine hundred and ninety five
<unk> won the commission twice but her building never saw the light of day after it was thwarted by local politicians
i know a lot of people thought i would give up because it was such an awful painful experience
i remember the day it happened i thought i will not let this finish me she said
in a way it saved me
i think it did make me stronger
she's the self made chinese billionaire who's <unk> than <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
but it wasn't an easy rise to the top for forty nine year old property <unk> <unk> who as a teenager worked in a factory before raising enough money to study in britain
did she come across a lot of <unk>
every day
i mean i think that's just life says the mother of two with an estimated worth of two billion dollar
you will always <unk> into <unk> challenges and problems
it appears to be that we seem to be doing quite well but as it is now we're still having challenges every day
so i think that's just nothing unique
that's just life
described as the <unk> of africa nigerian talk show host <unk> <unk> has interviewed such high profile guests as <unk> chief <unk> <unk> and former u.s. secretary of state hillary clinton
however one <unk> <unk> still dreams of having on her program moments with <unk> is american talk show queen <unk> <unk>
so far <unk> has been unable to make contact with <unk>
but rather than knock the wind out of her <unk> it's made her all the more determined to change the face of african television
of course there were many knock backs along the way many people telling me you can't do these things said <unk>
but i think what's important in life is that you believe in yourself and the things you can do
the announcement of the papyrus discovery and <unk> publication was made by <unk> evans professor of new testament at <unk> <unk> college in <unk> <unk> <unk>
evans described the papyrus as a <unk> of the gospel of mark
he added that a combination of <unk> analysis and carbon dating led him and his team of researchers to <unk> that the <unk> was written before ninety <unk>
this would make it at least a decade older than other early fragments of the new testament and thus an <unk> resource for <unk> scholars and object of <unk> interest for christians the world over
the <unk> according to evans was discovered when an egyptian mummy mask known as <unk> was <unk> in a hunt for ancient documents
mummy masks were an important part of ancient egyptian burial practice but only the very wealthy could afford examples made of gold
the majority of mummy masks were made from <unk> of <unk> and papyrus which were <unk> together into a kind of ancient <unk> <unk>
<unk> these masks <unk> a <unk> of ancient documents
evans claims that in addition to christian texts hundreds of <unk> greek texts records of business <unk> and personal letters have been <unk>
in the process the mask itself is destroyed
though it may be making headlines now the claim that the oldest known gospel has been discovered is not new
news of the <unk> first came to light in two thousand and twelve when its existence was announced by daniel <unk> founder of the center for the study of new testament <unk> at dallas <unk> <unk>
no one saw the text then and no one has seen it now
though it has been mentioned repeatedly by a select group of people who <unk> have been given access to it its planned date of publication has been consistently pushed back from an original plan of two thousand and thirteen to two thousand and fifteen and now just this week all the way to two thousand and seventeen
despite the seemingly explosive quality of the news therefore it is important to take a step back and consider what is actually being revealed here
some people are saying they have this really old and important thing and they will show it to all the rest of us in a few years
it is unclear why anyone would start talking about a text like this a year indeed now at least two years in advance
the most important established fact about this papyrus at this point is that it has not yet been <unk> is to say only a small handful of individuals have seen the text and are able to say anything at all about it
as <unk> <unk> an ancient historian and <unk> from the university of manchester in england told us the academic community has not been given access to firm information and images on the basis of which could eventually say something
in other words this sort of notice really serves mostly to remind us of just how little we know about this purported discovery
here for example are five key unanswered questions
what is the actual text on the papyrus
we are told that it is from mark but after all no one has seen it
which part of mark
is the <unk> consistent with the supposed dating
<unk> jones a <unk> at <unk> university told us that dating a text by <unk> or <unk> is not a precise science and i know of no <unk> who would date a <unk> <unk> to within a decade on the basis of <unk> alone
is the <unk> or papyrus itself consistent with the supposed dating
according to jones if <unk> is <unk> <unk> dating is equally <unk> since one must allow for a time gap of a century or more
they say that these lab tests have all been done but as no one has actually seen the reports they are less than <unk>
who owns the papyrus or the mask from which it was taken and from whom was it <unk> and when
the time and place of a <unk> discovery known as its <unk> are crucial for <unk> its authenticity especially in a period of extensive <unk> of <unk> sites and museum <unk>
according to international law if the mask was taken out of egypt after one thousand nine hundred and seventy it is officially <unk> and is effectively prohibited from being sold or published
evans told us i do not know the specifics about the <unk> of this mask
who has seen the text who has verified it and who has studied it
evans is not a trained <unk> but is rather a scholar of the new testament
to this point none of the <unk> text critics or other highly <unk> experts who must have worked on this text before these claims could be made about it have been identified or spoken publicly about it
these questions are not necessarily challenges to the authenticity of the text
they are rather a recognition that until the <unk> world has been granted access to this papyrus the public statements made about it are no more <unk> than if we announced that we had found <unk> private copy of <unk> in a <unk> container and we'll show it to you later
there is however one bit of information about this text and its discovery that can be discussed now without having even seen it
the fact that it was <unk> by <unk> an ancient egyptian mummy mask
evans said the <unk> destruction was acceptable because we're not talking about the destruction of any museum quality piece
we are however talking about the destruction of two thousand year old egyptian <unk>
funeral masks painted with <unk> of people who lived and died and were <unk> by their families
we might wonder at the very least who it is that gets to determine which masks are worth preserving and which aren't
evans told us that such decisions are based on expert opinion but as to who exactly makes that determination he said i do not know specifically
evans has said we dug underneath <unk> face and there it was
he has since <unk> that he was not personally involved in the destruction of the mask
but it is unclear <unk> which individuals did the dirty work
evans language of <unk> makes the <unk> of mummy masks sound like <unk> but some would <unk> it and some have as cultural <unk>
there is an <unk> sense that the discovery of a rare christian piece <unk> the <unk> of a relatively common egyptian <unk>
and this may be so but surely the <unk> would be better if this were announced by someone from say the egyptian ministry of state for <unk>
the destruction of mummy masks though legal falls into an <unk> gray area right now because of the difficult choices scientists have to make in the lab when working with them said douglas <unk> a professor of history at st. louis university
we have to ask ourselves do we value the cultural heritage of egypt as something worth preserving in itself or do we see it simply as vehicle for <unk> christian texts
even if one agrees that these masks can be taken apart <unk> is by its very nature a destructive process it should be remembered that the process is a <unk>
if a mask contains no texts then the <unk> changes and even a relatively <unk> cultural piece has been destroyed for nothing
<unk> also reminded us that you do not need to completely destroy masks for getting out texts if you use methods developed and improved by <unk> since one thousand nine hundred and eighty
if a mask is to be destroyed surely that process should be documented <unk> with constant photography and <unk> rather than <unk> as a classroom project with <unk> using a bottle of <unk> and a little <unk> <unk>
it is possible that the <unk> text of the gospel of mark has been discovered
but until the world is given access to the papyrus through its publication there is no story here except that ancient egyptian mummy masks are being destroyed in the ongoing search for christian <unk>
successful methods such as <unk> work by killing the cancer cells but they also destroy healthy tissue
health <unk> have been searching for a magic bullet that goes straight to the source of the cancer and everything from <unk> <unk> which carry cancer drugs direct to cancer cells to straight surgery to cut out <unk> have been used with varying degrees of success
in belgium engineer and nuclear physicist <unk> <unk> is <unk> a new therapy that targets <unk> with proton radiation
a therapy that offers precision and <unk> side effects
i started to designing equipment proton therapy of cancer that was a <unk> new idea <unk> told cnn
<unk> in a two <unk> thick concrete bunker that serves as a radiation <unk> one of <unk> <unk> machines <unk> proton <unk> to treat cancer patients
in this space we <unk> the <unk> and we give them a higher and higher <unk> until they reach two thirds of the speed of light that's two hundred thousand km per second and this <unk> takes place in the shape of a spiral he said
that's needed if you want to be able to <unk> one foot into the body of a patient
once the proton <unk> has been generated it's <unk> into a treatment room where patients receive a powerful <unk> of targeted radiation that kills only those <unk> cells
it does a lot less <unk> damage to the patient <unk> said
that's the great thing about proton therapy
while proton therapy is a giant step forward it's not yet the magic bullet that <unk> are looking for
so far it is not effective against all types of cancer
there are a number of <unk> which are not <unk> he said
if you look at <unk> which is cancer of the blood cells there is nowhere to shoot it's all through the body
the other <unk> is that the <unk> is not cheap
each system and the bunker needed to house it doesn't leave much change from one hundred and twenty five million dollar
currently there are just forty three operational <unk> therapy facilities worldwide with a total of one hundred and twenty one treatment rooms
as the fame of the process has started to spread some people have been taking desperate measures to get treatment
one british couple last year even sparked an international manhunt after they removed their son from hospital without doctors permission to get to a proton center in prague in the <unk> republic
proton treatment is limited on britain's national health service
just one center in the north of the country offers proton therapy for certain types of eye <unk>
other centers however are currently in development
while the proton therapy market is expected to more than double by two thousand and eighteen with an estimated three hundred proton therapy rooms <unk> brussels based company <unk> is working on a smaller and cheaper model they hope will make proton therapy more accessible
it would be much less expensive making it more possible for a hospital to afford it a smaller system can already treat a relatively large number of patients per year
at the moment fewer than one percents of cancer patients are treated with proton therapy but <unk> is hopeful that smaller and cheaper machines will be the game <unk>
i have a number of letters from parents of young kids saying if it had not been for this treatment we would have lost our kid he said
that's something i really <unk>
when i feel a bit <unk> for whatever reason i go back to those letters and they are very exciting
digital nose on a <unk> can <unk> out cancer

this week's two hundred million dollar demand in return for the lives of two japanese citizens perhaps represents a change of tactics from isis the group that now rules over large parts of syria and iraq as they realize that with the notable <unk> of the u.s. and the uk the willingness of western nations to resist making some form of payment in the face of youtube videos of their citizens <unk> for their lives is weak
is an <unk> resistance towards ransom payments a <unk> position to take
is offering no hope of some form of <unk> settlement in the best interest of a nation's citizens
or would it in fact make more sense to take a flexible approach that operates on a case by case basis <unk> in negotiation and considers all possible options including ransom
the arguments against payment are well <unk> and <unk> repeated by those that attempt to hold the international line
since nine eleven the attempt to <unk> terrorist organizations of <unk> has been a <unk> of the global effort to counter these groups
payment of ransoms to terrorist organizations for the safe return of citizens is thus entirely contrary to the <unk> of national and international laws and norms that have emerged
at a two thousand and thirteen summit in northern ireland world leaders noted that the international community has made significant progress in combating the flow of funds to terrorist organizations but also drew attention to the substantial financial benefit being earned through ransom payments and the <unk> this provided for further kidnappings
following the g eight summit and <unk> the fact that in two thousand and nine the u.n. reminded member states of their obligation to prevent the payment of ransoms to terrorists under security council resolution one thousand nine hundred and four the security council passed a further resolution in january two thousand and fourteen calling upon member states to prevent terrorists from benefiting directly or <unk> from ransom payments
without doubt paying ransoms <unk> more kidnappings it is a self <unk> self <unk> cycle
the u.s. administration argues that hostage takers looking for ransoms <unk> between those governments that pay ransoms and those that do not
and make a point of not taking hostages from those countries that refuse to make <unk>
be that as it may the murder in two thousand and nine of british citizen <unk> <unk> by al qaeda in the islamic maghreb whilst his fellow swiss and german captives were freed following the reported payment of a substantial ransom shows that refusing to pay is <unk>
<unk> the procession of gruesome beheadings visited on american and british hostages by isis in two thousand and fourteen suggests that in the knowledge that the u.s. and uk will not pay ransoms captured citizens from these two countries are far more likely to be murdered in the pursuit of propaganda
while paying ransoms increases the risk of further kidnappings it also clearly increases the <unk> of a safe and successful outcome
offering to consider ransom demands <unk> a critical <unk> for success <unk> a willingness to negotiate
the secretive world of kidnap for ransom <unk> provides a source of <unk> insight
this industry <unk> following the kidnap ransom and death of the twenty month old baby son of u.s. <unk> charles <unk>
at the heart of the growth and success of this <unk> industry is its ability to respond to and engage with kidnappers normally via <unk>
success is <unk> not only by the safe return of a captured individual but also by the ability to negotiate a price that is far removed from the opening ask
knowing that ransom payments to designated terrorist groups are illegal <unk> specialists will quickly pass <unk> situations involving terrorist groups to government authorities and the <unk> are rarely as favorable as those that can be achieved via expert negotiation
<unk> the facts presented to <unk> change and <unk> must adapt
such a moment for <unk> has arrived
kidnap for ransom is an increasingly widely used tool by terrorist groups
<unk> al wuhayshi leader of yemen based al qaeda in the arabian peninsula which is estimated to have earned twenty million dollar from ransom between two thousand and eleven and two thousand and thirteen <unk> that kidnapping hostages is an easy <unk> and a <unk> trade and a precious treasure
in several recorded messages al qaeda leader <unk> al <unk> has called for supporters worldwide to kidnap westerners
stomach <unk> as it may be to finance designated terrorists in recent months citizens of france germany denmark and italy have returned safely home
citizens of the uk and the u.s. have not
the point blank <unk> to pay ransoms is wrong headed
a more <unk> approach that leaves all options including payment open for negotiation is much more likely to result in success
<unk> <unk> the leader of the far right anti muslim nine hundred and sixty nine movement made the remarks about <unk> lee the <unk> special <unk> on myanmar at a public rally on friday
don't <unk> you are a <unk> person just because of your position he said in the speech footage of which was widely circulated on social media
to us you are just a <unk>
the comments drew a sharp response from the u.n. high commissioner for human rights <unk> <unk> al hussein who described <unk> remarks as <unk> insulting and <unk> unacceptable
i call on religious and political leaders in myanmar to unequivocally condemn all forms of <unk> to hatred including this abhorrent public personal attack he said in a statement released from geneva wednesday
it's <unk> for u.n. special <unk> to be treated in this way
lee was on a ten day visit reporting on the human rights situation in the predominantly buddhist southeast asian country which is emerging from a half century of military rule
she had spoken out about the crisis facing the country's one point three million strong <unk> muslim minority most of whom live under apartheid like conditions in <unk> state with limited access to <unk> <unk> and education
since an outbreak of <unk> violence between <unk> and muslims in two thousand and twelve more than one hundred and thirty thousand live in <unk> <unk> camps they are forbidden to leave
lee also criticized proposed law changes backed by the <unk> including a bill <unk> <unk> marriage and religious <unk>
she made reference to <unk> comments in a statement this week

ukraine's state run ukrinform news citing the donetsk government reported eight dead and seven hospitalized in the bus stop attack alone
donetsk has been a stronghold for separatists who have been battling government forces for control of the donetsk and luhansk regions since the spring
as of now the situation remains difficult the city council said
and as has been the case with many incidents in the conflict there was no <unk> accepted explanation of what happened or who was responsible
russia's foreign ministry demanded an investigation and criticized ukraine for its shelling of ukrainian cities like donetsk which are controlled or at least full of pro russian separatists
yet ukraine's defense ministry blamed the rebels for the attack saying it was launched from areas they control
the organization for security and cooperation in europe which has a monitoring mission in ukraine is among those trying to get to the bottom of it all
its deputy chief monitor alexander hug told reporters that an <unk> patrol saw seven bodies near a vehicle that had been hit

as u.s. gen. philip <unk> <unk> supreme allied commander europe pointed out thursday
violence has intensified and changed character in ukraine
as has been true so often in recent months the violence is happening around the same time as negotiations aimed at stopping it
the latest talks happened wednesday in berlin and included the foreign ministers of ukraine and russia as well as germany and france
their official aim was to resolve the crisis by <unk> out how to implement a peace deal that was agreed upon last year
after wednesday's talks the four foreign ministers condemned the continuing violence and called for the peace deal that was reached in minsk belarus last september to be respected
fighting in the donetsk and luhansk regions has severely <unk> causing the loss of many human lives including civilians
this must stop immediately and the regime of quiet must be restored the ministers said
they said tangible progress must be made on full implementation of the minsk <unk> ahead of a planned peace summit
the attack on the donetsk <unk> bus station obviously doesn't help the situation
russia's foreign ministry called it a a crime against humanity a great provocation aimed to undermine the efforts for the peaceful settlement of the crisis
the unrest began in late two thousand and thirteen leading up to <unk> <unk> last february of pro moscow president <unk> <unk>
russia annexed the <unk> peninsula a few weeks later with fighting breaking out in april in two ukrainian regions <unk> russia donetsk and luhansk
separatist leaders there declared independence from ukraine and <unk> with russia
but how much was and is moscow involved in their campaign
it depends who you ask
officials in moscow have expressed sympathy for the separatists but denied any outright military support
however ukraine and its allies have accused russia of <unk> the rebellion by actively backing it
it is clear that russia has to stop supporting the separatists and respect international law said <unk> gen. <unk> <unk> chairman of the military committee for nato which doesn't include ukraine but is working to further its military to military cooperation with kiev

that teenager called kim disappeared in a southern turkish border city earlier this month leading authorities to suspect that he may have <unk> away to syria to join isis

i hate <unk> he said according to a post on his twitter account on october five
so i like the isis
he <unk> arabic posts and tweeted in english but never in korean
his last tweet was sent on october ten which was the same month he began asking his mother if he could go to turkey according to seoul <unk> police agency
kim's mother told police that she had not been aware of his interest in isis
cnn was unable to reach kim's parents
south korea may not be a probable place for aspiring isis members with less than zero point three percents of the population identifying as muslim
but isis has expanded its reach globally
the islamic militant group has attracted <unk> youth from around the world including the united states france europe and australia
there have also been reports about recruits joining isis from asia <unk> concerns in the region
why is isis so successful at <unk> westerners
earlier last year there was a report of a chinese fighter caught in iraq in september
it's unclear how many chinese nationals may be fighting with isis but one former chinese special envoy to the middle east said there could be about one hundred
it remains unclear if some of them are <unk> a muslim minority group in xinjiang
approximately three hundred and fifty southeast <unk> were estimated to be in iraq and syria said a singapore official during a security council meeting in november

they feel somewhat they're having a crisis of identity
the <unk> is that the religiously <unk> are the ones joining isis but that's not proven out by the data we have so far
kim began <unk> with an individual whom he met on twitter over an <unk> messaging service police said
on january eight he arrived in turkey with a korean guardian
two days later he disappeared from a hotel in <unk> a city near the syrian border

chairi a twenty seven year old belgian comedian who <unk> with a <unk> <unk> group that calls itself the muslim <unk> was speaking several days after a deadly gun battle erupted last week between suspected jihadists and police in the eastern belgian town of verviers
news of the suspected belgian terror cell immediately sent <unk> of fear through this small european country's muslim community
i was <unk> out
really scared said chairi who fears young belgian born muslims could become victims of a backlash after the raid
my <unk> said no one can go out tonight because of what happened said <unk> <unk>
the nineteen year old <unk> said her <unk> mother made her <unk> work the night of the anti terror raid
both chairi and <unk> were speaking in the <unk> of a muslim youth center <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> opened little more than a year ago with the goal of promoting a peaceful and productive <unk> of european and islamic values
but the <unk> director said the recent reports of a suspected <unk> belgian terror cell emerging so soon after french jihadis massacred cartoonists in the paris office of the satirical magazine charlie hebdo had threatened this vision of <unk> and integration
we condemn what's happened
this is not our vision our understanding of our religion said director <unk> el <unk>
in french <unk> english he explained how belgium's muslim community was finding itself increasingly trapped between two ideological <unk>
we face islamist radicalization
but we also face the increase of <unk> in belgium el <unk> said
we know that <unk> <unk> discrimination help this radicalization of young muslim people here in belgium
the january fifteen raid in verviers resulted in the shooting deaths of two belgian citizens
police said they were found in possession of assault rifles <unk> explosives and police uniforms
the suspects have been accused of being part of a plot to target belgian police inspired by the ultra violent ideology of isis
the gun battle triggered an international manhunt
since january fifteen belgian authorities have arrested and charged at least seven <unk> with participation in a terrorist organization
the federal prosecutor's office announced three of the suspects were intercepted at the airport in brussels while trying to fly to greece with plans to then travel on to syria
a senior belgian counter terrorist official tells cnn the suspected leader of the verviers cell is a young belgian of moroccan descent named <unk> abaaoud
abaaoud who is still at large appeared in an isis propaganda video <unk> and <unk> to the camera while driving a pick up truck that was dragging at least half a dozen <unk> through a field
he also brought his teenage brother to syria who has since appeared in photos posing alongside isis fighters
he is not the only molenbeek native to embrace the isis jihad
there are several people who left here to fight in syria
and some who came back
that's the danger said molenbeek mayor <unk> <unk>
she spoke to cnn in the <unk> central square which is <unk> with <unk> <unk> shops and grocery stores advertising their goods in french and arabic
a <unk> procession of residents many of them women wearing islamic <unk> <unk>
in the side streets one could over hear conversations in french arabic and turkish
molenbeek has a large predominantly muslim population of first second and third generation immigrants from north africa
the mayor said the neighborhood also suffered from <unk> youth unemployment estimated at more than forty percents
as part of their effort to stop the suspected isis linked cell in verviers belgian police have carried out multiple raids in molenbeek over the course of the last week
the defense attorney for a molenbeek native arrested by police last week said his client was innocent of terrorism charges
didier de <unk> argued that his client an unemployed former twenty five year old security guard named <unk> el bali did not fit the terrorist profile because he had no previous criminal record
he lives in molenbeek which is one of the neighborhoods most <unk> by terrorism and thus it's a miracle not to have problems with the authorities when you live there de <unk> said
while unemployment is <unk> online propaganda for isis bloody interpretation of jihad is often only a <unk> click away
chairi the comedian who also hosts a radio show that <unk> upon belgian muslim affairs <unk> that his radicalized <unk> don't learn their islam in mosques or in institutions
they learn it on the internet
he recalled meeting a young muslim convert
just a few months after embracing islam in belgium chairi said he read in a newspaper that the young man was killed fighting on the <unk> of syria
it goes so fast
even the religious leaders they don't understand it chairi said
people <unk> themselves said el <unk> director of point <unk>
el <unk> says he has taken to social media to denounce online propaganda urging volunteers to join isis
but he <unk> the jihadi message can be <unk> to vulnerable youths
the speech to get you to go to syria is very simple
you have your enemy you want to have the power to build your future and you don't need to find a solution to the complexity of your life that we have here in belgium el <unk> said
it is this toxic mix of unemployment <unk> and the <unk> call of jihad that have helped make brussels the capital of europe a recruiting ground for terrorism
to all members of isis kenji goto is not the enemy of isis
please release him junko ishido goto's mother said in a statement thursday
there is so little time left before the deadline
isis has threatened in a video released tuesday to kill two japanese citizens goto and haruna yukawa if it doesn't receive two hundred million dollar in ransom from the japanese government
time is of the essence
the japanese government says it estimates isis ultimatum will <unk> at two fifty p.m. friday tokyo time
i <unk> apologize to the japanese government and all concerned foreign countries for all the trouble that my son has caused ishido said
i have been just crying for last three days filled with sadness
words fail to describe how i feel
kenji always has been a kind person ever since he was little
he was always saying i want to save the lives of children in war zones
japanese officials have said they are doing their best to communicate with isis but japanese chief cabinet secretary <unk> suga said thursday that tokyo had so far heard nothing and doesn't know what situation the two hostages are in
in a thursday news conference japanese chief cabinet secretary <unk> suga said japan wants to secure the hostages safe release but will not yield to the threat of the terrorists
he said japan was trying to reach the isis captors through third parties such as governments in the region or local tribal leaders but has not been able to determine whether goto and yukawa are safe
we are <unk> to save them as soon as possible suga said thursday
the government of jordan has told japan it will do as much as possible to try to secure the release of goto and yukawa according to suga
jordan one of the arab nations taking part in the u.s. led bombing campaign against isis already has its own challenge to deal with
the militant group last month captured a jordanian pilot whose plane crashed in syria
japanese officials have repeatedly stressed that their military which is <unk> forbidden from taking action other than for self defense isn't involved in the international airstrikes against isis positions in syria and iraq
the masked militant speaking in the isis video linked the group's ransom demand to japanese prime minister shinzo <unk> recent pledge of two hundred million dollar in financial aid to countries affected by the militant group
suga reiterated thursday that the funds japan has offered are for humanitarian purposes like helping refugees not military purposes
leading japanese news organizations have reported citing unidentified government sources that goto's wife got an e mail in december from someone demanding eight million dollar to sixteen million dollar for her husband's return
the government is trying to confirm if that e mail came from isis the reports said
if so it could indicate the militant group is willing to accept a smaller ransom than the two hundred million dollar it had publicly demanded
but the question is what if anything is japan willing to give
isis has a ruthless track record
it has released videos <unk> the killing of five western hostages since august
abe has called isis ultimatum over the two japanese men's lives unacceptable and said the international community shouldn't give in to terrorists
but he and other government officials haven't explicitly ruled out paying a ransom
some details have emerged about what spurred the two japanese citizens to travel thousands of miles to the bloody syrian conflict
while they had different <unk> the two men knew and talked to each other said yukawa's friend <unk> kimoto
goto an experienced freelance journalist made a video in october near the turkish syrian border before he <unk> on a <unk> journey into isis controlled territory
it is my responsibility if something happens he explained
goto forty seven said he was determined to cover what was happening in the region
syrian people suffering three years and a half
it's enough he said
so i would like to get the story of what isis wants to do
<unk> al zaim who had worked with goto in syria previously says he warned him not to enter the isis stronghold of raqqa
i tell him it's not safe for you al zaim told cnn
but goto chose to go anyway saying i am not american i am not british
i'm japanese
i can go al zaim recalled
before he left goto gave al zaim a slip of paper with contact information for friends and his wife the mother of his young children
after hearing no word from goto for a week al zaim says called the wife
when i called her she's a very strong woman he said
the aims and activities in syria of yukawa a forty two year old unemployed <unk> are <unk>
he originally headed to the war ravaged country early last year with the aim of gaining combat and survival experience to bolster his plans to set up a private security company said his friend kimoto
there yukawa met goto who gave him insights on how to survive there kimoto said
he also introduced him to rebel fighters who are distinct from isis even though both are fighting against syrian president bashar al assad's forces
some of the rebels talked about their need for ambulances to shuttle the wounded
that plea spurred yukawa to start raising money for this cause after returning to japan according to kimoto
i felt a chill when he said after returning home he felt in syria he was really living a life kimoto said
he seems to have felt satisfaction being there and living together with the locals
yukawa went back to syria in july a trip that kimoto said he didn't know about at the time
kimoto said he had advised his friend to focus on building up his private security company

why countries should think about paying ransoms
the disturbing information comes from a yemeni official who told cnn on wednesday that isis has a presence in at least three provinces in southern and central yemen and there is now a real competition between isis and the yemen based terror group al qaeda in the arabian peninsula or aqap
that competition <unk> itself in a gun battle between the two groups in yemen's eastern provinces last month the same official said though he did not have specifics on the casualties that resulted from that incident
american officials do think isis is trying to recruit in yemen
but one u.s. counter terror official stressed the view that aqap remains the dominant force there
the american intelligence view is that while there may be a <unk> of isis <unk> among sunni extremists in yemen they are likely mid level aqap militants who are sympathetic to <unk> vision but haven't broken ranks
according to some experts isis may be seeking a <unk> in the middle <unk> poorest country because of its historical importance
yemen is significant in islam said <unk> zimmerman a research fellow at the american enterprise institute
it is a place where we've seen attacks against the united states
it also has been a major <unk> for foreign fighters into afghanistan into iraq and now into syria zimmerman added there's a recruiting <unk> that isis may try and tap into
the yemeni official who spoke to cnn said aqap is still the dominant terrorist presence in yemen with hundreds of members compared to dozens for isis
still he added there's a new kid on the block
as violence <unk> seven things to know about yemen
and isis may be using its financial strength to win over some of <unk> potential recruits
the yemeni official told cnn that isis supporters are telling potential recruits they can fund operations better than aqap can at the moment
u.s. officials have long expressed concerns about isis financial strength which it <unk> from the export of stolen oil ransom payments from hostages criminal activities and foreign donors
for this reason the u.s. <unk> department has <unk> aggressive efforts to cut the group off from the international financial system
news of isis <unk> in yemen comes as violence is <unk> through the capital of <unk> where government troops are fighting houthi rebels that are taking control of government facilities
that violence is causing concern within the obama administration who count on the yemeni administration as key allies in the middle east
some institutions of government have broken down and are in trouble u.s. secretary of state john kerry <unk> at a press conference on wednesday
still kerry emphasized that president <unk> <unk> mansour hadi remains in power and u.s. personnel are well protected
the yemeni official tells cnn his government has not noticed significant aqap movement in <unk> during this time which is he said surprising
but <unk> top leaders are still actively plotting the official said and still have ambitions of attacking the west
i think the target as we initially saw is going to be the europeans simply because of their ease to get onto the continent said <unk> <unk> former commander of the <unk>
cole
but ultimately their aim is the united states
the u.s. intelligence community is actively working to track down <unk> leaders according to a u.s. counterterrorism official
these leaders include founder <unk> al wuhayshi and <unk> <unk> ibrahim al <unk> the mastermind of both the christmas day underwear bomb plot in two thousand and nine and a more recent attempt to put bombs in <unk> <unk>
nevertheless the yemeni official cautioned given the pressure aqap has been under in recent months is is now engaging more in its pre two thousand and eleven tactics of <unk> smaller cells and <unk> operatives
their main activities these days are targeted <unk> of houthis and yemeni government and military officials he added
but officials and analysts worry aqap and isis competition in yemen could create a dynamic <unk> the groups compete to strike the u.s. first and hardest
it could lead an attack against the u.s. embassy in <unk> which is vulnerable said zimmerman
and it could also direct its attention <unk> to saudi arabia
these are places to go locals say not no go zones as described by a fox news commentator as well as <unk> gov
<unk> jindal
the last few weeks have seen <unk> of some european cities as <unk> full of muslims areas where a woman without a <unk> might feel too scared to explore areas that police largely avoid and where sharia law rules the day
this <unk> has struck a <unk> in place like the british city of birmingham and the <unk> neighborhood of paris coming on the heels of terror attacks in france that killed seventeen and <unk> worries around europe
it's left some angry <unk> or <unk> <unk> of what to make of it all
who are these people they ask making sweeping <unk> <unk> of their <unk> from thousands of miles away
when i heard this <unk> i <unk> on my <unk> and i thought it was april <unk> day british prime minister david cameron told network <unk> referring specifically to fox news commentator steve <unk> remarks
this guy is clearly a complete idiot
the central english city of birmingham has a long and proud history from stone age era <unk> to roman <unk> to medieval markets and more
today the city is home to more than one million people who partly due to its <unk> are younger than <unk> overall population with forty five point seven percents under age thirty
birmingham is also relatively diverse with about forty two percents of its citizens being not white and twenty two percents born outside the country
in terms of religion just over forty six percents of residents are christian just under twenty two percents are muslim and about nineteen percents have no religion
it is not as <unk> described it earlier this month
there are actually cities like birmingham that are totally muslim where non muslims simply don't go in
this assertion is wrong as <unk> and fox later admitted
but that doesn't mean it didn't <unk>
britain's press association talked to several people in birmingham some of whom called such claims ridiculous others who dismissed them as <unk> and one called it simply ignorant
we are not in <unk> land <unk> mohammed <unk> co owner of the <unk> brothers market founded by pakistani immigrants told the guardian
there are lots of muslims here but this is a <unk> society and there are beautiful links between the different religions
how can they say this
birmingham is one of the stable communities
some <unk> fun at the remarks on twitter with one claiming the british army
sent snow to make birmingham white again and another showing a picture of a <unk> hall called <unk>
<unk> one man
was a bit surprised that i had to convert to the muslim faith before they'd let me off the train at birmingham the other day
birmingham wasn't the only british city caught up in the controversy
so too was the capital london
<unk> for one talked about no go zones around england
and during a speech in london jindal said that in the west non <unk> muslims establish <unk> and carry out as much of sharia law as they can without regard for the laws of the democratic countries which provided them a new home
it is <unk> to think that any country would allow even <unk> for a so called no go zone he said
the idea that a free country would allow for specific areas of its country to operate in an <unk> way that is not free and is in direct opposition to its laws is hard to <unk>
jindal later <unk> down on the comments telling cnn's <unk> foster that there are people here in london that will tell you there are neighborhoods where women don't feel safe
without <unk> and where police are less likely to go
a cnn crew went out to <unk> the london <unk> with the largest muslim population and found people who thought the republican <unk> remarks were not based in reality
they said they felt safe and comfortable in a community that looked like many other parts of the city
this is not something we recognize at all <unk> said
we don't have areas in london that are no go
we don't have areas in london that are sharia law only
and we police all areas of london
this debate unfolded hundreds of miles from the place that got the world talking about it in the first place
paris
that's where two islamist extremists stormed the offices of charlie hebdo magazine january seven leaving twelve dead
a policewoman in the paris suburb of montrouge was killed a day later
the next day the national nightmare <unk> in a pair of raids that killed three terrorists on top of the four civilians dead after a hostage siege at a kosher market in eastern paris
these events and their ties to an extreme <unk> and violent form of islam made what's happening in france a talking point for <unk> worldwide
some of that media <unk> drew the <unk> of french nationals in particular fox news for <unk> comments and <unk> suggesting there are parts of paris and other european cities where islamic law is practiced and where police are <unk> to work
paris mayor <unk> <unk> went so far as to lay out plans to <unk> fox news for having insulted her city
the image of paris has been <unk> she told cnn's christiane amanpour
and the honor of paris has been <unk>
not everyone in france is rallying around charlie hebdo especially after it published a cartoon depicting the prophet mohammed after the attacks
teacher eric <unk> told cnn that many of his muslim students felt the magazine's staff had some responsibility for what happened saying they continued doing what they were doing in full knowledge of the risks
yet even if the entire country isn't on the same page when it comes to the satirical magazine that doesn't mean some places are isolated at least when it comes to police <unk> the streets or whether anyone including women without <unk> feel welcome on them
cnn's <unk> <unk> grew up in the paris neighborhood of <unk> which has a large number of muslims and immigrants
she describes it as a <unk> place where rent is a little cheaper items at the market cost a little less and people feel welcome wherever they come from
people who are there now echo that view saying they feel safe comfortable and happy to live somewhere that people of all <unk> and religions call home
it's no wonder then that some proud french nationals felt <unk> by the idea of <unk> <unk> <unk> on such neighborhoods as dangerous places
others fought back with humor as <unk> in a fake french news show le <unk> journal in which two men <unk> to be fox news reporters are seen on the streets of paris
a graphic on the screen reads paris dangerous city
at one point one of the actors talks about getting in a taxi with a driver who had a muslim beard
oh my god he's a very dangerous islamist
he wants to kill us
a little later on one <unk> as his fellow correspondent goes in and out of a turkish restaurant
john it's too dangerous
come back come back
run away run away the actor screams in <unk> desperation
oh my god <unk>

called the open worm project the research brings together scientists and <unk> from around the world with the aim of <unk> the behavior of the common <unk> in a machine
the open source project recently had its first major breakthrough when its software <unk> on the neurons of the worm's nervous system independently controlled a <unk> robot
the <unk> sensors without any prior <unk> made the robot behave in a similar fashion to <unk> <unk> approaching and backing away from obstacles or <unk> by food
while the <unk> say it will be some time before the <unk> <unk> will be <unk> <unk> or searching for a <unk> scientists say the project shows that artificial intelligence or ai as it is known is coming out of the <unk> of science fiction
we've been working on it for four years and while we have a lot more to achieve it's been the most surprising project i've been involved in project coordinator stephen larson told cnn
it's certainly <unk> my expectations
with the worm's nose neurons replaced by a sonar <unk> and the <unk> neurons running down both sides of the worm <unk> on the left and right <unk> of the <unk> <unk> the robot could <unk> the worm's biological <unk>
larson said that while the open source project is still awaiting peer review and the scientists and researchers in the <unk> are <unk> to make any <unk> claims about how closely it <unk> biological behavior the result were nevertheless impressive
we definitely have further to go but i think what captures people's imagination is how much information we have managed to put together larson said
we know we have the correct number of neurons we have them connected together in roughly the same way that the animal has and they're organized in the same way in that there are some neurons that give out information and other neurons that receive information
we feel we've gone a long way down the road but we still know that there's a lot that's been left out and there are a lot of <unk> at the moment it represents one point in a line of <unk> improvements
i'd say we're only twenty to thirty percents of the way towards where we need to get
the project aims to <unk> model the worm entirely in a virtual environment
creating a robot with an <unk> body complete with <unk> <unk>
something with wheels that is <unk> is an interesting application but it still falls short of <unk> the <unk> of the worm larson said
he said the scientific road map is to model the worm completely <unk> it with the same physics right down to the cells in all the right places
while the <unk> <unk> <unk> was chosen because of the <unk> of its biological structure the complexity of the <unk> has been such that the team has had to narrow down the project to just a third of the worm's neurons <unk> it to those parts of the worm's make up that would display behavior
the digital version of the worm will be released on the web in june this year allowing anyone with an interest to <unk> with the project
larson said the open source and <unk> nature of the project has been key to its success allowing it to make fast progress over the four years of its existence
so far it's had <unk> from more than sixty <unk> from fifteen countries all of them bringing a unique take on the problems thrown up by the project
the project has now split into various sub teams all of them dealing with different elements
one team is looking at the physical and <unk> model while another is <unk> out the neurons and the <unk> and their <unk> models
the great part of the open source <unk> is that the team can take onboard left field suggestions that push it beyond its boundaries
i'd say that this robot was just one of those left field suggestions larson said
a <unk> was able to come along and re use our material put it up online
the fact that it caught so many people's attention was really a bit of a surprise
digital nose on a <unk> can <unk> out cancer
out of <unk>

i apologize to everybody who has felt attacked by my online <unk>
they were comments made without serious reflection which i would no longer express today
i am sorry that i <unk> damaged the interests of our movement and draw the appropriate conclusion bachmann said in dresden
the selfie was an act of satire his spokeswoman <unk> <unk> said on facebook
while every citizen has the right to engage in satire she wrote insulting foreigners is not satirical
though bachmann apparently has <unk> his own facebook account screen <unk> published by numerous media outlets suggest bachmann posted the hitler photo in september while the <unk> image is from two thousand and twelve
bachmann told <unk> i took the photo at the <unk> for the publication of the <unk> of the satire he's back
you need to be able to joke about things now and then
he's back or <unk> <unk> <unk> da in german is a two thousand and twelve best selling satire based on hitler <unk> up in modern day berlin with no knowledge of what happened following world war ii
the <unk> was released long before september as january two thousand and thirteen news reports indicate seventy five thousand copies had already been sold
it appears the images gained <unk> not because of <unk> but because pegida has successfully organized weekly anti islamization demonstrations in dresden
police estimated that eighteen thousand people attended a january five rally while about twenty five thousand people showed up at a january twelve rally
monday's scheduled protest in dresden was canceled after police persuaded pegida to call it off following an isis <unk> targeting <unk> organizers the group wrote on the facebook page for its united kingdom branch
the police has canceled the rally in agreement with pegida because they can't guarantee the security and safety of participants after information of planned attacks by <unk> groups the facebook post said
in response to monday's <unk> <unk> the city of <unk> <unk> of pegida said it was organizing a rally expected to draw between thirty thousand and sixty thousand demonstrators according to german media
as many as four thousand police officers had been recruited from around the country in preparation for the event one news outlet reported
on its main facebook page which has more than one hundred and fifty five thousand likes pegida has stated its philosophy that citizens should wake from their <unk> and recognize the danger in the islamic ideology
stop the radical <unk> islamization it <unk>
as a society we should give people the chance to <unk> but we should not allow ourselves to be <unk> <unk> losing our freedom and democracy
the group claims to have supporters in more than thirty german cities and eighteen countries in europe
a pegida group in norway also called for demonstrators to gather outside town hall in the capital oslo earlier this month to show support for the french and demonstrate opposition to what it calls the <unk> of norway
german justice minister <unk> <unk> and chancellor angela merkel have called on the group to cancel the rallies in dresden and other german cities

<unk> forbrig a european analyst with the german <unk> fund of the united states told cnn that the <unk> message <unk> only in the dresden area where its ideas had fallen on particularly <unk> soil
these protests are not so much fueled by fear of islam and fear of islamist attacks but by frustration at the cost of reunification about the way they are being integrated and represented since the fall of the berlin wall forbrig said
dresden already had a well established network of right wing extremists before <unk> emergence he said
it's more a case of east germans not entirely feeling at home in germany forbrig said
there is a feeling of second class citizenship and in order to be heard many east germans take to radical measures

cell phone footage of the execution <unk> last week by activists gives a rare glimpse into what human rights groups call a barbaric practice of public <unk> as a <unk> measure handed down by saudi arabia's judicial system
the country executed eighty seven people in two thousand and fourteen most by beheading human rights watch told cnn
saudi officials told cnn the punishment is an <unk> part of their system of islamic law and the only violation that took place at the <unk> scene was the illegal filming of the act
the man responsible for the recording now faces charges of violating the country's cyber laws and will be tried a saudi official not authorized to speak on the case said

abdulaziz <unk> a former sharia law judge said
from a pure islamic law point of view there is no <unk> for developing capital punishment
but he said that methods such as <unk> <unk> may be considered in coming years
there is dialogue in the <unk> society that another alternative action can achieve the goal with more mercy and fit better with human rights
a project <unk> by the ruling king abdullah to put laws into writing has <unk> in a shift from the current <unk> system which provides judges with little <unk> or <unk>
this is all part of big issue of division
the sharia court led by conservatives wants to keep the <unk> away from the influence of the political regime so they are very sensitive <unk> says on the other side the modernization has to be achieved and it needs a lot of development in the public policy if you want to develop a way to measure punishment and establish a more <unk> alternative

last friday's print edition of the sun was the last to feature a bare <unk> woman ending one of british <unk> most controversial traditions after forty five years according to the times the <unk> sister paper
the sun refused to confirm the report on tuesday
it's all speculation by people who don't work on the newspaper a spokesman told cnn
we regularly mix it up there's no hard and fast rule
despite the <unk> denial the women featured on the third page of this week's <unk> have indeed covered up model <unk> <unk> <unk> posing in <unk> on monday and <unk> clad soap opera stars <unk> on the beach on tuesday
an <unk> of the most <unk> page in the country would be seen as the end of an era and a victory for critics who have <unk> page three as a <unk> <unk> in a society that has moved on since one thousand nine hundred and seventy when <unk> murdoch launched the feature shortly after <unk> the paper
<unk> <unk> a twenty year old german <unk> was the first to strip off for the paper in november one thousand nine hundred and seventy
page three quickly became an institution and page three girl entered the british <unk>
the <unk> <unk> were credited by some for giving a boost to the <unk> <unk> figures as well as launching the careers of a number of <unk> models over the years including <unk> <unk> <unk> fox and <unk> price
but murdoch had come under increasing pressure since two thousand and twelve when the no more page three campaign whose slogan is <unk> aren't news demanded that the <unk> editors kill the page
the group's online petition has attracted more than two hundred and seventeen thousand <unk> since its launch
murdoch the media <unk> who also owns twenty one st century fox seemed to indicate that change could be on the way when he branded page three old <unk> in a tweet last september
a spokeswoman for no more page three expressed <unk> about the rumors but said the sun needed to go even further
we're really pleased it's a <unk> step in the right direction <unk> <unk> told cnn
it kind of depends a bit as well what they replace it with if it continues to be women in <unk> then it's still women being <unk> and we don't really think there's any place for that in a national newspaper so the campaign will continue
<unk> also had her own idea for what page three could feature in the future
i'd love to see a celebration of women the <unk> in a really unique position here where they could turn things around after forty five years of giving us <unk> images
they could celebrate women in sport or some other way in which women contribute to society
no more page three was launched by <unk> <unk> <unk> in the summer of two thousand and twelve after the writer and actress noticed that the largest female image in the sun newspaper was of a young woman showing her <unk> for men even though <unk> <unk> had won her tremendous gold <unk> in the london olympics
although <unk> shots may no longer grace the <unk> print edition the group's campaign is far from over
the tradition lives on at the <unk> page three website and the daily star another british <unk> was still featuring naked models on page three as of tuesday
boko haram kidnapped german citizen robert <unk> eberhard in nigeria in july <unk> said in a statement read wednesday on state run broadcaster <unk>
he did not detail how when or where the rescue operation took place
a special operation of cameroonian armed forces and security services of friendly countries freed the man he said
eberhard told journalists he was glad to be alive
i am happy to see all these people around me who have rescued me and made sure that i survived because until the last minute i did not know whether i would survive or i would not survive
it was for me a big problem
because it was darkness total darkness and you see nobody around you
then this is a big problem to say ok i will survive or not survive eberhard said
eberhard was flown in from <unk> far north region to <unk> shortly after <unk> wednesday
he said he was grateful to all those who worked to secure his release
the german ambassador to cameroon <unk> <unk> <unk> also thanked cameroonian authorities particularly because we could find a solution to this problem of hostage taking he said
eberhard spoke amid heavy security and mentioned that he was teaching at a <unk> school in gombe <unk> state nigeria before the insurgents took him hostage in july
he has been taken to the residence of the german ambassador in <unk>
the ambassador said initial medical care will be given to him before he is flown back to germany for more medical attention
<unk> said he was <unk> to all those who directly or <unk> helped in the achievement
and particularly the german government for their precious contribution
he did not specify how germany participated
the german foreign office did not immediately respond to cnn's request for comment
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of the african union commission praised the decision of president <unk> <unk> <unk> of chad at the request of cameroon to <unk> troops in that country to contribute to the ongoing operations against the boko haram terrorist group
boko haram which has fought an anti government campaign in northeastern nigeria and parts of cameroon said previously that it was holding a german hostage
boko haram leader <unk> <unk> said so in november in a video message denying nigeria's claims that it had struck a ceasefire deal with the group
it wasn't immediately clear if this was eberhard
the operation came days after about two thousand chadian troops arrived in cameroon to help fight the insurgents
boko haram which means western education is forbidden in the local <unk> <unk> has terrorized northern nigeria regularly since two thousand and nine attacking police schools churches and civilians and bombing government buildings
it has kidnapped students including more than two hundred schoolgirls who were abducted in northeastern nigeria in april and remain missing
the islamist group has attacked neighboring cameroon initially by crossing the border from nigeria to <unk> food or kidnap foreign nationals
more recently the group went after cameroonian military installations
on sunday suspected boko haram militants kidnapped eighty people in <unk> far north region officials in the country said
by monday a military operation had freed twenty four of the captives
three others were found dead state run media reported
boko haram has said its aim is to impose a stricter form of sharia law across nigeria which is split between a majority muslim north and a mostly christian south
<unk> has called for international cooperation in the fight against boko haram
last week the russian ambassador to cameroon <unk> <unk> said his country will supply cameroon with modern and sophisticated military weapons including heavy artillery armored cars and missiles
michael stephen <unk> u.s. ambassador to cameroon said the united states would help train cameroon soldiers and offer equipment for the fight
democracy freedom of religion and speech are gifts that help <unk> what it means to be fully human
but within any democracy there must exist a level of respectful restraint when challenging or <unk> <unk> religious values of the other
the islamic <unk> of not depicting the prophet mohammed in any human image is a sacred element of islam
for anyone muslim or non muslim to do so is to <unk> and <unk> a basic <unk> of the faith
what has happened <unk> in france has provided other terrorists using religion as their <unk> and <unk> calling card with a <unk> to kill in the name of god
the end result of this latest slaughter is the construction of a global arena <unk> freedom of speech against a time honored understanding of how to <unk> the presence of the prophet mohammed in the world
those who <unk> abuse <unk> and kill using religion as the rationale for their actions are neither religious nor <unk> to their <unk> roots
theirs is a desire to <unk> muslims christians and jews against one another in a religious war that will <unk> years of hard won respectful <unk> dialogue between the three great <unk> faiths
dialogue that has a place in creating a more <unk> and <unk> world
theirs is a desire to <unk> the genius of democracy freedom of speech and religion to create a false image of islam as a violent <unk> religion
nothing could be further from the truth
it is important to honor the lives lost in france and to remember that those murdered were jews christians and a muslim
terrorists kill not only for their own sick <unk> motives but to create an environment where violence and hate will <unk> peace and reconciliation between the faiths
they endeavor to show that democracy and freedom of speech have no place in their <unk> understanding of the islamic world
je suis charlie is a phrase shared by millions yet we all must understand that with freedom of speech must also come a sense of respectful restraint in criticizing or <unk> the <unk> or values of another especially their religion during these <unk> filled times where sectarian violence is trying to rule the day
my <unk> colleague and nobel <unk> <unk> <unk> tutu of south africa reminded me that the essence of being human is contained in the african word <unk> a person can only be a person through <unk> with another i am because you are
we can only be fully human when we are bound by trust mutual respect and <unk> the human dignity of another person
it is only by <unk> and embracing the other that we can be touched by the very hand of god made whole and made a new creation
it is only then that we can extend our reach beyond our <unk> and begin to change the future of humanity in a culture of peace
at this moment in time christianity islam and judaism have a great opportunity to work together effectively with governments and civil societies currently in turmoil
the <unk> faiths have the opportunity to re shape the world into a culture of peace rather than a world torn <unk> by violence extremism and political <unk>
christianity islam and judaism must become the bridge <unk> of this century to span the raging waters of human conflict
it is pure <unk> that has given birth to human behavior sustained by fear and hate rather than by love of god love of self and love of neighbor
it is this <unk> that takes the <unk> love of god for all human beings <unk> it and <unk> it into pieces of human interpretation that bear no <unk> to the core teachings of the one god of christianity islam and judaism as we know them
no person has the right to take the life of another person in the name of god
human beings who claim to represent the true teachings of christianity islam and judaism and who <unk> slaughter those who are the other have lost the most fundamental principle of their religious <unk> <unk>
they have lost the core of a <unk> and loving god
there is no fear in love but perfect love <unk> out fear
for fear has to do with punishment
and whoever fears has not reached <unk> in love
those who say
i love god and hate their brothers and sisters who they have seen can not love god who they have not seen
the <unk> that we have from him is this
those who love god must love their brothers and sisters
rabbi jonathan <unk> wrote
i believe that we are being <unk> by god to see in the human other a face of the divine other
the test so <unk> failed by the great powers of the twenty th century is to see the divine presence in the face of the stranger
to <unk> the cry of those who are <unk> in the age of unprecedented powers
who are hungry and poor and ignorant and <unk> whose human potential is being denied the chance to be expressed
that is the faith of <unk> and sarah who with the great faiths judaism christianity and islam trace their spiritual or actual <unk>
war sectarian violence and terrorism are <unk> of human failure
for all who follow the teachings of the prophets jesus and mohammed who will now stand firm and commit themselves to end all acts of violence and extremism done in the name of god
if not us then who
while these cases are extremely rare it does beg the question of why gaming can lead to such excessive behavior
i have spent nearly three decades studying <unk> addiction and there are many studies published in both the medical and psychological literature showing that very excessive gaming can lead to a variety of health problems that range from <unk> strain injuries and <unk> through to <unk> and visual <unk> and addiction
i have to stress that there is lots of scientific research showing the many educational and <unk> benefits of playing but there is definitely a small minority of gamers that develop problems as a result of gaming <unk>
but what is it that makes gaming so <unk> and <unk> for the small minority
for me addiction <unk> down to constant <unk> or put more simply being constantly <unk> while playing the game
gaming <unk> can be <unk> psychological social and in some cases financial
most of these <unk> are at least to some extent unpredictable
not knowing when the next reward will come keeps some players in the game
in short they carry on gaming even though they may not have received an immediate reward
they simply hope that another reward is just around the corner and keep on playing
added to this is the shift over the last decade from <unk> <unk> gaming to <unk> <unk> online games where games never end and gamers have to compete and or <unk> with other gamers in real time
many excessive gamers report that they hate <unk> off and leaving such games
they don't like it as they don't know what is going on in the game when they are not online
the last five years has seen large increase in the number of scientific studies on <unk> gaming
in may two thousand and thirteen the american <unk> association published the fifth edition of the <unk> and <unk> <unk> of mental <unk>
for the first time the <unk> five included internet gaming <unk> as a psychological condition that <unk> future research
throughout my research career i have argued that although all <unk> have particular and <unk> characteristics they share more <unk> than differences such as total <unk> mood <unk> <unk> tolerance withdrawal symptoms conflict with work education and other people and loss of control
these <unk> likely reflect a common <unk> of <unk> behavior
so when does a healthy enthusiasm turn into an addiction
at the <unk> level healthy <unk> add to life and <unk> take away from it
but how much is too much
this is difficult to answer as i know many gamers who play many hours every day without any <unk> effects
the <unk> five lists nine <unk> for <unk>
if any <unk> <unk> five or more of the following <unk> they would likely be diagnosed as having <unk>
<unk> with internet games
withdrawal symptoms when internet gaming is taken away
the need to spend increasing amounts of time engaged in internet gaming unsuccessful attempts to control participation in internet gaming
loss of interest in <unk> and entertainment as a result of and with the exception of internet gaming
continued excessive use of internet games despite knowledge of <unk> problems
<unk> of family members <unk> or others regarding the amount of internet gaming
use of the internet gaming to escape or <unk> a negative mood
and loss of a significant relationship job or educational or career opportunity because of participation in internet games
the good news is that only a small minority of gamers suffer form <unk>
most online games are fun and exciting to play
but like any activity that is taken to excess in a minority of cases the activity can become <unk>
any activity if done for days on end could lead to severe health problems and even death and gaming is no exception
instead of <unk> games we need to educate gamers about the potential dangers of very excessive use
unfortunately even with the <unk> of living in a camp these kids are still some of the lucky ones
after all at least half of syrian refugee children aren't even in school
indeed if syrian refugees were a country they would have the lowest rate of educational <unk> in the world
and without access to quality education children here are at risk of not having the skills they need as adults
all this means that syria is facing a lost generation
why is all this happening
because the civil war is <unk> syrian society
the united nations announced earlier this month that syrians are now the largest refugee population in the world more than seven point five million syrians are displaced internally while another three point two million are registered refugees in neighboring countries
that's nearly half of syria's total population
and while lebanon turkey jordan iraq and egypt have been <unk> generous hosts the <unk> is so large that it's changing some countries <unk> with refugees <unk> at least twenty percents of <unk> population ten percents of jordan's and ten to twenty percents of border areas in turkey according to the state department and <unk>
meanwhile more than eighty percents of the refugees <unk> in urban areas not camps and so rely on urban services placing high demands on schools
all this is leaving education in crisis across the host countries
while each country officially allows syrian children access to the public education system <unk> remain including school space shortages having to learn new languages transportation the need for children to work for their family's survival and <unk>
in addition many are putting off school in the belief that their return to syria is imminent
this <unk> very real risks to the quality of education for both host country nationals and syrian children
the presence of refugees has meant crowded classrooms and <unk> <unk> and it leaves teachers managing students who are at different levels
continuous investment in these countries education systems is therefore important so that the quality of education doesn't fall backwards
sadly there's no end in sight for syria's civil war
and even when peace is re established it will take years before many syrians can return to their homes given the destroyed infrastructure and <unk> tensions within society
this isn't unique to the current situation
in <unk> refugee crises around the world the average time until refugees can return home is seventeen years according to the united nations
the responsibility for providing formal <unk> twelve education for refugees lies primarily with the host governments some of which are taking loans to cover the <unk>
but while much of the international assistance response has so far been humanitarian responding to urgent needs what's needed now is a transition toward development planning in which longer term sustainable solutions for education and other sectors are planned and <unk>
this means investing in building <unk> of host country governments to provide education to these additional people in the future
<unk> funding will dry up over time and the host governments will need systems to manage the additional children they must educate
moving forward host countries and the international aid community should <unk> investment in access to quality education with additional attention to building infrastructure to expand school spaces understanding and addressing other <unk> to access developing transportation options improving data systems expanding school monitoring and support and providing teacher training about refugee needs in the classroom
this will also <unk> an investment in the longer term education development needs of the host countries meaning they'll benefit too
the suffering that has taken place in syria since the civil war started in two thousand and eleven has been almost <unk>
but by investing in the country's future in this way the international community can help ensure education isn't another casualty of the war
and perhaps help lay the foundations for a <unk> future
time is running out
isis put out a video tuesday giving the japanese government seventy two hours to pay two hundred million dollar or else kenji goto and haruna yukawa like other isis captives before them will be killed
japanese chief cabinet secretary <unk> suga said wednesday that his government estimates the deadline will come at two fifty p.m. friday tokyo time
until then he said japanese officials are trying to save them
suga said his government will do its utmost to communicate with isis on the fate of goto and yukawa through a third party such as another nation's government or a local tribe
he didn't say whether japan would be willing to pay any ransom
<unk> such a private back and forth the japanese official voiced his government's stance publicly including its defense of a proposed aid package also <unk> at two hundred million dollar to help those who are <unk> with isis according to prime minister shinzo abe
abe has defended the aid package as needed to build up human <unk> infrastructure and so on yet isis <unk> it anyway in its recent video
japan's measures are absolutely not intending to kill muslim people unlike what the hostage takers claim suga said wednesday
we strongly urge them not to harm the two japanese nationals and immediately release them
goto and yukawa were last seen months ago disappearing in the same part of the world
while they had different <unk> the two knew and talked to each other said yukawa's friend <unk> kimoto
it was january two thousand and fourteen when kimoto met yukawa who told him about his dream of providing security for japanese ships in dangerous areas such as waters off somalia sometimes <unk> by <unk>
three months later yukawa headed off to syria to gain combat and survival experience kimoto said
there yukawa met the man isis refers to as kenji goto <unk>
goto is a freelance journalist who has worked for various japanese news organizations including reporting about the northern syrian <unk> city of kobani which for weeks has been under siege by isis and other areas
goto gave yukawa insights on how to survive there kimoto said
he also introduced him to rebel fighters distinct from isis even though both were fighting against syrian president bashar al assad's forces some of whom talked about their need for ambulances to shuttle the injured
that plea spurred yukawa to start raising money for this cause after returning to japan according to his friend kimoto
i felt a chill when he said after returning home he felt in syria he was really living a life kimoto said
he seems to have felt satisfaction being there and living together with the locals
he went back to syria in july a trip that kimoto said he didn't know about at the time
kimoto said he had advised yukawa to focus on building up his private military company which provided armed security services and posted videos online of his activities in iraq and syria
yukawa forty two went missing and was captured <unk> after that
goto met the same fate
while it's not known exactly when he became a hostage his last twitter post was on october twenty three
<unk> al zaim worked as a <unk> for goto
speaking to cnn in turkey he said the journalist had reached out to him about going into isis controlled territory
i am not american i am not british
i'm japanese
i can go goto told the <unk>
<unk> help reporters travel and connect with local contacts
al zaim refused <unk> the trip was too dangerous
another <unk> agreed to take goto to isis al zaim said
before he left goto made a short video which cnn saw in which he explained his decision to travel was his and his alone
goto gave al zaim his phones and a list of numbers
he gave me this and asked me to call japanese wife his wife in japan his friends in japan
after one week if i don't hear any news of them or any connection i have to call them said al zaim who remembers seeing goto for the last time on october twenty five
after a week he said he hadn't heard from goto and so he made the call to his wife
al zaim who described goto as his brother praised his reporting work
he is the best journalist i met him and i work with him because he like military stories
he covered every time civilian and kids stories in syria
and also he is very strong
<unk> he want to do his job very well
sometimes we are going to danger places he afraid
he tell me
this is my job
i am journalist
i have to do that
cnn could not immediately confirm the details of what al zaim said
what happens next for both men is up to isis
unfortunately it doesn't have a record of showing much mercy
the islamist militant group has been behind mass killings and kidnappings during its years long campaign to take over vast swaths of iraq and syria attempting to justify its actions like <unk> and having sex with young girls as somehow consistent with its extreme conservative faith
taking hostages from outside countries has been part of its <unk>
not only has isis beheaded many of them but it's made a show of it by recording their deaths and showing them online as propaganda something that began in august with the killing of u.s. journalist james foley
those beheaded hostages were american and british both from countries involved in a military campaign against isis
japan is allies with both though it is not participating in any airstrikes or the training or <unk> of those fighting the militant group
<unk> stance on the conflict including the two hundred million dollar pledge that abe made sunday was apparently enough to draw the <unk> of the group that calls itself the islamic state
although you are more than eight thousand five hundred kilometers away from the islamic state you <unk> volunteered to take part in this <unk> said the masked man who stood over goto and yukawa in tuesday's video addressing his comments to abe
abe has responded by defending the proposed aid and <unk> isis threat against two of his nation's citizens as unacceptable
i feel angry about it he said tuesday
i strongly urge them to immediately release the hostages without <unk> them

valls announcement comes as europe <unk> up efforts against islamist extremism in the wake of the paris attacks
the attacks this month against the satirical charlie hebdo magazine and a kosher supermarket have turned the spotlight on links between radical islamists in europe and terror networks elsewhere
al qaeda's yemen affiliate al qaeda in the arabian peninsula has claimed to be behind the january seven massacre by gunmen said and cherif kouachi at the offices of charlie hebdo

from antwerp to aleppo and back
europe's nightmare

if he is capable to wage individual jihad in the western countries that fight islam such as america britain france canada and others of the countries that represent the head of <unk> in waging war against islam
if he is capable of that then that is better and more harmful said nasr ibn ali al ansi
he continued
but if that is impossible and he is able to serve his brothers on the front lines then let him <unk> for it is better
an off camera <unk> asked why attacks have <unk> in the united states
by the grace of allah the great the <unk> we have made efforts in external work and the enemy knows the danger of that al ansi said
we are preparing and <unk> for the enemies of allah
we <unk> the believers to do that
paris prosecutor franois molins told a news conference that progress has been made in the investigation into the attack carried out by coulibaly but less so in the probe into the kouachi brothers

amid heightened concern over the threat posed by radical islamists in europe belgium and germany have <unk> down on alleged extremists in recent days
belgian authorities continue the hunt for the ringleader behind a terrorist cell targeted in <unk> raids last week in which two suspects died
the suspected key link between senior isis operatives in syria and the belgian terrorist cell belgian moroccan isis fighter <unk> abaaoud is still at large a senior belgian counterterrorism official said monday
his last known location was greece the official said
one line of inquiry being looked at is whether abaaoud tried to fake his own death last year while fighting with isis in syria so that he could disappear off the radar screen of western intelligence services
in october his family in brussels received word he had been <unk> his sister told a belgian newspaper
belgian investigators believe abaaoud rather than dying on the front lines traveled to greece and suspect he was <unk> by phone from there with the terrorist cell in belgium
despite an international manhunt involving both american and european intelligence agencies abaaoud remains at large
the concern is he will return to syria before he can found
the belgian prosecutor's office meanwhile said wednesday that custody had been extended for three suspects arrested in last thursday's raids
all three are charged with participation at the activities of a terrorist group and violation of weapons laws
one is also charged with armed rebellion in a group with <unk>
that last is <unk> el bali who survived the police raid in verviers in which two suspects died
his attorney said he was not involved in terrorism but was simply in the wrong place at the wrong time
the greek authorities have also agreed to the extradition of an algerian suspect named as omar s. the belgian prosecutor's office said
the extradition could take place in the following days
when he <unk> in belgium he will be brought before the investigating judge who will decide on an arrest warrant the prosecutor's office said
another suspect named as <unk> <unk> was arrested tuesday and charged with participation in the activities of a terrorist group
he's due to appear before a brussels court on friday the prosecutor's office said
federal prosecutor eric van der sypt said last week that the alleged terror cell targeted in the <unk> raids was on the brink of an attack and planned to target police officers
meanwhile police in berlin <unk> and <unk> raided thirteen properties linked to suspected radical islamists overnight monday to tuesday
the raids are part of the investigation into two alleged islamists who were arrested friday identified as <unk> <unk> and <unk> f. berlin police said
both of them are accused of providing logistical aid to isis
those subject to the raids have not yet been accused of any crimes but had contact with <unk> <unk> and <unk> f. there are no indications that the group was preparing attacks in germany
coulibaly killed four hostages at the kosher grocery store in paris before police killed him
he's also believed to have killed a policewoman a day earlier
new surveillance video obtained by cnn purportedly shows coulibaly and hayat boumedienne believed currently to be in syria outside a jewish institution in paris
a source familiar with the ongoing investigation into the paris attacks says there is a high degree of confidence that the video shows coulibaly and boumedienne
the video was recorded at the end of august or beginning of september and stored on a security camera
the source says the nature of the video makes it clear that the couple were carrying out surveillance of possible targets for months before coulibaly launched his attack against the kosher supermarket
the video was stored because it showed possible signs of unusual activity at the location says the source

almost two thousand years later researchers may be on the brink of reading some of the <unk> scrolls damaged in the <unk>
the scrolls which were buried in a <unk> library and <unk> two hundred and sixty years ago are easily damaged or destroyed by <unk> so researchers have been unable to read them without risk
but by using <unk> ray phase contrast <unk> a three <unk> technique used in medicine for soft biological tissue they have been able to reveal writing on the <unk> wrapped scrolls without <unk> them wrote a team led by <unk> <unk> of the <unk> based institute for <unk> and <unk> of the national council of research
their research was described in the journal nature communications
this attempt opens up new opportunities to read many <unk> <unk> which are still <unk> up thus <unk> our knowledge of ancient greek literature and philosophy they wrote
the <unk> library which was <unk> in the one thousand seven hundred and fifty s is the only ancient library to survive with its books the researchers point out
the scrolls are primarily <unk> texts
the team looked at two scrolls given to napoleon in one thousand eight hundred and two burnt by <unk> <unk> reaching about six hundred degrees fahrenheit and were able to <unk> a handful of greek letters through the <unk> ray technology
though difficult to make out the letters are there in relief because the <unk> is still on the top <unk> told the bbc
there's still a long way to go to completely read the texts of the scrolls but scholars are optimistic
one of them the university of <unk> richard <unk> told the new york times we might find works thought lost to history
this technology when <unk> does open the way to <unk> a lot more ancient literature he said
the french government decided to award citizenship to the malian born twenty four year old supermarket employee after he <unk> his own life to hide customers from hostage taker amedy coulibaly earlier this month
four people lost their lives in the hostage taking and shooting at the kosher grocery store
but the fifteen people whom bathily led <unk> to hide in a walk in freezer stayed safe
bathily who describes himself as a practicing muslim told cnn affiliate bfmtv he switched off the freezer turned off the lights and told everyone to stay calm
he went upstairs following orders from the hostage taker but managed to run outside and tell police about the situation in the store
in his opening speech at the ceremony tuesday evening cazeneuve praised bathily's gesture of courage and humanity which had become the symbol of an islam of peace and tolerance
bathily who arrived in france when he was sixteen had dreamed of gaining french citizenship since his childhood
today this dream is becoming true a bit faster than expected cazeneuve said
valls also paid tribute to the courage of the young man
with you and with all the people in this room the prime minister said we just saw one of the most beautiful images of our country
valls also recalled the strong ties between france and mali a country which saw <unk> being <unk> by terrorists and which received french support in its fight against <unk>
the french military has been involved in fighting islamist extremists in mali and the wider <unk> region since early two thousand and thirteen
both valls and cazeneuve emphasized the importance of keeping french citizenship open in order to remain <unk> to the republican ideal
welcoming new french citizens is an opportunity for the country as well as for those who become french valls said
bathily then took the floor
i thank you with all my heart for <unk> me french citizenship
i am proud and moved the young man said
people think i am a hero but i am not
i am just lassana
at the end of the ceremony bathily received his passport together with a letter from president francois hollande and the citizenship <unk> distributed to all new french citizens
coulibaly the terrorist killed in the police operation that ended the supermarket attack also had roots in mali
but unlike bathily he was born in france and had french citizenship
the terrorist explained that they would be executed in seventy two hours if isis isn't paid two hundred million dollar
japanese prime minister shinzo abe responded on tuesday saying the treatment of the hostages was unacceptable
isis had similarly demanded one hundred million euros in ransom for the release of james foley the american journalist who was killed by the terrorist group in syria in august
like the two hundred million dollar demand for the japanese hostages the foley demand was never a serious negotiation effort as it far <unk> the amounts of money paid for hostages held by jihadist militant groups in the past which typically have <unk> up to several million dollars
but the demand does <unk> a light on two uncomfortable facts about kidnap and ransom or <unk> the dark <unk> of professionals who work to negotiate between <unk> groups such as isis and the terrified families whose loved ones have been kidnapped
it also includes their worried <unk> and western governments such as france that will pay ransoms and other governments notably the united states and the united kingdom that will not
the first uncomfortable fact is that if you pay a ransom a hostage is more likely to be released
the other is that every time a ransom is paid it increases the chance that other hostages will be taken to help fill the <unk> of a terrorist group
according to an investigation by the new york times al qaeda and its affiliates have <unk> at least one hundred and twenty five million dollar in ransoms since two thousand and eight
that finding is similar to a two thousand and twelve u.s. <unk> estimate that one hundred and twenty million dollar had been paid to terrorist organizations during the previous eight years
much of this revenue reportedly comes from france
french media reported that the government had paid twenty million euros for the release of four employees of a french nuclear firm
they were held by an al qaeda affiliate for three years in northern niger and were released last year
the french government denied paying a ransom but the new york times indicated based on reports from le monde and agence france presse that france did pay in that case and has paid out a total of some fifty eight million dollar to al qaeda or related groups
opinion
why countries should think about paying ransoms
not <unk> the times also found that of the fifty three hostages known to have been taken by al qaeda and its affiliates during the past five years a third were french
the french government's purported policy of negotiating with militant groups for the release of kidnapped citizens does appear to work
four french journalists <unk> <unk> pierre <unk> <unk> <unk> and didier franois who were kidnapped in syria last year by isis were released near the turkish border in april <unk> and with their hands bound
one of those hostages <unk> had been held by isis alongside foley
<unk> is free and foley is dead
these are the facts that <unk> must confront as they consider what to do about the other western hostages still held by isis
so far isis has executed a number of western hostages including american journalist steven sotloff and u.s. aid worker peter kassig
isis continues to holds one american female aid worker
cnn is <unk> her name
for the hostages held by isis there is always the chance that their governments will mount a rescue operation as the united states did in syria in july two thousand and fourteen to try and rescue foley and the other americans
that mission failed because the hostages had been moved from a location they had been kept in for some months
there is also the possibility that hostages could escape as american photographer matthew <unk> did last year when he managed to <unk> out of a window of the prison where he was being held in in the syrian city of aleppo by an islamist militant group
but such <unk> are rare and while successful rescue efforts do happen they are <unk> with risks for the hostages
<unk> <unk> for instance a british aid worker held by the taliban in afghanistan in two thousand and ten was killed in a u.s. rescue operation likely by a <unk> that exploded near her
if there's not an escape or a successful rescue effort western governments whose citizens are held by isis have only the options of either a negotiation involving ransom or the real possibility that their hostages may be executed
this is the <unk> choice that has faced president barack obama and his national security <unk> and now faces the japanese prime minister
last year obama ordered a review of u.s. hostage policy which is never to negotiate with terrorists
the review is reportedly supposed to examine issues such as family <unk> intelligence collection and diplomatic <unk> policies
but that seems to be rather missing the point
the real issue is
will a ransom be paid or not
an area of possible <unk> room would be to leave the door open so that ransoms for americans could be allowed to be paid not with u.s. government funds but with private donations
in such a case the government would simply look the other way when private donations were used to free an american hostage as paying money to a designated terrorist organization is a crime in the states
this is the least bad solution to a terrible <unk> which is if that if you don't pay the ransom the hostage <unk> and if you do pay the ransom you are helping a terrorist organization
she was stabbed in the head
go to <unk> street the <unk> shouted
a man stabbed nine people including the driver of a bus and passengers on wednesday in what police are calling a terror attack
the girl was she <unk>
the nine hundred and eleven operator asked
yes yes she is crying she is <unk> the <unk> answered
the attacker was a twenty three year old palestinian from the west bank city of <unk> authorities said
police shot him in the leg after he got off the bus
he was arrested and is being questioned they said
the suspect was identified as <unk> <unk> said israeli authorities and the suspect's family
his uncle ahmad <unk> said his nephew lives with his mother in the west bank city of ramallah
the suspect's father lives in another west bank city <unk> where the uncle was interviewed by cnn
<unk> has no political <unk> the uncle said
we were called by the israeli military to come in for questioning
his father mother and myself we went and they were asking us about his political <unk>
we said that <unk> never had any political <unk>
when asked what could be a <unk> for the suspect's attack the uncle said it was because of what he sees of suffering of the palestinians by israel
the daily attacks by the extremist jews and israelis on the <unk> mosque and especially this summer the killing of more than two thousand one hundred palestinians by israel in gaza
the suspect works as an <unk> supporting his mother and his younger brothers the uncle said
he came to see his father last night and his friends last night and he was in his nature nothing suspicious the uncle said
the uncle said his nephew born in late one thousand nine hundred and ninety two was age twenty two not twenty three as authorities reported
israeli authorities couldn't be immediately reached for comment to <unk> the suspect's age but a government website stated the suspect was born in one thousand nine hundred and ninety two was originally from <unk> and had no prior arrests
witnesses and police say that when the attacker boarded the bus and stabbed the driver and a few passengers the driver tried to fight back by spraying the <unk> with <unk> spray <unk> the bus <unk> the <unk> and opening the doors
some passengers were able to get out and get away
the attacker ran after them and stabbed a few people on his way out of the bus
prison guards who were in their car behind the bus got out of their vehicle and <unk> the <unk> witnesses and police said
the attacker was shot in the leg and <unk>
four victims were seriously wounded according to emergency <unk>
five people were either lightly or <unk> injured emergency services said
several other passengers were treated for shock
one person was severely injured officials told cnn and the attacker remains in moderate condition at a tel aviv hospital
the terror of the victims and the chaos during the attack was captured in other nine hundred and eleven calls
an injured woman can be heard telling an operator my body is covered with blood
in a separate call another woman says i have here a wounded man who is heavily bleeding someone has to come for help he is bleeding from the head from his neck that is what i see
the operator tells her to find a clean piece of <unk> and press it against the man's wounds
a hamas spokesman <unk> al <unk> who is based in qatar praised the attack according to the times of israel and <unk>
the <unk> stabbing incident against the <unk> in tel aviv is a daring and <unk> act he reportedly said
it comes as a natural response to the terrorist occupation crimes against our people
israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu fired back <unk> a net of blame around hamas and the palestinian authority which together form a unity government
the terrorist attack in tel aviv is the direct result of the <unk> <unk> being <unk> by the palestinian authority against the jews and their state
this same terrorism is trying to attack us in paris brussels and everywhere
the u.s. embassy in israel on its website said that due to security concerns on israel's northern border all u.s. government personnel must get advance approval to travel within one point five miles of the lebanese border or east of route ninety eight in the golan heights
and it said in light of the bus attack u.s. government employees are prohibited from using public buses throughout israel and the west bank
there has been a string of attacks against israeli residents in recent months
here is a look at a few of them
a palestinian man threw acid on an israeli family near a jerusalem checkpoint in december israeli authorities said
a teenage palestinian girl with a knife stabbed an israeli man in the west bank israeli police said
two palestinian <unk> stormed a jerusalem synagogue in mid november with a gun and <unk> <unk> killing five
they were shot dead by police
days later israeli authorities said they foiled a plot by palestinians to <unk> israeli foreign minister <unk> <unk>
more than a week earlier attackers stabbed one israeli soldier to death in tel aviv and three more israelis near a west bank settlement the idf said
one of the west bank victims also died
in early november a palestinian man driving a van <unk> into pedestrians at a train stop in eastern jerusalem killing two
another twelve people were injured
the man died in police gunfire after also attacking people with a metal bar police said
in october a palestinian man rammed his car into <unk> waiting at a light rail stop in jerusalem killing a baby and wounding several other people israeli police said
the driver of the vehicle was shot as he tried to flee and later died
also in october according to a palestinian state news report an israeli man killed a five year old palestinian girl when he ran her down in a car as she walked home from <unk>
the attack reportedly also injured a second five year old girl
the rebels have agreed to release the president's chief of staff and withdraw their militias from key government institutions if officials take a significant step
<unk> parts of the country's constitution according to a yemeni official with access to a draft text of the peace deal
under the terms of the agreement the government will accept changes in the draft of the new constitution that would grant the houthis more political power
word of the deal still leaves many questions unanswered
what could the <unk> constitution look like
how much power will the rebels get
and how much control will president abdu rabu mansour hadi have
houthi rebels shiite muslims who have long felt marginalized in the majority sunni country abducted the president's chief of staff over the weekend then took over the presidential palace in sanaa on tuesday
one government minister called it the <unk> of a coup but rebels said they had not asked the president to step down
the chaos in yemen is cause for concern far beyond the country's borders
for the united states and its allies yemen's government has been a key ally in the fight against al qaeda in the arabian peninsula the yemen based group linked to attacks such as the recent slaughter at french magazine charlie hebdo
aqap also tried to blow up a plane landing in detroit in two thousand and nine
isis is also recruiting in yemen to expand its ranks
and questions over who's in charge over the past few days have sparked concerns that a power vacuum could help terrorist groups get a stronger <unk>
but the deal <unk> wednesday could signal a return to stability said mohammed <unk> a spokesman for the yemeni embassy in washington
the situation is <unk>
it's critical
the government was <unk>
parts of the government <unk> but we did not reach the point of no return he told cnn's the situation room
things are difficult but there are things that are moving forward
several of the constitutional changes sought by the houthis would <unk> the characteristics of yemen as a federal state and push for more <unk> of diverse groups
the houthis call for marginalized political groups to have the right to <unk> in state institutions and fair representation according to the text of the tentative agreement
in return for these government <unk> the rebels basically agree to withdraw their fighters from the capital
the rebels control or have <unk> several government installations
the presidential palace the presidential residence the prime minister's residence and a military <unk> where missiles are housed
under the agreement the houthis would withdraw from all of these sites
the rebels would cooperate with the government so that the president and state institutions can return to their <unk> and would urge all state employees to return to their jobs
a houthi official said the rebels will abide by the deal if the president follows a <unk> <unk> in the negotiations
this deal draws the road map for the political process going forward with the participation of all factions in yemen
in the past <unk> were not respected who hope this time will be different a member of the houthi political council said
this isn't the first time the rebels and the government have <unk> out an agreement
houthis swept into the capital last year <unk> battles that left more than three hundred dead in a month
in september they signed a ceasefire deal with the government and houthis have since installed themselves in key positions in the government and financial institutions
like them or not <unk> said the houthis aren't going anywhere and are part of the yemeni political structure
they are now a fact of life
they are now a dominant force in many of the northern provinces he said
we're going to have to <unk> and live with them
for days the answers to questions about who's in charge of the country have <unk> depending on who you ask
even as rebel <unk> stepped up their presence outside the presidential palace a yemeni official told cnn the president does not consider himself a captive
the official said the houthis were assisting hadi's security detail in their protection mission because part of the detail had run away yesterday because of the fighting
a senior leader of the houthi resistance movement abdullah <unk> gave a similar account
he told cnn that the president's personal security left him which forced us to gather hundreds of fighters from our security to ensure he is safe
<unk> the actual balance of power the official said the houthis demands were clear and nobody can hide that they are the dominant force but they still recognize government power
besides the confusion about who is at the <unk> in yemen the rebels seized military installations it says it will return under the agreement
two houthi field commanders told cnn that rebels had seized control of a massive weapons <unk> belonging to the government <unk> that provides presidential personal security
the houthis had control of two hundred and eighty t eighty russian made tanks and other heavy artillery the field commanders said
while most of the security forces reportedly fled after a light <unk> with militants the houthis said they captured at least twelve special forces soldiers
on wednesday houthi rebels surrounded a yemeni missile <unk> in <unk> a suburb east of sanaa
the <unk> is not under control of the rebels but they have it surrounded the field commanders and two government officials said
the houthis said their objective is not to take over the missile <unk> but to keep missiles from being moved elsewhere
seven things to know about yemen
yet we know what needs to be done for example to end the ebola disaster halt climate change rid our world of hunger and begin the difficult process of healing deep divisions in our societies
our failure is not because of a lack of knowledge or global resources but leadership and resolve by politicians but also throughout society
how we put this right must be at the heart of all discussions at davos this week
let's start with ebola
we have known about this disease for forty years how deadly it is how it is <unk> and how to prevent infection
yet we have lost thousands of lives already to the epidemic in west africa and only now have the resources from within countries and outside been mobilized to halt it
we need to learn the lessons and ensure we can move much more quickly and effectively before such deadly diseases take hold
the last few months have also <unk> the need for big <unk> to invest more into the research of diseases that occur in <unk> countries
the extraordinary progress in <unk> some of the world's greatest killers through the development and distribution of vaccines shows what can be achieved through our collective efforts
second africa with the world's most <unk> <unk> land has the potential to help end the global food security and <unk> crisis
yet it <unk> to grow enough food even to feed its own people
africa's governments have <unk> their responsibility to put in place the policies and <unk> which will enable the continent's farmers big and small to provide the food needed
they must deliver the improved infrastructure which is vital to this ambition
business must respond as well particularly by giving small holder farmers the access to new crop <unk> techniques and markets
the third area where leadership is absolutely crucial is the climate crisis
how is it possible that climate change <unk> <unk> fail to provide the breakthrough given that the science is so clear about the threat to future generations and our planet
in december a global agreement must be reached in paris on the framework and policies needed to halt climate change
political leaders need to look beyond the next <unk> cycle
civil society has largely already understood what needs to be done
i believe corporations will quickly respond to the challenge as many already have
there can be no <unk> example of where our common values must be <unk>
there are welcome signs that this is at last beginning to be understood
<unk> we know that successful peace processes are our only chance of escaping the circle of violence
without the resolve to address the past openly and without leaders showing the courage to give peace <unk> the independence they need solutions will be <unk>
it takes courage to address the rights of victims <unk> but it is fundamental to heal wounds permanently
in a world <unk> with conflict this courage will be more essential than ever
the international community needs to do more to support countries through this often difficult process
finally there is also an urgent need to step up support for democracy and elections
while almost every country now votes public faith in democracy is on the <unk>
in too many countries political leaders <unk> the process to deny their citizens a proper voice
even in <unk> <unk> there is an increasingly widespread belief that elections change little and that the political elite serve only their only narrow interests
leaders in two thousand and fifteen will once more have the choice between using elections to give their <unk> a <unk> of democratic legitimacy or ensuring a level playing field <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> and above all accept the result <unk>
last year's successful presidential elections and peaceful hand over of power in indonesia the world's third largest democracy even when the result was very close provided real hope for the future
supporting the integrity of elections in africa and elsewhere will be an area like all these challenges i and my foundation sees as particular priorities this year
in times of <unk> it is all too easy to surrender to fear and retreat look <unk> and think short term
but what is urgently needed is the ability in politics but also in business and society as a whole to look beyond national borders the next election or set of <unk> results
this must <unk> not just discussions at davos but all our actions as voters citizens and consumers in the coming months and years
read more of cnn's coverage from davos two thousand and fifteen
that seems to be the <unk> message of a twenty nine second video posted online this week by british journalist owen thomas <unk> the condition of the first class cabin on a british airways flight
<unk> a <unk> experience on a flight from london to saint <unk> on january seventeen thomas instead found a first class cabin he describes in the video as absolutely <unk> and <unk>
in the video thomas a <unk> tv <unk> who has previously worked for cnn international and the bbc points out <unk> <unk> then <unk> his seat <unk> to reveal dirt and dust collected underneath
it's when you open your seat that the real horror begins thomas says in dramatic fashion <unk> the video as he shoots it
this is british airways first class
it's <unk>
the video shows only thomas <unk> area and no other parts of the cabin
after the video went viral a ba spokesperson told london's telegraph
we are very sorry that on this occasion we have fallen short of our usual high standards
we pride ourselves on delivering a <unk> and <unk> experience in first class and are taking immediate action to address this issue

french company <unk> has created the <unk> a <unk> or wind tree a three meter tall <unk> designed for urban <unk> which makes the most of smaller air currents
operating in near complete silence the wind tree <unk> of seventy two <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> in the wind <unk> an estimated three point <unk> <unk> of power
while this isn't much compared to industrial sized turbines which typically generate in the region of one three <unk> having multiple smaller turbines has its uses
urban wind is not very strong but it is very turbulent says <unk> <unk> engineer <unk> <unk>
these turbines need less wind to get started and produce around three <unk> of energy which could heat a small home fuel lights or charge an electric car
<unk> was founded by <unk> <unk> <unk> three years ago when he had the idea for the wind tree while taking a walk
he saw the leaves on a tree moving in the wind and started thinking about the possibility of turning that <unk> energy into electricity
the current <unk> of the tree is steel and the energy made from it goes into the electricity <unk> and is used locally
we haven't yet <unk> the structure says <unk>
we are hoping to make the leaves out of <unk> friendly materials and for the tree to have as a low a carbon <unk> as possible
a twelve meter tall <unk> of the tree will be on display from march twelve for two months at place de la <unk> a major public square in paris
this <unk> which weighs around five tons and costs roughly thirty five thousand dollar is to be used as an educational tool and will aim to show the public the technology behind the structure
the wind tree will be mass produced for sale from march two thousand and fifteen and <unk> says it has raised one point one five million to begin pre production
the reaction has been very positive so far explains <unk>
people don't know how it works but they like it they find it magical
there is a very negative view of wind energy people think it's ugly and it ruins their landscapes
then they see the wind tree and they think differently
<unk> has had interest from local government in france and europe as well as real estate agents and businesses that want to have the tree on their land
there are even talks about another demonstration tree in london next year
the wind tree may not be affordable and practical for everyone but there are other applications that could be more accessible
our technology is in the mini wind turbines says <unk>
so we are developing other applications for them
architects have been in touch and are interested in using them in their work perhaps on the <unk> of buildings
mini turbines are cheaper to produce and buy than the wind tree
other ideas for the <unk> include rooftop <unk> installed on buildings <unk> on <unk> and the smart <unk> where the mini turbines are attached to <unk> <unk>
however innovative this is not the first urban energy source inspired by nature check out the power <unk> and others in the gallery above
it has become a cultural symbol of a deeply divided nation
along its <unk> path and elsewhere polish photojournalist <unk> mielnikiewicz met people whose lives have been <unk> changed since fighting erupted last year between ukrainian government forces and pro russia rebels
despite a <unk> ceasefire which was reached last september <unk> fighting continues
i'm trying to show the amazing <unk> spirit of people which are united and determined to fight for what they believe mielnikiewicz told cnn on the phone this week
her camera captured <unk> people linked to the conflict
a masked fighter brandishing a piece of wood shaped like a rifle children wearing <unk> uniforms standing at attention a young couple dramatically embracing in the midst of an intense protest
mielnikiewicz also photographed landscapes <unk> the mood of the region
a cable car suspended over the <unk> <unk> giant concrete wave <unk> blocking a road and a protest <unk> depicting russian president vladimir putin wearing a hitler style <unk>
the <unk> basically <unk> ukraine into two parts east and west as it <unk> roughly north to south connecting the capital kiev to the black sea
the farther east of the river you go residents tend to <unk> toward pro russia rebels
the farther west of the river people are more likely to support the government
i'm trying to keep a wider perspective mielnikiewicz said <unk> that although the fighting has been limited to relatively small regions it has very much affected people nationwide
before the ceasefire an august report from the united nations said at least two thousand two hundred and twenty people had been killed since mid april two thousand and fourteen
at least five thousand nine hundred and fifty six had been wounded the report said not including the two hundred and ninety eight victims of malaysian airlines flight seventeen which was shot down over the region in july
russia annexed ukraine's <unk> <unk> region of crimea in march supported by <unk> ethnic russian majority
putin said russia was protecting crimea
but international opponents called it a land grab and slapped russia with economic sanctions
photographing people in war torn countries wasn't what mielnikiewicz had in mind when she first <unk> her career
she said she started as a very <unk> engaged person in general who <unk> to become a <unk>
in a sense photography can combine those two things she said
you can be a <unk> engaged artist being a photographer
what interests me in photography is it can be a tool to be able to talk to people to <unk> their stories to tell their stories
she trained to become a film critic she said
but eventually mielnikiewicz knew she wanted to watch dramatic events <unk> in real life instead of on the silver screen
her ukraine photos won mielnikiewicz a grant from the u.s. based aftermath project which <unk> photographers to tell stories about the aftermath of conflict
she hopes <unk> be able to return to ukraine this year to reunite with the people she met and see how their lives have changed

i failed to protect you details emerge from stampede
investigators blamed various government agencies of the city's <unk> district whose <unk> includes the bund for the fatal incident
they said local officials were ill prepared for the crowds and <unk> the aftermath
although the district authorities had earlier called off a popular riverfront light show on new year's eve thousands of <unk> unaware of the <unk> due to the lack of official <unk> still <unk> to the bund investigators said
they singled out the district police department for severely <unk> the crowd size which had reached three hundred and ten thousand people by midnight and <unk> fewer than six hundred officers and other security personnel to the area

the plane ascended suddenly with a speed that was above the normal speed limit and then it went up transportation minister <unk> jonan told reporters after he briefed lawmakers at a parliamentary hearing
afterward it stalled
at one point the plane was climbing at a speed of six thousand feet per minute jonan said
a fighter jet like the f a eighteen super <unk> can climb as fast as thirty thousand feet per minute
but commercial jets are designed to <unk> at a much slower rate
the latest data show the airasia plane an airbus a three hundred and twenty was climbing at a rate twice as fast as it could and should do on its own cnn aviation analyst mary schiavo said
i think that means there was a tremendous amount of winds and weather she said
the commercial jet lost contact with air traffic controllers on december twenty eight as it flew from the indonesian city of surabaya toward singapore with one hundred and sixty two people on board
amid increasingly bad weather one of the pilots had requested to <unk> from the plane's planned route airasia has said
and experts have <unk> since day one that storms might have played a role in the plane crash
if the plane was climbing at six thousand feet per minute schiavo said numerous <unk> would have sounded in the cockpit
but if the aircraft got caught in an <unk> she said the pilots might not have been aware at first of why it was climbing so quickly when they weren't <unk> that into the controls
picture your <unk> showing your car <unk> when your foot isn't pressing on the gas <unk>
the pilots would have had control of the plane she said but may not have even realized what was occurring because of the confusing <unk> from the aircraft
last week searchers recovered the plane's flight data and voice data recorders which investigators hope will help them determine what happened aboard the <unk> flight
indonesian investigators say audio <unk> from the plane's cockpit contain no sounds of gunfire or explosions making it unlikely the plane was brought down by terrorism
while transportation officials focus on <unk> out what happened search teams are still looking for most of the bodies of the people who were on board the plane
more than three weeks after the crash the remains of fifty three people have been recovered some of them still strapped into seats
many of the rest could be in the wreckage of the fuselage which searchers located last week at the bottom of the sea
efforts to examine and get inside the wreckage have been hindered by high waves and strong currents
the black clad isis militant shown in a video demanding a two hundred million dollar ransom to spare the lives of two japanese citizens looks and sounds similar to the man who has appeared in at least five previous hostage videos
the knife wielding masked man with a london <unk> <unk> jihadi john has issued threats and <unk> the beheadings of american and british captives
you now have seventy two hours to pressure your government in making a wise decision by paying the two hundred million dollar to save the lives of your citizens the man in the video that appeared tuesday says in comments addressed to japanese citizens
otherwise this knife will become your nightmare
the amount of money is the same as that recently pledged by japanese prime minister shinzo abe in humanitarian aid to middle east countries that are affected by isis bloody campaign in iraq and syria
japan believes the deadline <unk> friday at twelve fifty a.m
et
and chief cabinet minister <unk> suga said wednesday the country will do its best to communicate with isis through a third party nation
but mystery and confusion still surround the identity of jihadi john
u.s. and british officials have said they believe they know who he is but they haven't disclosed the information publicly
that could be because western intelligence agencies believe they have more to gain from keeping quiet says <unk> <unk> a former cia officer
they can put pressure on his family put pressure on his friends he told cnn
maybe they have a line to him
maybe they know who his <unk> are who are going to syria who can identify him
however if you publicly tell everybody who he is his real identity then maybe he'll go to ground and he'll disappear
there had been reports that jihadi john was injured in a bombing attack by the u.s. led anti isis coalition
but the video that appeared tuesday would suggest if it's really the same person that he's alive and well enough to make a death threat accompanied by a demand for money
his apparent <unk> helps isis slick propaganda machine which is used by the extremist group to raise money and recruit followers
it shows them resilient that they're able to film this video with these japanese hostages outside in broad <unk> somewhere <unk> in syria said cnn terrorism analyst paul cruickshank
five months and roughly two thousand airstrikes after isis video of the killing of u.s. journalist james foley why does one of the <unk> most prominent <unk> appear to still be at liberty
u.s. and british military and intelligence officials declined to comment on the matter
experts say the problem lies in the extreme difficulty of <unk> commandos into syria to reach jihadi john
isis operates in what we call denied territory said <unk> <unk> a retired u.s. air force <unk>
and that means by definition that it's very hard for our <unk> to get in there it's very hard for them to actually lay eyes on target
a mission by u.s. special operations forces in july failed to find foley and other hostages in syria
the attempt to rescue mr. foley is one of the things that has now made the white house very <unk> to act <unk> said tony <unk> a former u.s. intelligence operative who directed special operations in iraq and afghanistan
a senior u.s. administration official however said the u.s. government is actively pursuing justice for the slayings of the hostages
the fbi has an open criminal investigation and as you have seen we will hold terrorists like this accountable no matter how long it takes the official said on condition of anonymity
for operational security reasons we are not in a position to detail all of the steps we are <unk>
meanwhile as isis deadline draws <unk> the japanese government has to decide how it will respond to the extremists latest life or death ultimatum

just three hundred infections of the <unk> tapeworm were recorded between one thousand nine hundred and fifty three and two thousand and thirteen but they're thought to be more common in parts of asia

these <unk> are pretty mysterious says <unk> <unk> <unk> from the <unk> trust <unk> institute in cambridge whose team recently <unk> the <unk> of the rare worm
we know it has a very complicated life cycle

the resulting <unk> form of tapeworm known as <unk> can then stay in the water within certain small <unk> or end up in <unk> and <unk>

the worm then took hold
the <unk> can <unk> in the brain or somewhere else says <unk>
the consequences of these <unk> can be tissue damage <unk> <unk> or even death
by <unk> the worm's <unk> <unk> hoped to understand the inner <unk> of the <unk> to aid future diagnosis and treatment
because it's such a rare infection it's not economically viable to create a drug just for this worm she explains
but by <unk> it to other <unk> we can see which other drugs might apply
the team were given small samples of the worm <unk> from the infected patient and their <unk> identified an <unk> large <unk> and <unk> <unk> which could help recognize resistance to drugs as well as act as future drug targets
you could also develop a <unk> test adds <unk>
there are many forms of tapeworm three of which can <unk> <unk> the brain
from a public health perspective there's one in particular to watch out for
it's mainly the pork tapeworm that's the main brain one says <unk> <unk> from the london school of hygiene and tropical medicine
the pork species known as <unk> <unk> can <unk> humans in two forms
the first is by eating <unk> pork from infected pigs resulting in <unk> an adult worm <unk> in the <unk>
the second in the <unk> form through contact with the <unk> of an infected pig or human which can go on to <unk> many <unk>
if the <unk> worm <unk> the nervous system including the brain it can result in a condition known as <unk>
infection of this kind can often cause <unk> once inside the brain

self infection is common
the global distribution of pork <unk> is widespread with high numbers across latin america africa and asia according to the world health organization

food import and export is increasing and increasing risks of <unk> infected goods says <unk> who feels there is a need for more <unk> with food inspection
she <unk> more cases will occur in places like the united kingdom where such infections have been virtually <unk>
i'm confident there will be more of this in the future agrees gkrania klotsas who has seen patients infected without having traveled abroad
people are getting infections without going anywhere
those who do travel however also need greater awareness when visiting regions where infections are <unk>

prosecutor <unk> nisman was found dead in his apartment just one day before he was supposed to testify before lawmakers about allegations that the country's most powerful officials <unk> to cover up iran's involvement in the one thousand nine hundred and ninety four bombing
government officials called it a suicide but theories of something more <unk> <unk> immediately
protesters took to the streets monday night near the presidential palace the <unk> <unk> waving argentine flags and holding signs <unk> <unk> <unk> nisman or i am nisman
in a report nisman filed last week he alleged that argentine president <unk> fernandez de <unk> and foreign minister <unk> timerman among others covered up iran's involvement in the bombing of a jewish community center more than twenty years ago that left eighty five people dead
the fernandez government pushed the suicide theory pointing to the evidence
nisman was found dead from a gunshot wound to his temple in his apartment bathroom a twenty two <unk> gun and a shell <unk> near his body
but a test for gunpowder <unk> on nisman's hands came back negative said <unk> <unk> the federal prosecutor leading the investigation into his death
<unk> said the result does not rule out the possibility that nisman shot himself it only shows that no gunpowder <unk> was found as would be expected if he pulled the <unk>
<unk> had said earlier that the medical <unk> concluded that there was no third party involved in nisman's death
an investigation into the suicide claim has to include a look at whether such an act was provoked or <unk> by some other person she said
for protesters in buenos aires plaza de <unk> the prosecutor's death struck a deeper <unk>
the killing of nisman will <unk> the argentine people to put an end to the corruption to end this state of disaster that we live in here in argentina one protester said
one woman compared the country's politicians to the <unk> and another said that argentine democracy was not a democracy anymore
the investigation into the deadliest bombing in argentina's history led nisman down a trail that he seemingly understood to be dangerous
after <unk> the complaint last week against the president foreign minister and other officials he made a <unk> comment about the investigation
i could end up dead from this nisman told a reporter
twice
his <unk> came true the next day
diego <unk> a former argentine ambassador to the united states told cnn en <unk> that the suicide explanation is ridiculous
nisman was committed to his investigation which he had been <unk> since two thousand and four <unk> said
the prosecutor voluntarily wanted to testify before congress about what he considered <unk> evidence of a governmental cover up regarding the one thousand nine hundred and ninety four bombing <unk> said
without a doubt this is an incident that has shocked all <unk> very strongly he said
the fernandez administration hit back sharply after nisman's complaint was filed last week denying that there was a cover up about iranian links to the bombing of the argentine <unk> mutual association building
prosecutors in argentina have alleged for years that iran was behind the attack but a criminal investigation has stalled in part because iran <unk> the charges and has not made the accused available to prosecutors
argentina requested the arrest of several iranians in two thousand and seven in connection with the bombing including the current defense minister of iran ahmad <unk>
interpol approved so called red notices for these suspects <unk> countries around the world of buenos aires desire to have them arrested
to <unk> this <unk> fernandez signed an agreement with iran to create a joint commission to investigate the bombing
she said it would move the investigation along while critics said such a probe would only protect the iranian suspects
in his report nisman alleged that fernandez and timerman wanted to cover up iran's involvement in order to boost trade specifically oil imports and grain exports with the islamic republic
suicide <unk> in all cases first
<unk> and then
questions
what was it that led a person to make the terrible decision to take his own life
fernandez wrote in a lengthy letter she posted on her facebook page
she hailed her own involvement in the investigation into the bombing dating back to her time as a lawmaker in the early two thousand s. as the investigation <unk> politically motivated conspiracy theories and allegations <unk> she said
as time goes on instead of <unk> everything becomes more <unk> fernandez wrote
it became complicated and there was a growing <unk> at least for me of being in a theater of national and international politics in which the victims were important to very few and the truth even more so
nisman's allegations of a cover up she said were intended to lie <unk> and <unk>
in the wake of nisman's death a judge has ordered that all of the the evidence collected by the prosecutor be preserved said patricia <unk> an argentine lawmaker and head of the committee that invited nisman to testify
nisman's role was to investigate the bombing in which eight iranians had been charged <unk> told cnn en <unk>
in the course of that investigation nisman came upon evidence that led to his claims of a cover up the lawmaker said
after nisman filed his complaint with the new allegations last week it was <unk> who invited him to speak before congress
he was found dead just hours before he was supposed to testify
in the days before his death on sunday the prosecutor was very active very focused on the <unk> he was going to give before congress in the evidence he was going to present and his mind made up about going forward with it <unk> said
it's hard to believe that he would have taken his own life
in a video posted tuesday to social media a black clad isis militant stood over two men he said were japanese citizens
both would die he said unless the japanese government paid the islamist extremist group two hundred million dollar within seventy two hours
that isis wants ransom isn't unexpected
but a few things like the public nature and staggering amount of the request make it stand out
yes
it's hard to <unk> all the examples because hostage takers in ambitious militant groups like isis rarely make their demands public
but just as kidnappings are the <unk> for such groups so is asking for ransom
one documented example is the case of james foley an american journalist abducted in northern syria in november two thousand and twelve
isis would later demand one hundred million euros for his release said richard <unk> a spokesman for the news website <unk> that foley <unk> for before
neither <unk> nor <unk> family nor the u.s. government paid that amount
even if they had there's no telling if isis would have kept its word and freed foley
instead the group not only beheaded foley but recorded his killing and put it online for the world to see
one thing that makes the latest ransom request unique is that isis made it publicly and set a three day deadline for it to be met
this suggests as much <unk> as fundraising especially when coupled with its <unk> japan for supporting governments involved in the anti isis fight
isis rationale seems similar to other terror groups
kidnappings help raise money and if ransoms aren't paid make a point such as the groups are not to be <unk> with and even civilians are in danger
<unk> the public relations strategy of a group like isis can be a challenge
but there's no doubt the group uses modern technology to get the word out on its captives including when they are beheaded
such pictures further the image of isis as a ruthless defiant organization dedicated to <unk> out anyone soldiers or civilians who doesn't follow its extreme conservative version of sharia law
the money making aspect is more under the radar but still significant
the u.s. <unk> department estimated in two thousand and twelve that al qaeda and its affiliates <unk> one hundred and twenty million dollar from ransoms over the previous eight years
and a new york times <unk> piece from july two thousand and fourteen determined that al qaeda and its affiliates took in one hundred and twenty five million dollar since two thousand and eight including sixty six million dollar in two thousand and thirteen alone
there hasn't been a similarly detailed review for isis but that doesn't mean ransoms in addition to things like oil revenues criminal <unk> as well as taxes tolls and other fees imposed on those in its territories aren't a significant part of the group's budget
countries don't <unk> how much they pay in ransom
doing so could invite kidnappers to seize their citizens for ransom
but that doesn't mean some countries don't do it
the summer two thousand and fourteen new york times article citing french media reports identified france as the country that pays out the most to al qaeda affiliates
france's reported fifty eight million dollar figure since two thousand and eight is far higher than the next highest total twenty million dollar as paid out from oman and qatar
the times reports that switzerland paid out twelve million dollar spain eleven million dollar and <unk> three million dollar in the same time frame
it's not just al qaeda that france has dealt with
four french journalists taken captive by isis were released last april
a group's ransom request could depend on a lot of factors
a high profile hostage for instance could demand a higher price
and a <unk> <unk> may ask less than one belonging to a large powerful defiant group especially one like isis that's proved its willingness to kill civilians
the amount of ransom requested and paid apparently has gone up
a decade ago the times reported that a standard asking price might be two hundred thousand dollar
nowadays it's more likely to be in the millions
phil <unk> <unk> ceo told cnn that european governments have paid between two million dollar and four million dollar for hostages
but it is not two hundred million dollar as was requested for the two japanese hostages
nor is it the one hundred and thirty two million dollar requested for foley
both figures from isis are <unk> high and seem to suggest the group is as interested in making a point as it is in making money given the <unk> it will be paid
on tuesday japanese prime minister shinzo abe did not rule out paying a ransom or negotiating with his two citizens captors
does that mean tokyo is willing to pay or at least talk
not necessarily
japan hasn't said it has paid ransoms before and there's no reason to think the country would in this case
japan signed a two thousand and thirteen g eight <unk> that stated we unequivocally reject the payment of ransoms to terrorists and we call on countries and companies around the world to follow our lead to <unk> this out
this policy <unk> those of the united kingdom and the united states with <unk> mother <unk> telling cnn that a u.s. official once threatened her with prosecution if she tried to raise ransom on her own
why wouldn't countries like these two and japan tap into their relatively vast resources to save the lives of their citizens
for one thing groups like isis and al qaeda may not be the most <unk> so paying up won't necessarily guarantee a release
and it might end up putting others at risk both by encouraging more kidnappings and funding those behind mass killings
as under secretary for terrorism and financial intelligence david s. <unk> argued in two thousand and twelve ransom payments lead to future kidnappings and future kidnappings lead to additional ransom payments
and it all <unk> the capacity of terrorist organizations to conduct attacks
some say that countries with no ransom policies can end up giving militant groups <unk> to kidnap more people if they negotiate with them
this debate raged after the <unk> release of u.s. army sgt
<unk> <unk> last year in exchange for five taliban figures then in u.s. military custody at guantanamo bay cuba
president barack obama said afterward i make absolutely no apologies for making sure we get a young man back to his parents
in japan's case such a prisoner swap isn't an option
it's not as if the country has a lot of suspected isis members in its custody
so <unk> <unk> <unk> might <unk> more of doing something like not giving two hundred million dollar to those invested in the anti isis fight a pledge that abe said tuesday he's not willing to <unk>
isis history shows there may not be a lot but it's possible that there will be talks with the isis hostage takers
japan can point to the fact that unlike the united states and britain it's not involved directly with the military effort in iraq or syria
isis might surprise everyone by <unk> the japanese pair as a goodwill gesture
but <unk> a last <unk> diplomatic effort japan may have to rely on military forces from allies in the west the middle east or elsewhere to rescue its citizens
whatever the approach time is clearly running out
a day earlier ukrainian prime minister <unk> yatsenyuk said russian troops had crossed the border to support pro russian rebels
ukraine and the west for months have accused russia of supporting rebels in eastern ukraine by sending in russian troops weapons and supplies

our latest estimate today is that india has seventy percents of the world's tiger population and we have now two thousand two hundred and twenty six tigers <unk> in forty seven tiger reserves up from one thousand seven hundred and six in two thousand and eleven and this is a great achievement
it is a net increase of thirty percents over the last <unk> environment minister <unk> <unk> said in a statement monday

<unk> banks head of the tiger campaign at the environmental investigation agency which carries out extensive research on the illegal tiger trade welcomed news of the study saying she looked forward to seeing the full report when it releases in march
i think it has set india apart from some of the other tiger range countries
if you look at china <unk> cambodia vietnam thailand there's more <unk> on tigers in captivity farming and <unk> tigers for their body parts higher than the survival of tigers in the wild she says to cnn
india's once thriving tiger population has been severely affected by poaching a reduction in <unk> habitat destruction and conflict with villagers who may occupy the same area
although preliminary results of the government's study are promising banks warns against <unk>
while this is good news from india i don't think anyone is sitting back and saying we've won
the demand within china for <unk> to <unk> homes and bones for tiger <unk> wine all continue
and so it's a constant battle
a major challenge is also the sophistication of the tiger trade where body parts of the animal are transported across <unk> borders such as mountain passes
the criminals have changed their practice
and there's no evidence of any enforcement there she says
a historical symbol of power and beauty in cultures such as india and china the significance of the tiger goes beyond its <unk> banks says
tigers are major <unk> of the health of the environment certainly the health of the forest that they <unk>
but they are the water gods if you like
they are <unk> of how well we are doing to <unk> forests that provide water for millions of people and mitigate climate change
there's an ecosystem reason to save wild tigers
and if today's results are anything to go by banks says india appears to be leading that charge
india despite all the problems it has with high human population in small areas is totally setting the <unk> for wild tiger conservation
so far there has been no decision to evacuate the embassy
the uss <unk> <unk> and the uss fort <unk> were moved because they will be in the best position if asked by the state department to evacuate the embassy a u.s. official with direct knowledge of the planning tells cnn
so far there has been decision to evacuate the embassy and no request from the state department for military assistance
if an evacuation is ordered the first option would be to have embassy personnel drive to the commercial airport in sanaa and fly out the official said
but in the wake of an embassy car being fired tuesday the safety of the roads in the capital is now being constantly <unk> the official said
if embassy workers did drive to the airport it is likely some sort of air cover would be provided under the current plan
other detailed military planning for various options has been <unk> the official said
those options would be used if a request for military assistance were made
if helicopters and <unk> twenty two aircraft from the ships are sent to sanaa it would be a complex operation that could last for several days to fully evacuate several hundred americans from the embassy the official cautioned
nobody should think this would be easy
the military is aware the state department wants to keep the embassy open as long as possible the official said noting that it's a valuable tool to monitor al qaeda in yemen
but behind the scenes the pentagon is pressing the point that if an evacuation becomes necessary they want to do it before the chaos in sanaa <unk> into a non <unk> environment <unk> to combat
for now the us believes the houthis are not targeting americans but its not clear if that will last
the plan at this point only involves the potential evacuation of state department personnel
it would be up to state to decide if it wants to extend the potential mission to other americans in yemen

the same would be true for parts of america where you might feel uncomfortable walking around if you were say black or white it would depend on the neighborhood
it's not unusual for <unk> economic even <unk> or ethnic groups to cluster
my own grandparents came to the united states as immigrants in one thousand nine hundred and twelve and they lived for some years in italian <unk> in new york
most immigrant groups start in <unk> somewhere and many of them never get out
but the question of sharia law is interesting
<unk> sharia courts will be found in europe here and there
but these <unk> bodies don't <unk> the legal system of the country where they occur
an article in the economist noted in fact that there have long been <unk> courts in jewish neighborhoods in britain not a <unk> sort of thing
there are even places in the united states where christians can work out their <unk> in a kind of <unk> manner
family law for instance is often the issue here and there are cultural values that play into the need for this kind of <unk> <unk> <unk>
that in some muslim neighborhoods there might be an accommodation to sharia law seems not surprising and this doesn't mean that sooner or later we can expect <unk> women to be <unk> to death in birmingham or <unk> to have their hands <unk> off in east london
blasphemy will not soon lead to the gas chamber in europe indeed capital punishment is not legal in any european country
getting back to gov
jindal one has to wonder what prompted his ignorant <unk>
was this a lame attempt to play into the broad public fears of radical islam that have <unk> in the wake of the charlie hebdo killings
if so that's not good enough for a politician with any <unk> of integrity
in my view jindal immediately <unk> himself from ever holding a national political office by making such a bizarre statement though it hasn't stopped any number of american politicians with bizarre <unk> from winning major national offices in the past
such behavior does however <unk> this country in the court of world opinion
the british and most european countries have struggled to accommodate muslim immigrants but they have nevertheless welcomed them in large numbers
for the most part these immigrants have <unk> well despite the fear of their traditions and beliefs that leads to crazy <unk> by politicians such as jindal
there have been isolated and gruesome incidents of terrorism the murder of a british soldier lee <unk> in the spring of two thousand and thirteen comes to mind or the vicious attacks in london of july seven two thousand and five which left fifty two dead and over seven hundred injured
the british have had to confront terror and they've done so without <unk> large parts of their own population
indeed they've been forced to come to terms with what i would call british <unk> the old <unk> feeling that nobody who is not british can possibly lead a civilized way of life
jindal was apparently on a ten day fact finding mission designed to bolster his <unk> for a possible run at the white house in two thousand and sixteen
he's not as <unk> as he sounds in fact
let's hope that he is a quick study and that he <unk> how not to say <unk> things in public that cause a good deal of offense if not harm to <unk> people <unk> hatred rather than coming to terms
yemen's president resigned shortly after his prime minister and the cabinet stepped down <unk> changes in the country's political scene a day after the government and houthi rebels had struck a tentative peace deal meant to end turmoil
but on tuesday the situation in yemen apparently became much more dire as the country's minister of information said shiite houthi rebels had taken over the nation's presidential palace
amid reports of renewed fighting in yemen <unk> sakkaf told cnn that the residence of yemen's prime minister was under attack
sakkaf called the situation the <unk> of a coup adding that president abdu rabu mansour hadi has no control
yemen the poorest country in the region is home to al qaeda in the arabian peninsula or aqap which most recently claimed responsibility for the massacre of journalists at the french satirical magazine charlie hebdo in paris
it's one of the world's biggest <unk> of terrorism
aqap is benefiting hugely from the current conflict in yemen
gunfire could be heard throughout the capital sanaa on tuesday as cnn's nick paton walsh reported that security there was <unk>
on monday night unknown assailants fired shots at a u.s. embassy vehicle in the city the embassy said
it has said it's prepared to evacuate but no orders have been given
here are seven things you need to know about what's happening in yemen and why it matters
yemen is a country of about twenty six million people on the southwestern tip of the arabian peninsula
it borders saudi arabia and oman and is near important red sea shipping <unk>
yemen is a young nation having been created in one thousand nine hundred and ninety when north and south yemen united
the north and south started a civil war within a few years with the north <unk> after thousands died
yemen is very poor because of <unk> oil resources
because terrorists in yemen have reached into the united states
remember umar farouk abdulmutallab the underwear bomber who tried to blow up an american <unk> over detroit in two thousand and nine
he took his marching orders from aqap
the boston marathon bombing suspects and maj. <unk> <unk> the american soldier who gunned down thirteen people at fort <unk> texas apparently were inspired by an american born cleric in yemen anwar al awlaki
an american drone killed him in two thousand and eleven
many would be jihadis from the west are recruited into al qaeda through a slick english language online magazine inspire that's run out of yemen
u.s. officials consider aqap the most dangerous branch of al qaeda according to cnn terrorism analyst paul cruickshank
it's actually a three way battle among the government the houthis and aqap
the houthis a rebel group <unk> of shiite muslims feel marginalized in the majority sunni country
in september houthis seized government buildings in sanaa and its airport
they demanded greater political influence
president hadi introduced a new constitution without the houthis approval and the rebels abducted yemen's presidential chief of staff to show their <unk>
in response the government closed roads as a security measure
that set off renewed fighting
most of the recent fighting has been for control of the presidential complex
on monday the government and the houthis announced another ceasefire
hadi has battled aqap since taking office in two thousand and twelve and the united states has invested heavily in this campaign
he <unk> yemen's military and for a while put aqap on the <unk>
but the conflict with the houthis diverted resources that could be used against aqap
aqap is working to keep things <unk> but it doesn't look like the group has been involved in the sanaa fighting so far
in october aqap <unk> a suicide bombing against a houthi rally that killed fifty people
it also released a video showing members executing fourteen houthis
at the same time it has stepped up attacks against police and the army
no way
in fact they're <unk> in the long running sunni shiite conflict
differences between the two main <unk> of islam developed over the centuries
shiite muslims believed the prophet <unk> cousin should have been the successor after his death in in <unk> six hundred and thirty two while <unk> believe a successor should have been elected
only ten percents of the world's muslim population is shiite
they're named after the late cleric hussein <unk> al <unk> who was killed during a two thousand and four rebellion against the government in saada according to the u.s. state department
houthis are mostly militias and tribes that follow the <unk> <unk> of islam
al qaeda considers them <unk>
some members of al qaeda and even western diplomats allege that iran one of the few shiite muslim nations is <unk> the houthi rebellion in an effort to control yemen's red sea coast on one of the world's busiest shipping <unk>
the houthis deny iran is funding them
hadi has said the houthis are being trained and advised by hezbollah the lebanese shiite militia
some presidential officials are worried about actions by republican guards former regime officials who are still loyal to ali abdullah saleh the ex president who was kicked out in two thousand and twelve during the arab spring
the weaker the government the easier it will be for al qaeda to bring in people and train them for terrorism
the chaos <unk> western efforts to hunt down al qaeda and <unk> western efforts to even be in the country
while there have also been largely peaceful protests authorities from africa to the middle east are seeing clashes in the streets and seeking ways to <unk> down the <unk> among muslims <unk> over depictions of the prophet mohammed

the two gunmen killed in one of the raids in the city of verviers are <unk> of north african descent from the same brussels district
they were in phone contact with an isis ringleader in greece who belgian authorities believe was probably abaaoud

that thirty three year old suspect was wanted in belgium on charges of terrorist activity greek police said monday
belgium is <unk> an extradition

coulibaly killed four hostages on january nine at a kosher grocery store in paris before police killed him

before the siege he had proclaimed his allegiance to the islamic state in iraq and syria or isis
new surveillance video obtained by cnn shows coulibaly and his partner hayat boumedienne outside a jewish institution in paris
the video was recorded at the end of august or beginning of september and stored on a security camera

one post that appeared on the <unk> twitter account said je <unk> suis <unk> charlie and <unk> attacks on syria
after the hacking of our account our teams have taken it back into our hands the <unk> account said in another tweet about an hour later
we apologize for any <unk> posts on our behalf
a soft spoken and shy man shin shared his <unk> story about escaping from a total control zone called camp fourteen giving western <unk> an accessible reading on north korea
over the weekend shin stated that parts of his stories are <unk> although he did not specify which aspects
he posted on facebook that parts of his past that i so badly wanted to cover up can no longer be hidden
<unk> <unk> author of escape from camp fourteen wrote on his website that shin had admitted several <unk> including the length of time he spent in camp fourteen
shin's high profile role and now admitted <unk> in his story raised concerns that it could undermine human rights advocacy efforts and <unk> from <unk> by other north korean refugees
there are a lot of people who actually have been to the camp and experienced it
it will be wrong for their witness accounts to lose credibility because of this incident said <unk> <unk> <unk> a former north korean camp guard who knows shin
peter <unk> director of the human rights group justice for north korea said he's worried that people <unk> about north korea will be called a <unk> but that shin's new revelations can't challenge the fact that north korea control camps exist
<unk> said that many north korean refugees such as shin suffer from major trauma after escaping the regime and called for support
i hope he <unk> his courage and tells his story <unk> and <unk> and we must help him do that
north korean <unk> and <unk> can not be verified there are no paper <unk> and investigators can not interview or access witnesses in a closed society
their stories are compared for <unk> with other <unk> and experts but the process is far from <unk>
cnn has not been able to reach shin who noted in his social media apology that these will be my final words and this will likely be my final post
shin's admission of <unk> comes at a time of <unk> attention on north korea's human rights record following a landmark u.n. commission of inquiry report <unk> abuses of the pyongyang regime
while escape from camp fourteen was not the <unk> reason for the creation of the commission <unk> <unk> then the u.n. high commissioner for human rights urged the probe after meeting shin and another north korean prison camp survivor in december two thousand and twelve
since the commission report's release in two thousand and fourteen the u.n. general assembly has called for more sanctions and a <unk> of those responsible to the international criminal court
the matter remains at the u.n. security council where it's likely china would block <unk> of kim jong un and his leadership to the international criminal court
michael kirby chairman of the commission of inquiry into north korea said that shin's testimony <unk> of only two <unk> in the four hundred page report and that he was only one of hundreds of north korean witnesses
it's a very small part of a very long story
and it really doesn't affect the credibility of the testimony which is online he said
lots of people took part this inquiry
their stories are powerful and <unk> and these stories do not only represent shin but other people in north korea
in a <unk> of his story told for years shin told <unk> on friday that he had been transferred to another prison camp eighteen when he was six instead of spending his entire life inside north korea at the total control zone camp fourteen the author says on his website
the <unk> of whether shin was imprisoned in camp fourteen or eighteen was not a deal <unk> for kirby
it seems as if the issue is whether he was in the total control zone or whether he was in an ordinary prison camp
in another words it's whether <unk> horror or double horror kirby said
shin <unk> the physical <unk> of torture including a missing <unk> and burn marks on his back according to the book
and <unk> noted in his book that during the interview process shin at times was <unk> and in many crucial instances <unk> his korean <unk> an <unk> that shin wrote in two thousand and seven called escape to the outside world which was only published in korean
north korea had sought to <unk> shin
last fall a pro north korea government website released videos with english <unk> featuring a man whom shin recognized to be his father <unk> the story that his son was ever in a prison camp
shin responded with a statement accusing the government of holding my father hostage
it's unclear if the video had any bearing on the timing of shin's admission
<unk> the former prison camp guard who has known shin for seven years said he believes the <unk> of shin's story is true and that torture in either camp is still the same
shin became an icon for north korean human rights
whether he was in camp fourteen or camp eighteen he is definitely a person from a political prison camp
he was born there and <unk> there
swiss pilots <unk> piccard and <unk> <unk> announced the solar impulse two aircraft will <unk> the united arab emirates on their historic <unk> in late february or early march making a total of twelve planned stops
the route includes <unk> in myanmar
china
india
<unk> arizona
and new york's john f. kennedy international airport
at <unk> between fifty and one hundred kilometers per hour piccard and <unk> aim to circle the globe flying about twenty five days over a total of about five months
an earlier version of the plane was the first solar powered aircraft of <unk> <unk> to fly day and night without a drop of fuel according to its website thanks to advanced solar cells that charge light weight lithium batteries
the batteries are able to store enough energy to allow the plane to fly long <unk> at night
<unk> say solar impulse two takes what engineers learned from its predecessor and <unk> it a step further
<unk> the aircraft's <unk> to a giant boeing seven hundred and forty seven eight
solar impulse two is twelve feet wider at two hundred and thirty six feet
and it's very <unk> just two tons <unk> than a large <unk>
with just one seat designers <unk> solar impulse two isn't <unk> practical
but that's not the point
instead engineers aim to demonstrate the <unk> of solar powered aviation and to promote clean energy technology
soon the plane's unique <unk> may be visible across the <unk> of southern europe africa asia and north america
cities on the planned route include the chinese communities of <unk> and <unk> as well as <unk> and <unk> in india
the pilots have already set a few solar aviation records
in two thousand and ten with <unk> in the cockpit a previous solar impulse became the first manned plane to fly for twenty four hours on nothing but solar powered batteries
the team followed that up in two thousand and twelve when the plane flew from spain to morocco making it the first manned sun powered plane to fly to another continent
and in two thousand and thirteen piccard and <unk> flew an earlier version of solar impulse on a mission across the united states
piccard is a <unk> <unk> <unk> with world records to prove it
decades after <unk> <unk> aircraft in the one thousand nine hundred and seventy s piccard and his colleague brian jones were the first to circle the earth <unk> in a <unk> in one thousand nine hundred and ninety nine
their <unk> is displayed at the <unk>
breaking <unk> is a piccard family tradition
his grandfather explored the <unk> in a <unk> chamber carried by a <unk>
ten miles high he was the first human to see the <unk> of the planet with his own eyes
<unk> father <unk> the pacific taking a special <unk> to a record setting depth of nearly seven miles
<unk> came to the project with more than two decades as a swiss air force fighter pilot
it's a <unk> morning at <unk> financial district in the chinese city of <unk>
the government spent billions of dollars on this virtual <unk> of manhattan
take a look and see what's missing
the people
every week inside africa takes its viewers on a journey across africa exploring the true diversity and depth of different cultures countries and regions
whether they draw from their colonial past independence or the turbulent years of civil war that followed many <unk> have taken to the <unk> to express themselves
it's no wonder the <unk> art scene is taking the world by storm
for <unk> <unk> the sixteen year civil war that ended in one thousand nine hundred and ninety two provided not only the <unk> but the materials for his works
his sculptures intricate masks <unk> and <unk> are <unk> from recovered <unk> and military equipment <unk> old <unk> ak forty seven s and rocket <unk>
<unk> work was made possible through the efforts of the christian council of mozambique a group of local churches that launched the <unk> guns into <unk> program which offers participants tools and building materials in exchange for recovered weapons
the war is over
why do we still need weapons
let's destroy
and i'm glad the government at the time said yes let's destroy
for other artists like <unk> <unk> <unk> whose half mile <unk> are dotted throughout the landscape of <unk> the country's capital independence was the <unk> <unk> that got him painting
in one thousand nine hundred and seventy five when mozambique became its own country following a decade long <unk> against <unk> the land was covered in debris and was very much a blank <unk>
for <unk> <unk> proved the perfect medium to <unk> the public
at the time it was necessary to teach the people what's going on
what is independence
what is mozambique
it was necessary to teach people and people didn't read so we taught through paintings in the road he says referring to the low <unk> rate back then
like <unk> <unk> work has achieved international <unk> following an exhibit at the united nation's headquarters in one thousand nine hundred and ninety six
since he's been shown in countries throughout the world
it is a narrative that is becoming popular in the country which has started to gain a reputation as an <unk> of fine arts
there is an artistic movement <unk> <unk> <unk> president of <unk> <unk> di <unk> a <unk> exhibition space that <unk> many of the country's up and coming artists
a small group of german tourists is trapped inside
the bargain <unk> apartment they've been <unk> maybe doesn't seem like such a good deal now
there's no word of when a maintenance engineer will show up or even if such a person exists
this is clearly no <unk> <unk> tower
and that's just the way cuban author <unk> juan gutierrez likes it
up here i'm like a ghost
i've been a <unk> witness to what has gone on in the neighborhood he told me on a recent visit to his home
gutierrez has been living on the top floor for more than thirty years now
he's transformed a small roof <unk> into his own observation platform to peer down on what he calls central havana's dirty reality
these days gutierrez says he's turned to buddhism to beat his <unk> to cheap rum and wild sex
up in his ninth floor <unk> he's just about out of <unk> way
but one <unk> and he may just fall he says maybe he'll join me for a small drink down at ground level in the next few days
gutierrez has rarely been so clean living
he says he's spent most of the last three decades <unk> the streets and <unk> below
things are <unk> happening down there
<unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> he explained wide eyed
<unk> almost twenty works of <unk> and <unk> are <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
the <unk> <unk> critics have dubbed him the <unk> of dirty <unk>
his worst critics have condemned him as a crude <unk> for example before you even finish the first page of his <unk> dirty <unk> of havana there are graphic sexual scenes
some people accuse me of <unk> but i say no
the reality is excessive
i have to tone things down to make it <unk>
it's a very brutal violent reality and in order to make it credible you have to tone it down a bit he says
but i am interested in <unk> the ethics and the <unk> of the dirty ones the poorest people who live right on the edge he adds
his <unk> works are <unk> on the one thousand nine hundred and ninety s during cuba's so called special period
that was just after the soviet union collapsed leaving its caribbean ally cuba to economic <unk> and ruin <unk> of <unk> or a market for its goods
but gutierrez says not a lot has improved since then at least in central and old havana
everything has stayed the same here
the same poverty the same <unk> the same people who are just survivors he said
i write about people surviving on the limits
<unk> his finger into the afternoon sun gutierrez points out <unk> <unk> <unk> and san <unk> the four streets that he says once formed cuba's largest red light district before the one thousand nine hundred and fifty nine revolution
he suggests that prostitution migration from the countryside to the capital and the <unk> of extended families are the root causes of the chaos he says still <unk> in this area
there were hundreds or thousands of <unk> down there
the people left there today are the daughters and the <unk> of the <unk>
that's important to note in social terms
this was never a normal neighborhood he explained with a <unk>
gutierrez worked for twenty six years as a journalist for state run newspapers and magazines
but when he began publishing his crude and critical brand of fiction he was fired
he's pushed the boundaries of free speech in cuba but has never been jailed for speaking his mind
he seems to have little intention of keeping quiet
i'm soon going to be sixty five
i have to take advantage of those years to say what i have to say
people don't <unk>
they just die with their <unk> shut
when you have ideas you have to express them gutierrez said
his <unk> depiction of his neighbors here in central havana may seem harsh
but walking the streets you can quickly see he may have a <unk> point
a few doors from his apartment building there's the entrance to the local revolutionary defense committee a neighborhood group set up to promote the values of the revolution
on the door a black and white photo of a young fidel castro
<unk> opposite is a small store with <unk> bars at the window
the only thing inside a huge <unk> of white rum
a half measure sells for forty <unk> and a full seven hundred and fifty <unk> goes for eighty <unk>
it was only mid morning but a man <unk> through the trash outside pulled out a small plastic bottle and with <unk> hands asked for a fill up
that surely can not be what castro <unk> in the poster across the street had in mind
a land where tourists drink <unk> filled <unk> while a few blocks away an <unk> worker <unk> back a huge <unk> of train <unk> the name cubans <unk> give to cheap industrial strength rum
this neighborhood always was on the <unk> of all the talk of revolutionary <unk>
maybe in the <unk> and <unk> when there was some kind of revolutionary pride it was a little different
but generally people stayed on the <unk> gutierrez told me
while his works are <unk> critical of the decades long social <unk> in his neighborhood his overall <unk> on life and the cuban system is more <unk>
when castro and his rebels seized power in one thousand nine hundred and fifty nine gutierrez was seven years old selling ice cream on havana's streets
he recalls the brutality of the <unk> dictatorship of general <unk> <unk> and the celebrations and hopes for <unk> freedom <unk> in by the rebel forces
there was a lot of joy in the first few days
it was like freedom had arrived he said
despite the experiences of the decades since then gutierrez says he still considers himself a romantic <unk>
he <unk> suggestions that he has anything in common with cuba's right wing <unk> movement
i think is trying to save the good things of <unk> and the revolution like education health and national pride
we still have to advance a great deal in human rights and personal freedoms he added
for some of <unk> neighbors change can not come fast enough
it's past midnight in a dive bar on <unk> street
a washed up <unk> <unk> <unk> along to a <unk> tune on the tv then asks for a double strength rum and <unk>
he says he was a <unk> olympic and pan american games champion
when it comes to <unk> cuba has proved itself to be in a sporting class of its own
but now fifty <unk> has little left to show for his <unk> years except for a nose like a <unk> of <unk> broken so many times he has no <unk> left
in a hotel bar a few doors down on havana's <unk> waterfront a thirty three year old woman clad in leopard print hot <unk> <unk> on a <unk> beer and strikes up a conversation
she says police once gave her a ticket for <unk> tourists official speak for prostitution
she says her day job is a physical education teacher for primary school children
she <unk> just ten dollar a month with her state <unk> and <unk> that in the <unk> of one of her false <unk>
but she says the job provides her with a vital cover story
having legitimate employment she says keeps her out of trouble with the law when she turns <unk> at night
she charges her foreign clients one hundred dollar a night if they don't bargain her down she says
like many others she has high hopes that she will be able to cash in on the potential <unk> of american tourists after president barack obama's announcement of more stable u.s. cuba relations
but back up the street gutierrez is not convinced there will be a quick fix to those relations
the problem he says are elderly cubans on both sides of the florida straits
for more than half a century there's been a lot of hatred between cubans in the u.s. and those on the island
there's been a lot of <unk> for revenge
we have to wait for the years to pass and the old men to die he says
only then can we resolve things in a civilized way
cuban author <unk> juan gutierrez has spent three decades watching and writing about the streets of what he calls central havana's dirty reality
the aircraft's cockpit voice recorder which captures all <unk> on the flight deck was recovered last week from the <unk> of the java sea along with the other so called black box the flight data recorder
the voice from the cockpit does not show any sign of a terrorist attack
it is only the pilot <unk> very busy <unk> <unk> an investigator at indonesia's national transportation safety committee said in an interview with the news agency reuters
he said monday that investigators had heard no threats in the <unk>
we didn't hear any voice of other persons other than the pilots <unk> <unk> another investigator told reuters
but it remains a mystery what brought down the aircraft on december twenty eight as it flew from the indonesian city of surabaya toward singapore with one hundred and sixty two people on board
flight qz eight thousand five hundred and one was traveling through an area of heavy thunderstorms when it crashed
the pilot requested permission to turn and climb to a higher altitude because of the weather before contact was lost with air traffic control according to indonesian officials
was weather <unk> failure or human error to blame
investigators have to be very <unk> before they make any <unk> calls according to christopher <unk> a former fbi agent who investigated the crash of <unk> flight eight hundred off the coast of new york in one thousand nine hundred and ninety six
you want to make absolutely certain before you rule anything in for sure or rule anything out for sure he told cnn
investigators need to identify whether the crash was caused by a problem that could affect other flight crews or aircraft <unk> said
while transportation officials focus on <unk> out what happened search teams are still looking for most of the bodies of the people who were on board the plane
more than three weeks after the crash the remains of fifty three people have been recovered some of them still strapped into seats
many of the rest could be in the wreckage of the fuselage which searchers located last week at the bottom of the sea
but their efforts to examine and get inside the wreckage have been hindered by high waves and strong currents
the divers couldn't even reach the bottom which hampered our operation supriyadi an operations coordinator for indonesia's search and rescue agency told reporters
they did managed to recover a few <unk> of debris from the area including passenger windows and seats airasia said in a statement
search officials have said they are considering using giant balloons to lift the roughly one hundred foot long fuselage from the <unk> to the surface as they did with the tail section of the aircraft earlier this month
the foreign ministry in beijing responded monday to the publication by german magazine der <unk> of new documents purportedly from <unk> <unk> edward <unk>

cyber attacks are hard to trace back and are usually committed across borders
this complexity means that it is extremely difficult to identify the source of the attacks
one document reveals that u.s. authorities believe china stole many <unk> of data related to its new state of the art f thirty five fighter jet including detailed engine <unk> and radar design
cnn has not been able to independently confirm the authenticity of the document

according to <unk> f. johnson a correspondent for <unk> <unk> <unk> weekly the <unk> thirty one looks <unk> and its shape <unk> that of the f thirty five in some respects but it's <unk> whether it rivals its american <unk> from a performance and technological point of view

and the prime minister's residence was under attack from the street sakkaf said
the regime still controlled the city of aden and it closed the port of aden as well as roads leading into and out of sanaa according to yemeni state tv which is controlled by the government
the global stakes are high
yemen is home to al qaeda in the arabian peninsula or aqap the terror network linked to such attacks as the recent slaughter at french satirical publication charlie hebdo
aqap also tried to blow up a plane landing in detroit in two thousand and nine
the battle against aqap has helped make yemen's government a u.s. ally in the fight against al qaeda
a power vacuum often benefits terrorist groups
the yemeni government has been <unk> with pressure not only from the sunni muslim aqap but also from houthi militants shiite muslims who have long felt marginalized in the majority sunni country
seven things to know about yemen
we are the victims of corruption and false promises houthi rebel leader <unk> malik al houthi said in a televised address on a network controlled by houthis and based in <unk> lebanon
the government did not respect the peace and partnership deal from september
we are trying to bring some legitimacy to the government
he complained of economic struggles and poverty
al houthi also said there is an international conspiracy to link yemen to the attacks in paris
yemeni people have two options to move against the foreign <unk> or stand against them firmly since they seek to spread chaos in yemen
this is why we moved with the yemeni people though many powers inside and outside yemen are angered
but the yemeni people are with us and understand our goals he said
aqap claimed responsibility for the charlie hebdo attack and u.s. investigators have worked on the <unk> that attacker said kouachi met the late american terrorist cleric anwar al awlaki at some point in yemen and received orders from aqap a u.s. official told cnn
tuesday's developments came a day after heavy fighting between government forces and houthis left nine people dead and sixty seven others injured yemen's health ministry said before the sides agreed to a ceasefire
gunfire could be heard <unk> across sanaa on tuesday
unknown assailants fired shots monday night at a u.s. embassy vehicle in sanaa the u.s. embassy said tuesday
the <unk> fired first into the air and then turned the guns on the vehicle the embassy said
the vehicle carried u.s. diplomatic personnel and was at a checkpoint near the embassy at the time
no injuries were reported
the embassy is known to use <unk> that are <unk> as u.s. government vehicles
two u.s. navy <unk> moved into new positions in the red sea late monday to be ready to evacuate americans from the embassy if needed a u.s. official with direct knowledge of the planning told cnn
u.n. secretary general ban <unk> moon called on all sides to immediately <unk> all <unk> exercise maximum restraint and take the necessary steps to restore full authority to the legitimate government institutions
members of the u.n. security council were briefed by the u.n. special adviser on yemen <unk> <unk> and later issued a statement expressing their concern about the crisis
they stressed that hadi is the country's legitimate authority
the members of the security council emphasized that all parties and political actors in yemen must stand with president hadi prime minister bahah and yemen's cabinet to keep the country on track to stability and security the statement read
houthis swept into the capital last year <unk> battles that left more than three hundred dead in a month
in september they signed a ceasefire deal with the government and houthis have since installed themselves in key positions in the government and financial institutions
but tensions <unk> again last weekend as houthis said they abducted presidential chief of staff ahmed bin mubarak in sanaa on saturday
osama sari senior media adviser to the houthi movement in yemen said houthis detained bin mubarak because the president wanted to <unk> a new constitution without the houthis approval
the children along with teachers and activists were <unk> after the playground was walled off during the holidays said <unk> <unk> who participated in the protest
the playground near the <unk> primary school had reportedly been confiscated for the construction of a parking lot
video showed students and activists pushing kicking and hitting the wall with <unk> of wood
children wearing their green school <unk> held signs calling the <unk> of the playground terror against children and kenya the land of <unk> <unk>
some of the students taking part were as young as six <unk> said
riot police responded to the demonstration by <unk> <unk> of tear gas that sent the children <unk> in <unk>
as news of the <unk> actions spread thousands of people voiced anger on social media using the hashtag <unk>
children were promised <unk> not <unk> of tear gas tweeted former kenyan vice president <unk> <unk>
someone must be held accountable
some children were treated in hospital after the incident <unk> said
at least one police officer was also hurt
kenyan media reported that the police officer in charge of the operation at the playground has been suspended
police didn't respond to cnn's request for comment
some people on social media blamed the adult activists for the chaotic scenes
what has <unk> achieved apart from crying <unk> children activists pushing agenda via kids
wrote a twitter user on the handle <unk>
this is kids action he said
they want back their playground and they came back to get their playground
the children were set to go back to school tuesday
but not without the memory of what <unk> called a dark sad day for kenya
the else being that the pair will meet the same gruesome fate as other captives held by the terrorist group others who were shown in isis videos kneeling in orange <unk> in front of masked black clad men just like the japanese hostages identified as kenji goto <unk> and haruna yukawa shortly before being beheaded
in the latest video a masked man gives the japanese government a choice to pay two hundred million dollar the same amount of money prime minister shinzo abe recently pledged for those <unk> with isis to free the japanese men
that deal holds for seventy two hours which would seem to mean <unk> friday since the video appeared on social media tuesday
another move that <unk> could change things would be if japan's government <unk> its alliance with those fighting isis which calls itself the islamic state
tokyo hasn't participated in airstrikes aimed at the islamist extremist group though its leaders have supported those who have as well as the iraqi government
although you are more than eight thousand five hundred kilometers away from the islamic state you <unk> volunteered to take part in this <unk> the masked man on the video posted tuesday says addressing his comments to abe
but abe who is visiting the middle east didn't seem about to bargain tuesday
he stood by a pledge made in a speech at the weekend in cairo for funding to help build human <unk> infrastructure and so on for those affected by isis armed campaign
the pledge aid is very important to the refugees in need and has nothing to do with the islamic communities or the radical militants the prime minister said
we will contribute to the peace and stability in cooperation with the global community
as to the isis threat against two of his nation's citizens abe called it unacceptable
i feel angry about it he said
i strongly urge them to immediately release the hostages without <unk> them
isis has asked for ransoms before and apparently has been paid them
but rarely are such demands made publicly
even <unk> unprecedented in fact is when the militant group puts its captives on video and threatens them then <unk> them go
instead isis has made a public show out of its threatening and killings of western hostages starting with <unk> beheading of u.s. journalist james foley
others killings were similarly recorded and posted online including american journalist steven sotloff british aid worker david <unk> british taxi driver alan <unk> and u.s. aid worker peter kassig
while not participating in ground combat both the united states and great britain have taken an active role in the anti isis fight with airstrikes and training <unk> and otherwise supporting groups such as iraq's military kurdish fighters and moderate syrian opposition taking on the militants face to face
that's not the case for japan whose post world war ii constitution allows it to use its military only for self defense
but tokyo is a strong ally with western powers such as the united states that have been singled out by isis
in his remarks tuesday in jerusalem abe who dealt with another hostage crisis involving islamic militants in january two thousand and thirteen when ten japanese citizens were caught up in the terrorist <unk> of a natural gas facility in algeria said he had ordered japanese officials to do the utmost to try to save the two men
at the same time the prime minister added terrorists should not be forgiven for any reason
i criticize <unk>
the aim is to safely bring home two men who were in the same war torn region for very different reasons
like foley and sotloff goto went there to help tell the story of what was happening in iraq and syria
in recent months isis militants have managed to take over vast swaths of both countries <unk> going after many in their way who don't share their extremist interpretation of islam
the isis video refers to him as kenji goto <unk> but on his twitter handle and a photograph <unk> to him he's just called kenji goto
the freelance journalist reported for various japanese news organizations about the situation in the northern syrian <unk> city of kobani which for weeks has been under siege by isis and other areas
while it's not known when he was taken captive goto's last twitter post was on october twenty three
the man purportedly shown along with him yukawa is believed to have been captured in syria in august while traveling with rebel fighters according to the japanese news agency <unk>
the forty two year old claimed to have set up a company in tokyo providing armed security services and posted videos online of his activities in iraq and syria
but a report by the news agency reuters in august portrayed him as a lost soul who went to the middle east searching for a purpose after losing his wife his business and his home over the previous decade
<unk> reported previously that japanese officials in jordan had being trying to secure his release including talking to various groups with possible connections to his captors
abe spoke firmly tuesday against the terrorists and their two hundred million dollar ransom demand
what he did not do however is rule out the japanese government paying ransom or negotiating with its two citizens captors
like most countries japan has never <unk> that it or japanese companies have paid ransom for hostages
in fact japanese government officials have at times denied such a practice and japan is a <unk> to a two thousand and thirteen g eight <unk> that stated we unequivocally reject the payment of ransoms to terrorists and we call on countries and companies around the world to follow our lead to <unk> this out
one reason for this policy is that isis and groups like it can use ransoms to fund their bloody campaigns
paying ransoms also may give them <unk> to take more hostages thus putting more people at risk
and ransoms might not always work since isis and other hostage takers aren't usually seen as <unk>
still ruling out ransoms also rules out one peaceful way to free goto and yukawa
it's possible someone else may <unk> to negotiate their release whether out of goodwill or in exchange for something else
or troops from a japanese ally could launch a raid to get to them like the unsuccessful one this summer to free foley
either way others could play a role in this story before it's done <unk> <unk> comment tuesday that the international community needs to deal with terrorists without giving in to them
i have just spoken with the national defense and security council secretary

at the time belgian media were suggesting he may have returned to verviers and been killed in the police raid
they were too <unk> to talk
at that moment they had no idea whether <unk> was alive or dead
the imam of the local mosque franck <unk> told cnn they had not seen <unk> since two thousand and thirteen
he had been a serious but kind boy and had worked in a local restaurant the imam said
<unk> and the president of the mosque <unk> <unk> said that extremism was not common among muslims in verviers but that fewer young people were attending the mosque and instead were being influenced elsewhere
while the identities of the two men killed in the police raid have not been disclosed it now seems <unk> is still alive and likely still in syria or iraq one of dozens of young belgian men and women who have left their <unk> industrial towns to wage jihad in iraq and syria
a recent study by the brookings institution in washington estimated that at least two hundred and fifty individuals have left belgium fewer than the number from britain and france but the highest in europe when <unk> per capita
other sources put the number above three hundred
one of them posted a photograph of himself brandishing an automatic weapon and with an ammunition belt round his neck

he was reportedly the fourth resident of <unk> to leave for syria

one posted on facebook
everything you need is available here be it clothes or things for your home we have everything
and a tip
don't behave like a warrior
<unk> your beards behave like tourists and buy tickets back and forth
precise figures on the number of europeans who have gone to iraq and syria and which groups they have joined are hard to come by
the consensus among counter terrorism analysts is that more than three thousand have traveled of whom five hundred have returned including up to seventy who have come back to belgium
of those who have gone there appears to have been a sharp shift toward joining the islamic state in iraq and syria in the last year
van <unk> <unk>
if there is one important difference between those who left during the first wave and the second it would be their favor to fight for the islamic state
and isis has made it clear it plans to send fighters to europe once western forces are in its words defeated in iraq and syria
an <unk> group called sharia four belgium is suspected of <unk> the travel of some would be jihadists
nearly fifty of its members are currently on trial in antwerp but almost all are being tried in <unk>
guy van <unk> an <unk> journalist with belgian newspaper <unk> <unk> <unk> who tracks jihadist networks told cnn that sharia four belgium had <unk> because of prosecutions and the flow of members to syria
as an <unk> network though i think it still exists
and from time to time people try some kind of <unk> van <unk> said
one of the group that went to fight is <unk> <unk> <unk> a belgian moroccan from antwerp in his <unk> who is believed to be in raqqa isis's self declared capital and has a facebook page in the name of abu <unk>
after the attack on a jewish museum in belgium by a gunman accused of allegiance to isis he wrote on facebook page
may allah raise up more young people who take the example of those who committed the attack in the jewish museum
analysts of islamist extremism in europe talk of a third generation muslim <unk> and men in their early <unk> intensely <unk> from the countries to which their parents and grandparents <unk> in hope of a better life
a significant minority among them feel marginalized within their own country and are <unk> by isis's slick <unk> propaganda machine
some even see the kouachi brothers who attacked the offices of charlie hebdo in paris as heroes
there were a number of incidents in french schools when the <unk> silence for the victims was <unk>
one college teacher in a suburb of paris with a high muslim population told cnn that since the paris attacks some muslim students had adopted the slogan <unk> as a <unk> to <unk>
few of them will ever pack their bags but they could easily be further radicalized at home
most of those who do make it to syria are <unk> recruits with few skills
but they learn fast and one worrying <unk> of the conflict to western analysts is the coming together of this third generation with veteran jihadists men like <unk> <unk>
now forty eight <unk> left prison in two thousand and eleven after serving a long terror sentence
he is thought to have trained in afghanistan and as a young man had been condemned to death in his native morocco for trying to <unk> the monarchy
on facebook last year he suggested he was in aleppo syria
his current <unk> are unknown
while european intelligence agencies <unk> to tackle the first wave of <unk> some analysts offer a few <unk> of comfort
among the hundreds who have followed their dream of jihad some never imagine returning home

others are killed or become suicide bombers
a few return home <unk> with the violence
the brookings study says the threat posed by foreign fighters could be reduced by better co operation among european intelligence services
intelligence from the communications of foreign fighters shared open source monitoring and other information obtained by one service can prove crucial for <unk> <unk> networks it says
van <unk> says that given their modest resources the belgian security services have been <unk> in tracking fighters
i truly think for example that the jewish museum attack wouldn't have happened with a perpetrator from belgium itself he told cnn
four people were shot dead at the museum in brussels last year
the alleged <unk> a french national named <unk> <unk> was arrested in france <unk> the additional problem posed by europe's open borders
twenty six european states are part of the <unk> agreement which <unk> passport and immigration controls between <unk>
in paris analysts and former officers in the security services have long been critical of the lack of <unk> between france's police and the domestic and foreign intelligence services in the wake of the paris attacks
that lack of communication became apparent after the <unk> shootings in two thousand and twelve when mohamed <unk> killed seven people across several days in <unk>
governments in northern europe now face threats on multiple fronts from <unk> organized cells with ready access to weapons and in many cases the expertise to use them
last july <unk> <unk> <unk> and peter van <unk> warned in the new york times that policy makers <unk> <unk> with foreign fighters could be a <unk> from a more serious domestic terrorist threat

by showing students as young as six how robots can solve real world problems fundi bots founder <unk> king benge wants young people to develop a creative skill set they can apply to solve issues specific to their lives
we have a team in northern uganda building an <unk> farming program explains thirty two year old king benge
the project includes an <unk> system for crops and also a temperature monitoring solution to make sure
<unk> feed doesn't <unk> and go bad
the students are also working on an automatic <unk> <unk> to feed pigs
in a country where over ninety percents of primary school aged children are enrolled in classes according to world bank data fundi bots first focuses on <unk> time <unk> in schools
as well as <unk> and video based learning fundi bots also offers hands on robotics training and helps keen students form weekly robotics clubs
the initiative has taken off in fifteen schools spread across the capital <unk> and <unk> in the north where experienced <unk> visit once or twice a month to offer ideas and <unk>
but <unk> with robotic parts and coming up with new ideas carries on after school too
during holiday camps students are taught robotic <unk> and then given time to implement that learning by building a robot by the end of the camp
central to the fundi bots philosophy is that building robots does not require a fortune
students are encouraged to use <unk> materials or components like laser <unk> and <unk> that were never originally designed to be a robotic building block
one group of thirteen and fourteen year <unk> is creating a small remote controlled vehicle with a temperature <unk> on the front that could be used in fire risk areas king benge explains
their idea uses a <unk> <unk> which sends data back in real time but they managed to keep costs quite low at around one hundred and thirty dollar by using locally <unk> materials like wheels from toy cars
while the physical components may not command high prices the skills students gain in the process could prove lucrative
according to <unk> <unk> the global market for robotics <unk> to twenty five point eight billion dollar in june two thousand and fourteen and is expected to grow to more than seventy billion dollar by two thousand and twenty
while the fundi bots program is showing initial signs of having an impact in uganda king benge says that's just the start
fundi bots is based in uganda but our five year <unk> is to build a presence in five african countries by the end of two thousand and twenty explains king benge
the most promising country at the moment is rwanda because the government is very forward thinking and very keen to develop as the <unk> <unk> in the region
fundi bots which held a <unk> in rwanda last october might be the first robotics teaching program in uganda but it is not the only one of its kind in africa
the african robotics network was established in ghana in april two thousand and twelve to improve education around robotics
one way the group has worked on this goal is by organizing the week long <unk> robotics experience
it was during this set of workshops that a <unk> developed the <unk> a basic mini <unk> robot which can navigate obstacles and learn about its <unk>
the robot which uses <unk> <unk> <unk> in the design can be built from <unk> for a total cost of just eight dollar point ninety six
the enthusiasm of the kids is incredible says <unk> <unk> assistant computer science professor at <unk> university college and co founder of the african robotics network
recognizing that a robot can be made from familiar items like a computer <unk> or game <unk> really <unk> robotics and <unk> for them
robots are also playing a more prominent role in <unk> the capital of the democratic republic of congo
eight feet tall robotic traffic <unk> designed and built by a team of local engineers have been recording and controlling traffic twenty four hours a day for just less than a year
as the <unk> students learn new ways to build robots king benge says there's no limit to what could emerge from the workshops and <unk>
when i see the students coming up with innovative ideas i really see minds are being changed
students are being exposed to the creative process and i look forward to seeing them come up with bigger projects in five or ten years time

the terror cell planned to target police officers he said
belgian counterterrorism agencies think the suspected ringleader of the cell is likely abaaoud the senior belgian counterterrorism official said
according to guy van <unk> a reporter at the belgian newspaper <unk> who tracks belgian foreign fighters in syria for the blog <unk> abaaoud is a twenty seven year old from the molenbeek district of brussels who traveled to syria in january two thousand and fourteen and joined isis soon afterward
the two gunmen killed in the verviers raid <unk> of north african descent from the same brussels district were in phone contact with an isis ringleader in greece who belgian authorities believe was likely abaaoud

belgian counterterrorism officials believe the cell had ambitious attack plans beyond attacking police given bomb making <unk> found in their safe house in verviers and police uniforms
they also suspect terrorists were plotting multiple attacks
the belief is that the cell has now been disrupted and will take some time to get back on its feet
the wider cell was being monitored for less than two months
over the last several weeks belgian security services started monitoring the verviers group twenty four seven
why did police move in last week
one reason the official said is that the cell obtained weapons and belgian police could not continue round the clock surveillance <unk>

before the siege he had proclaimed his allegiance to the islamic state in iraq and syria or isis
the assault happened during three days of terror in france that began with the attack on offices of the charlie hebdo satirical newspaper in paris
in all twelve people died in the charlie hebdo attack on january seven
al qaeda in the arabian peninsula al qaeda's yemen affiliate claimed responsibility for the charlie hebdo shootings
on monday cnn affiliate bfmtv reported charlie hebdo cartoonist laurent <unk> will succeed editor stephane charbonnier who died in the attack
although french officials said they thought cherif kouachi had given up terror related activities and moved to end surveillance on him after he began selling <unk> goods it turns out the proceeds from those sales were being used to buy weapons a source familiar with the ongoing investigation in france told cnn
that's just one of several <unk> by intelligence agencies in france being revealed by the investigation into the attacks the source said
other <unk> include a lack of communication and delays in circulating information according to the source
in one case a french surveillance agency received an alert about one of the kouachi brothers phones in february two thousand and fourteen but it took four months for information to be passed on to the country's main domestic spy agency the source said
by then neither brother was under surveillance the source said
the surveillance on cherif kouachi ended in november two thousand and <unk> the surveillance on said kouachi the older brother ended in june sources have told cnn
also authorities now say they think both said and cherif kouachi traveled to yemen in two thousand and eleven via oman even though <unk> passport had been confiscated in two thousand and ten
however investigators have been unable to find either <unk> name in travel <unk> according to the source
on sunday hours before he was set to testify before the national congress about his allegation he was found dead in his apartment the country's ministry of security said monday
nisman fifty one who had been investigating the jewish community center bombing that occurred more than twenty years ago was found in his bathroom with a twenty two <unk> gun and shell <unk> nearby the ministry said
no cause of death has been released but according to the buenos aires herald security secretary <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> secretary general to the presidency said there are signs that nisman's death was a suicide
the forensic investigation is crucial
in forensic science when you have a body a <unk> and a weapon everything leads to one place <unk> said according to the newspaper
we have to wait for the judicial to confirm
buenos aires police will conduct tests on nisman's hands to see if there is gunpowder on them the state run <unk> news agency reported
such a test would be necessary to determine whether he committed suicide
as the days go by and we have the results from the autopsy we will be able to determine the cause of death
i can't <unk> a <unk>
that wouldn't be <unk> <unk> <unk> the federal prosecutor leading the investigation into nisman's death told reporters in buenos aires
i can confirm that there was a gun a twenty two <unk> gun
i can confirm that he died due to a gunshot
i can not confirm further details
i will find those out in the coming days
the prosecutor had been under the protection of a ten man security detail members of which belonged to the federal police
the detail called his secretary sunday afternoon to say he wasn't answering his phone <unk> reported
when he didn't answer his <unk> and his sunday newspaper was found on his <unk> the security detail reached out to his family
the detail took nisman's mother to his apartment in le <unk> tower a high rise in the <unk> <unk> neighborhood of buenos aires and upon finding the door locked from the inside with the key still in the <unk> nisman's relatives reached out to a <unk> the agency reported
nisman's mother and a guard later found the prosecutor's body blocking a bathroom door inside his room <unk> said
nisman was set to testify to lawmakers behind closed doors on a report alleging that president <unk> <unk> de kirchner foreign minister <unk> timerman and other officials had covered up iran's involvement in the bombing of the argentine <unk> mutual association building
the attack killed eighty five people and wounded more than three hundred
<unk> de kirchner and timerman wanted to cover up iran's involvement in order to boost trade specifically oil imports and grain exports with the islamic republic nisman alleged last week according to the herald
chief of the cabinet of ministers <unk> <unk> told cnn and other media outlets that nisman's allegation is crazy <unk> <unk> <unk> ridiculous <unk>
timerman also <unk> rejected the accusations last week
appointed in two thousand and four by <unk> de <unk> late husband then president <unk> kirchner nisman told members of the argentine opposition that he had documents to back his allegations the herald reported
he was also expected to <unk> sources for his research
<unk> patricia <unk> who represents buenos aires in the national congress lower house and who organized the hearing said she spoke with nisman on saturday
he said he was very threatened and he knew that this was a very heavy topic she said
i am very <unk>
argentine prosecutors have long accused iran of involvement in the bombing and requested the arrest of iranian citizens in connection with it among them former defense minister ahmad <unk> former iranian president ali akbar <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> head of iran's revolutionary guard at the time of the attack
in two thousand and thirteen argentine lawmakers approved the creation of a truth commission designed to investigate the bombing in conjunction with iran
the national criminal court is investigating nisman's death the security ministry said
his body has been sent to a <unk> for autopsy <unk> told cnn
israel's foreign ministry in a statement to media outlets called nisman a brave and prominent <unk> who fought <unk> for justice as he worked to expose those behind the one thousand nine hundred and ninety four attack
the state of israel voices hope that argentine authorities will continue with nisman's activities and make every effort to exact justice on those responsible for the terrorist attacks in argentina the statement said
the anti <unk> league called for a full and <unk> investigation into nisman's death which it <unk> another tragic episode that will extend the decades long delays in bringing the iranian <unk> and perpetrators to justice
the timing and circumstances of mr. nisman's death coming just days after he released detailed allegations of high level government attempts to <unk> his investigation and hours before he was scheduled to present additional details to members of the argentine congress raise serious questions about whether mr. nisman's death was related to his work on the <unk> bombing <unk> national director <unk> <unk> said in a statement
so says a new report which estimates that the richest one percents will have as much wealth as the other ninety nine percents combined by next year
the richest one percents have seen their share of global wealth increase from forty four percents in two thousand and nine to forty eight percents in two thousand and fourteen oxfam says in a report monday
at that rate the <unk> will own more than fifty percents by next year according to the report
do we really want to live in a world where the one percents own more than the rest of us combined
asked <unk> <unk> executive director of the international aid agency
<unk> will co chair the annual world economic forum in davos this week
she plans to use the platform at davos to call for urgent action on the rising inequality
the eighty richest people on the planet have the same wealth as the poorest three point five billion people the report says
the scale of global inequality is quite simply staggering
and despite the issues shooting up the global agenda the gap between the richest and the rest is widening fast she said
it is time our leaders took on the powerful <unk> interests that stand in the way of a <unk> and more prosperous world
while one percents of the population owns forty eight percents of the world's wealth a majority of the <unk> follows the same trend
of the remaining fifty two percents of global wealth forty six percents is owned by the rest of the richest fifth of the world's population the report says
the <unk> of the population only <unk> five point five percents of global wealth
their wealth last year
an average three thousand eight hundred and fifty one dollar per adult the report says
meanwhile the global elite members had an average wealth of two point seven million dollar each last year it says
the report comes a day before president barack obama is expected to <unk> <unk> that close tax <unk> on the wealthy
obama will discuss his plans to help the middle class during his state of the union address on tuesday
millions of people demonstrated in condemnation of the <unk> <unk> by a <unk> of horror under the banner i am charlie
there were <unk> <unk> of outrage captured well by the head of israel's labor party and the main challenger for the upcoming elections <unk> <unk> who declared that terrorism is terrorism
there's no two ways about it and that all the nations that seek peace and freedom face an enormous challenge from brutal violence
the crimes also <unk> a flood of commentary <unk> into the roots of these shocking assaults in islamic culture and exploring ways to counter the <unk> wave of islamic terrorism without <unk> our values
the new york times described the assault as a <unk> of <unk> but was <unk> by times columnist <unk> <unk> who tweeted that it was not and never a war of <unk> or between them
but a war for civilization against groups on the other side of that line
<unk>
the scene in paris was described <unk> in the new york times by veteran europe correspondent steven erlanger
a day of <unk> helicopters in the air <unk> news <unk>
of police <unk> and <unk> crowds
of young children led away from schools to safety
it was a day like the previous two of blood and horror in and around paris
erlanger also quoted a surviving journalist who said that everything crashed
there was no way out
there was smoke everywhere
it was terrible
people were screaming
it was like a nightmare
another reported a huge <unk> and everything went completely dark
the scene erlanger reported was an increasingly familiar one of <unk> glass broken walls <unk> <unk> <unk> paint and emotional devastation
these last quotes however as independent journalist david <unk> <unk> us are not from january two thousand and fifteen
rather they are from a report by erlanger on april twenty four one thousand nine hundred and ninety nine which received far less attention
erlanger was reporting on the nato missile attack on serbian state television headquarters that <unk> radio television serbia off the air killing sixteen journalists
nato and american officials defended the attack erlanger reported as an effort to undermine the regime of president <unk> <unk> of yugoslavia
pentagon spokesman <unk> <unk> told a briefing in washington that <unk> tv is as much a part of <unk> murder machine as his military is <unk> a legitimate target of attack
there were no demonstrations or <unk> of outrage no <unk> of we are <unk> no <unk> into the roots of the attack in christian culture and history
on the contrary the attack on the press was <unk>
the highly regarded u.s. <unk> richard <unk> then envoy to yugoslavia described the successful attack on <unk> as an <unk> important and i think positive development a sentiment echoed by others
there are many other events that call for no inquiry into western culture and history for example the worst single terrorist <unk> in europe in recent years in july two thousand and eleven when <unk> <unk> a christian ultra <unk> extremist and <unk> slaughtered seventy seven people mostly <unk>
also ignored in the war against terrorism is the most extreme terrorist campaign of modern times barack obama's global assassination campaign targeting people suspected of perhaps intending to harm us some day and any <unk> who happen to be nearby
other <unk> are also not <unk> such as the fifty civilians reportedly killed in a u.s. led bombing raid in syria in december which was barely reported
one person was indeed punished in connection with the nato attack on <unk> <unk> <unk> the general manager of the station who was sentenced by the european court of human rights to ten years in prison for failing to evacuate the building according to the committee to protect journalists
the international criminal <unk> for yugoslavia considered the nato attack <unk> that it was not a crime and although civilian casualties were unfortunately high they do not appear to be clearly <unk>
the comparison between these cases helps us understand the condemnation of the new york times by civil rights lawyer <unk> <unk> famous for his <unk> defense of freedom of expression
there are times for self restraint <unk> wrote but in the immediate wake of the most threatening assault on journalism in living memory the times editors would have served the cause of free expression best by engaging in it by publishing the charlie hebdo cartoons <unk> mohammed that <unk> the assault
<unk> is right in describing the charlie hebdo attack as the most threatening assault on journalism in living memory
the reason has to do with the concept living memory a category carefully constructed to include their crimes against us while <unk> <unk> our crimes against them the latter not crimes but <unk> defense of the highest values sometimes <unk> <unk>
this is not the place to <unk> into just what was being defended when <unk> was attacked but such an inquiry is quite <unk>
there are many other illustrations of the interesting category living memory
one is provided by the marine assault against <unk> in november two thousand and four one of the worst crimes of the u.s. uk invasion of iraq
the assault opened with occupation of <unk> general hospital a major war crime quite apart from how it was carried out
the crime was reported <unk> on the front page of the new york times accompanied with a photograph depicting how patients and hospital employees were rushed out of rooms by armed soldiers and ordered to sit or lie on the floor while troops tied their hands behind their backs
the occupation of the hospital was considered <unk> and justified
it shut down what officers said was a propaganda weapon for the militants
<unk> general hospital with its stream of reports of civilian casualties
<unk> this is no assault on free expression and does not <unk> for entry into living memory
there are other questions
one would naturally ask how france <unk> freedom of expression and the sacred principles of <unk> freedom solidarity
for example is it through the <unk> law repeatedly implemented which effectively <unk> the state the right to determine historical truth and punish <unk> from its <unk>
by <unk> <unk> <unk> of holocaust survivors to bitter persecution in eastern europe
by the <unk> treatment of north african immigrants in the banlieues of paris where the charlie hebdo terrorists became jihadis
when the <unk> journal charlie hebdo fired the cartoonist <unk> on grounds that a comment of his was deemed to have anti semitic <unk>
many more questions quickly arise
anyone with eyes open will quickly notice other rather striking <unk>
thus prominent among those who face an enormous challenge from brutal violence are palestinians once again during israel's vicious assault on gaza in the summer of two thousand and fourteen in which many journalists were murdered sometimes in well marked press cars along with thousands of others while the israeli run outdoor prison was again reduced to rubble on <unk> that collapse <unk> on examination
also ignored was the assassination of three more journalists in latin america in december bringing the number for the year to thirty one
there have been more than a dozen journalists killed in <unk> alone since the military coup of two thousand and nine that was effectively recognized by the u.s. probably according post coup <unk> the per capita <unk> for murder of journalists
but again not an assault on freedom of press within living memory
it is not difficult to elaborate
these few examples <unk> a very general principle that is observed with impressive <unk> and <unk>
the more we can blame some crimes on enemies the greater the outrage
the greater our responsibility for crimes and <unk> the more we can do to end them the less the concern <unk> to <unk> or even denial
contrary to the <unk> <unk> it is not the case that terrorism is terrorism
there's no two ways about it
there definitely are two ways about it
theirs versus <unk>
and not just terrorism
more from <unk>
two thousand and thirteen
israel's west bank plans will leave palestinians very little
the airbus a three hundred six hundred st <unk> known as the beluga because of its <unk> to the white arctic <unk> is the european plane <unk> super sized <unk> jet
five of these enormous planes make more than sixty flights each week carrying parts for all of airbus planes from manufacturing sites wings in the uk <unk> in spain for example to the final assembly facilities in either <unk> <unk> or <unk>
the planes have been in service since one thousand nine hundred and ninety four but are in need of <unk>
since the plane's <unk> flight <unk> production rates have increased five <unk> so a new fleet is planned to keep up with demand especially with the new a three hundred and fifty <unk> plane now entering service
the need for the new beluga comes with the increase in production rates and to get extra capacity on top of this fleet of five <unk> says stephane <unk> head of airbus transport international
so initially there will be a mixed fleet use of both new beluga and old beluga
and then the second need was as well to <unk> <unk> of an <unk> fleet
a crew of three operates the beluga
two pilots and a <unk>
because of its size the plane <unk> differently to other large jets in <unk>
moving <unk> more than up and down
the five <unk> currently in operation are actually airbus a three hundred six hundred jets that have been <unk> to carry large cargo
the top section of the aircraft was cut and an additional wider fuselage section <unk> a <unk> was added to the <unk> giving it its <unk> <unk>
the cockpit was <unk> making it possible for the cargo hold to be <unk> and <unk> through the front of the aircraft
the result is an incredibly <unk> cargo hold of one thousand four hundred <unk> meters
that's the equivalent to six hundred and seventy one people thirty six cars or seven elephants
the perception you have is of a huge <unk> like a cathedral says <unk>
although the <unk> maximum <unk> of forty seven tons is <unk> by a handful of other cargo aircraft its <unk> hold makes it <unk> for <unk> <unk> but not particularly heavy cargo like aircraft parts

<unk> on streets of tiny village
the beluga can carry the wings of an a three hundred and forty airliner or a fuselage section for airbus <unk> wide body aircraft the a three hundred and fifty
but it's not large enough to transport many a three hundred and eighty super <unk> parts
those need to travel by boat <unk> and road
with the a three hundred now out of service the new <unk> will be based on the airbus a three hundred and thirty and be bigger than the existing fleet
while the current planes can only carry one wing for the new a three hundred and fifty at a time the new jet will be able to take on board both on the same flight
and for plane <unk> who love the unique shape of the existing beluga that will remain much the same
it will be the same look says <unk> because we will operate both <unk> in parallel for a number of years and it will also be <unk> with existing <unk> means
the first of the new fleet will enter service in two thousand and twenty

in <unk> conditions and on soft snow in the women's downhill at <unk> <unk> italy vonn recorded a time of one minute thirty nine point six one seconds beating <unk> <unk> <unk> by zero point three two seconds
the victory tied vonn with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> who set the <unk> between one thousand nine hundred and seventy and one thousand nine hundred and eighty
i was a little bit nervous in the start the thirty year old said in an interview with the international ski federation website
i thought i <unk> really well on friday but it was tough conditions and i wasn't able to be on top of the <unk>
today was kind of the same the snow was soft but at least it was sunny
i just tried to keep my feet underneath me and not to push the <unk> against the snow too much and it worked out
the victory marks an incredible <unk> for vonn who had been out with a serious knee injury for eighteen months
in a desperate attempt to get fit for the two thousand and fourteen <unk> winter olympics vonn <unk> her knee and needed a second operation
much of the talk since her <unk> has concerned the world cup record which has proved something of a <unk>
every time i'm in the starting gate i'm trying to win whether it's sixty sixty one sixty two or whatever it is i just try to ski my best she said
so it was more <unk> just talking about this record in the media
but for me mentally it was the same as any other race
now i'm happy we can stop talking about it
although few will actually stop talking about it
vonn now has the chance to hold the record outright with sixty three <unk> in monday's super g
i've surprised myself how far i come vonn told cnn after her victory
i'm really excited for another race tomorrow
hopefully i can break the record tomorrow
i love what i do
i want to win as many races as possible
i have a lot more to give the sport
the was one last question to ask
had she spoken to her boyfriend tiger woods
<unk> i talked to him and he said he's really proud of me she confirmed
he was watching with his daughter early in the morning
i was sad he wasn't here but he's training
he's a professional athlete too

there are many children neglected by their own parents glyzelle said sunday at a ceremony at a four hundred year old catholic university in manila
there are also many who became victims and many terrible things happened to them like drugs or prostitution
why is god allowing such things to happen even if it is not the fault of the children
she asked the pope breaking down into tears as she spoke
another former street child jun <unk> told pope francis about his struggle to survive without a home
i was feeding myself with what i can find in the <unk> said jun fourteen
i did not know where to go and i was sleeping on the sidewalk
when i was in the street i witness also things i don't like terrible things that happened to my companions in the street jun said
i saw that they were taught how to <unk> to kill also and they have no respect anymore for the adults
pope francis responded to <unk> question and <unk> testimony by giving the two children a big hug
she is the only one who has put a question for which there is no answer and she wasn't even able to express it in words but in tears the seventy eight year old pope told the crowd
glyzelle and jun are both in the care of <unk> <unk> <unk> foundation a non governmental organization that looks after <unk> street children
the foundation came across glyzelle and her older sister a few years ago said <unk> <unk> the group's communication manager
the girls had left home where their impoverished parents were unable to support them or get them an education and were <unk> for themselves on the street she said
they first attended one of the <unk> drop in centers before moving into a residential facility and starting to attend school
in november their younger brother joined them at the foundation
glyzelle is still in touch with her mother and goes home to see her at christmas <unk> said
the <unk> center where glyzelle lives is home to about forty other former street children
most of them are victims of the terrible things that can happen in the street including physical and sexual abuse <unk> said
but <unk> tears in front of the pope on sunday were apparently prompted by the intensity of the moment not because of her own experiences
she asked the question on behalf of all the children we take care of not because of something personal regarding her own story <unk> said
the pope touched on the street children theme again later sunday when he celebrated mass in a manila park with millions of people despite the <unk> rain
we need to see each child as a gift to be welcomed <unk> and protected he told the enormous crowd
and we need to care for our young not allowing them to be condemned to a life on the streets
the pope had visited the center where glyzelle and others live on friday after celebrating mass at manila cathedral and reportedly said he was very moved by what he saw
there are estimated to be more than one point five million street children in the philippines about seventy thousand of them in the manila metropolitan area according to the he cares foundation another group that cares for them
in his account jun described seeing some of his friends <unk> <unk> and taking other drugs
he said he learned to be <unk> of adults offering money or help because it was often a <unk> to exploit the children
he initially declined an offer of support from <unk> <unk> <unk> foundation but later found out that the organization was <unk> trying to help him
i realized that not all people have no heart he said

that news came after fighting around the presidential palace and came after yemen's prime minister went into hiding when attackers shot at him
nine people were killed and sixty seven others injured <unk> the clashes yemen's health ministry said
the yemeni government a u.s. ally in the battle against al qaeda described the fighting as a power grab by rebels known as houthis shiite muslims who have long felt marginalized in the majority sunni country
turmoil between the two sides is <unk> to the west because a power vacuum in yemen could benefit al qaeda in the arabian peninsula a terrorist organization based in yemen that took credit for the attack on the offices of charlie hebdo in paris
it also tried to blow up a plane landing in detroit in two thousand and nine
a houthi <unk> ali <unk> told cnn that the presidential committee had agreed to a deal after hours of negotiations
interior minister <unk> al <unk> also confirmed the ceasefire had been reached
there are conflicting accounts of the cause of the clashes
government officials <unk> it as a power grab by the houthis
houthis say yemen's military attacked people demanding that authorities lift road <unk> introduced as a security measure after the presidential chief of staff was abducted in sanaa a few days ago
a western <unk> in sanaa told cnn the situation was complex
today's events appear to be the next stage in houthi plans to extend their control in yemen
but there are many players with many <unk>
so this hasn't finished playing out the <unk> said
it is unclear who fired first near the presidential palace monday
control of the palace is seen as key to the control of the country
there were reports of government buildings a hospital and residential buildings being hit
the presidential palace is controlled by the government and <unk> surrounding the palace are held by rebels known as houthis a senior interior ministry official told cnn late monday
both sides will remain where they are until a deal is signed which is expected to happen tuesday said the official
the yemeni information minister told cnn's christiane amanpour that government control is almost <unk>
when asked to described the situation on the ground <unk> al sakkaf said
this is almost a <unk> of what happened in september on the twenty one st of september when the houthis came into the city and took over everything and then there was the peace and partnership agreement where they pulled back a little bit and allowed a government to be created
now since then the houthis have not really left the capital
they've been around with their arms and what happened is that they've been <unk> in the government's work but we were trying to get this country going the minister said
the u.n. security council will hold a special meeting to discuss yemen on tuesday
prime minister khaled bahah was fired upon when he left a meeting with president abd <unk> <unk> hadi and the houthi political group <unk> al sakkaf said
bahah was <unk> and is now in hiding she said
he is at his place but currently he has been surrounded by houthi militias around his place and they have stationed themselves at <unk> of neighboring buildings
he is worried that the situation might escalate said the minister
the senior interior ministry official said the prime minister was inside the republican palace some seven miles from the presidential palace
the gunfire came from a houthi checkpoint near the meeting place and the attempt to kill the prime minister was a <unk> on an earlier ceasefire al sakkaf said
but a senior houthi official condemned the attack and denied the group had anything to do with it blaming the attempt on an <unk> third party
houthis said their convoy had also been fired upon after leaving the talks
adding to the <unk> the information minister said yemeni state tv and the state run <unk> news agency are now under the control of the houthi political movement
but senior houthi official ali <unk> denied the movement controlled either news outlet
there are concerns that as yemen <unk> into greater sectarian violence al qaeda a predominantly sunni group will gain an even greater <unk> there with more recruits and a base from which to attack other targets
this morning it was so chaotic
they said that nobody knew what was going on and who was in charge and these are situations where al qaeda can easily <unk> and create al sakkaf told cnn
al qaeda in the arabian peninsula has its home in yemen where in recent months it has come under pressure from houthi rebels and government forces
but the charlie hebdo attack may show the group's apparent ability to direct operations beyond yemen's borders
it is thought likely that one or both of the brothers behind the attack in paris visited yemen and received weapons training from aqap and that one may have met with the group's former leader
a u.s. official said the united states was monitoring the violence monday and had <unk> military power nearby to evacuate its embassy on short notice if needed
al sakkaf said gunmen linked to the houthi political movement attacked the presidential palace in a bid to take control of the symbol of power
hadi the president was not in the building and is safe al sakkaf said but government officials were among an unknown number of casualties
houthi rebels claimed responsibility saturday for the abduction of presidential chief of staff ahmed bin mubarak
al sakkaf said monday's dispute began when the government tried to implement a security plan as it feared more <unk> of key staff
but a top houthi official said houthis tried to <unk> with the army and asked for roads to be opened for citizens which led to their people getting attacked
he said they then had to defend themselves
hadi appointed bin mubarak as premier in october but the rebels rejected the nomination
osama sari senior media adviser to the houthi movement in yemen said the houthis had detained bin mubarak as a message to the president
it was because the president wanted to <unk> a new constitution without the approval of the houthis sari said
the abduction came amid increased tensions in the arabian peninsula country after the rise of shiite houthi rebels
houthis swept into the capital last year <unk> battles that left more than three hundred dead in a month
in september houthis signed a ceasefire deal with the government
since then its members have installed themselves in key positions in the government and financial institutions

while <unk> candidacy might end up being more of an issue driven campaign rather than a serious bid for the nation's top office his run might cause some trouble for other candidates in an important early contest
if he does run remember south carolina is an early primary state and that would put a lot of his top donors and operatives in a <unk> because usually they have their choice of candidates to support said <unk>
but if their <unk> guy runs for president they're going to have a choice to make

after black spent about a week in jail a <unk> for the prosecutor's office felt bad about his plight and <unk> his name black later learned
the <unk> contacted some of his associates which is how friends and family members learned what had happened to him
he was quickly transferred to al <unk> prison where he met a syrian in his mid thirty s named kousai
all of those who could speak any english were very supportive and helpful in both the prison and the jail black recalled but kousai made the most <unk> effort
well educated he had a <unk> degree in business administration from florida state university and spoke <unk> english
black called him the cell <unk> <unk> mother
he was always trying to help and <unk> the needs of the prisoners who came from countries such as oman yemen nigeria and egypt all of them foreign workers

in one act of <unk> kousai was <unk> with his wife on the prison phone and asked black if there was anyone he wanted to contact
<unk> wife called <unk> daughter on her cell phone and connected the two on the same phone line
it was the first time that black had been able to talk to someone outside of the prison or jail
his family finally knew first hand where he was and what had happened to him
as the weeks dragged on black became <unk> in prison life
he walked the cell block <unk> to pass time often <unk> <unk> episodes of m a s <unk> and <unk> to <unk> his spirits
he and the other prisoners told jokes or talked about funny movies to help <unk> humor in their otherwise serious world

the picture appeared on <unk> instagram feed on january eleven
it shows <unk> smiling with <unk> miss <unk> and miss japan in miami where the miss universe pageant will take place on sunday
good morning from us
reads the caption
the image <unk> a wide ranging debate in the comments of the picture about the ongoing conflict between israel and much of the arab world
officially israel and lebanon are still at war even though there have been no large scale <unk> on the border since two thousand and six
travel between them by citizens of the two countries is prohibited
the miss universe organization defended the picture saying it was unfortunate that the picture has been perceived in a negative light
at an event with one of our <unk> partners miss universe lebanon and miss universe israel <unk> ended up in an <unk> photo together which was then posted on instagram the organization said in a statement to cnn
it is unfortunate to know a photo of four smiling women from different parts of the world working together at an event could be <unk> as anything other than what it is a celebration of universal friendship which the miss universe pageant is all about
<unk> addressed the controversy on saturday on social media sharing what she called the truth behind the photo
she also posted the same photo on her instagram account with miss israel <unk> out
from the start of pageant <unk> <unk> said she was very cautious to avoid being in any photo or communication with miss israel
as she explains it she was posing for a photo with miss japan and miss <unk> when suddenly miss israel jumped in took a selfie and put it on her social media she said
<unk> <unk> in sunday after a website posted an article with the headline miss lebanon in trouble
she took a <unk> of the article and <unk> it it doesn't surprise me but it still makes me sad and posted it on her social media accounts
too bad you can not put the <unk> out of the game only for three weeks of an experience of a lifetime that we can meet girls from around the world and also from the neighboring country
comments on her original photo echoed the sentiment
as a lebanese i really don't see anything wrong with this picture
it's time we promote peace over violence as the latter has gotten us no where
and if you really <unk> <unk> discuss politics it surely shouldn't be under the picture of four beautiful <unk> who have nothing to do with your b <unk> good luck <unk>
it's not the first time beauty <unk> have been caught up in political controversy
according to multiple news reports former miss lebanon <unk> <unk> pulled out of miss universe two thousand and two because she did not want to share the stage with miss israel amid tensions in the middle east
the miss universe pageant has always been a celebration of different cultures welcoming women from all around the globe
it provides an opportunity for the participants to see just how much they have in common the organization said
with eighty eight women from around the world coming together for the miss universe pageant new <unk> are <unk> and we hope that these relationships can make <unk> for change in the future
but that's not the way cubans see things
they regard many <unk> of daily life as falling into a gray area open to their own <unk> interpretation at least until the authorities catch up with them
that was the case when i decided to join ninety three year old <unk> torrente on a trip to the outskirts of havana to a cockfighting arena
on paper this was a privately operated underground venue <unk> and <unk> by the cuban state
for a <unk> <unk> event it was clear plenty of people seemed to know about it
as i picked my way down a short dirt track and past a couple of <unk> <unk> i heard voices shouting and what sounded like scores of <unk> <unk>
in front of a metal gate two men <unk> my way
there's a problem they said
i <unk> they were referring to the camera gear in my hands or the fact i was a <unk>
entrance <unk> will cost you seventy five <unk> they said
that's the equivalent of about three u.s. dollars more than half a week's <unk> for a cuban state worker
but for me it was the price of passage into the <unk> world of many ordinary cubans where rules are never quite what they seem
on the other side of the gate one of the first people i ran into was the event <unk>
not allowed but not really forbidden
well this definitely isn't <unk> but i don't really think it's forbidden he said <unk> and explaining he'd been staging <unk> every saturday for the last fourteen years
many fans of the <unk> had told me stories of how they had been at fights that had been raided by the police and were forced to run away to avoid arrest
when i asked this <unk> how he had managed to <unk> sanctions for so long he <unk> and placed two fingers on his shoulder a <unk> he was <unk> a contact in the security services to turn a blind eye
talking about official corruption however is highly <unk> upon as well as bad for his business so i made my way <unk> without further questions
the cockpit and small <unk> stands were made of <unk> <unk> of <unk> metal
not <unk> but highly effective
about two hundred men and a handful of women and children were <unk> to the bars <unk> on their <unk> <unk> as it <unk> and <unk> in a <unk> circle
my guide for the day <unk> torrente who lives miles away in <unk> old havana quickly filled me in on tactics
it's part technique and part luck he said
in fact it's mostly luck
it's a bit like life itself
if you were born to win then you'll win
but if you were born to lose it doesn't matter how good you are you'll end up like this he said <unk> his arm and <unk> the death of a <unk>
i'd met torrente a few days earlier as i searched for a <unk> shop
the <unk> was closed but torrente sat nearby <unk> the <unk> <unk> off one of the four fighting <unk> he is currently <unk>
his birds are still too young and too <unk>
he's feeding them <unk> and putting them on a strict training routine
but on the saturday afternoon i joined him he had no direct stake in the fights
cockfighting itself may be somewhat a gray area the letter of the law appears to permit a handful state run events at venues where health and safety measures are <unk> but bans private events like the one i was at
but cuban law seems <unk> in declaring gambling illegal
prior to fidel <unk> one thousand nine hundred and fifty nine revolution the u.s. <unk> controlled <unk> and prostitution in cuba
thanks to the income from those <unk> the <unk> also had a say in how government was run
the <unk> law book somehow seemed to have been <unk> here on the outskirts of havana
<unk> shouted across the arena and <unk> hand signs at one another offering odds to any takers
when one <unk> collapsed in a bloodied <unk> and the other was <unk> <unk> small <unk> of <unk> changed hands
on the <unk> of the <unk> a man running a <unk> game on a green <unk> table invited me take to a photo
he quickly <unk> the offer when i reminded him <unk> games and gambling were illegal
you can't get rid of cockfighting it's part of cuban culture
it's the sport of the common people one prize <unk> owner who gave him name as <unk> told me
beyond the question of <unk> it's clear cockfighting is a passion for some in cuba like in other parts of latin america
torrente told me he grew up in western cuba alongside a cockpit
ever since i was born there was a cockfighting arena near my house
the <unk> would come on their horse to the fights
i used to love that he said
<unk> father died when he was just a boy
his uncle <unk> paid for his <unk>
his uncle left cuba in the early one thousand nine hundred and twenty s for new york and worked as a traveling <unk> <unk>
uncle <unk> used to send a check back to <unk> mother every month
and when torrente was twelve in the early one thousand nine hundred and thirty s his uncle sent for him and put him into school in new york
by his own admission torrente learned nothing and was an <unk> student
he remembers swimming in the <unk> river when he should have been in class
his uncle sent him back to havana after a year
they told my uncle not to waste any more of his money on my education
it wasn't worth it torrente explained
by the time the cuban revolution came torrente says his uncle had <unk> six or seven buildings in havana as an investment
he had also <unk> a <unk> shop to torrente who took up the trade
but castro and his rebels <unk> wealthy <unk> <unk> like <unk> uncle <unk> of his property and <unk> some of it among <unk> poorest
torrente was left with a single apartment where he's lived for the last sixty years
three of his own children decided to leave cuba and head to the united states
but torrente says he refused to go for a very simple reason
cockfighting was illegal in the united states
i didn't want to go he said
when it <unk> down to it i think life <unk> around just three things
women cockfighting and <unk> he said
in cuba he had all three
torrente is clearly no fan of cuba's <unk> system
it seemed that when the revolution took place everything was going to change and get better
but for me and many others it didn't
they took away my <unk> shop
they took my <unk> buildings
now i get just nine dollar <unk> a month he said
then he <unk> placed his index finger on the tip of his <unk>
but you can't speak too much about that he said <unk> the <unk> of an older generations of cubans not to openly voice criticism of the government to strangers
with u.s. president barack obama's december announcement to work towards <unk> of ties with an old cold war <unk> torrente is hopeful
he says he doubts he will live to see the cuban government returning the property it <unk> from his uncle
but the <unk> of trade and travel restrictions will make it easier for his three children and grandchildren to come back and forth to visit from florida
the changes will also allow his relatives if they can afford it to send higher value <unk> to fund him in his retirement
funding his retirement of course means funding his <unk> passion for fighting <unk>
on sunny days torrente places his four <unk> <unk> in separate small <unk> outside on the sidewalk
and while he is surely hoping for a <unk> in u.s. cuba relations he's <unk> his biggest hope for a young <unk> he calls painted indian
torrente sets him on a <unk> kitchen scale holds up three fingers and says
he weighs three pounds
maybe in six months he'll be ready
i think he's going to be a great fighter
gen. mohammed ali <unk> was killed in the same sunday airstrike that killed six others during a field inspection in quneitra a hezbollah statement said

jihad <unk> the son of <unk> <unk> was born in one thousand nine hundred and eighty nine
his father was <unk> in syria in two thousand and eight
according to a statement from the lebanon based militant group a group was doing a field inspection in quneitra when a helicopter opened fire
most of those released saturday were children and the elderly said <unk> <unk> the kurdistan democratic party leader
once they were freed they walked up to a peshmerga checkpoint southwest of the city of kirkuk according to <unk>
they are now under the care of kurdish authorities
yazidis are among iraq's <unk> minorities
they are of kurdish descent and their religion is considered a pre islamic <unk> that draws from christianity judaism and <unk>
one of the oldest religious communities in the world they have long suffered persecution with many muslims referring to them as <unk> <unk>
the militant group isis which calls itself the islamic state <unk> into iraq's north last year forcing hundreds of thousands of minorities from their homes
the u.s. state department estimates that five hundred thousand yazidis live in northern iraq <unk> for less than one percents of the country's population
that means average land and sea temperatures worldwide have never been <unk> in modern times according to the national <unk> and atmospheric administration and the national <unk> and space administration
this isn't about whether we believe in science
it's about whether we believe the <unk>
in fact the sixteen hottest years on record have all occurred since one thousand nine hundred and ninety seven the new data confirm contributing to widening <unk> rising seas <unk> drought <unk> storms <unk> heat and other climate change <unk> reaching from the <unk> african village to our own <unk>
here in the united states arizona <unk> <unk> and california all wrapped up their hottest years on record
california remains <unk> in the grip of a three year drought its worst in centuries
the northeast is still <unk> from <unk> <unk>
and that was just one of the climate related disasters that cost this country an estimated one hundred and thirty nine billion dollar in <unk> in two thousand and twelve alone
above and beyond the economic costs climate change has created a widening humanitarian crisis noted by spiritual leaders around the world
for example pope francis is expected to publish an <unk> on the state of the world's environment <unk> out climate change as an urgent challenge to global <unk>
it's reported that he'll call on people of all faiths to embrace our obligation to protect future generations from this grave and gathering <unk>
president obama has <unk> on the single greatest u.s. effort yet to combat this growing <unk> by reducing the dangerous carbon pollution that's driving climate chaos
he has directed the environmental protection agency to put in place the first limits on carbon pollution from the power plants that account for about forty percents of the u.s. carbon <unk>
under the president's clean power plan we'll cut carbon emissions from our power plants twenty six percents by two thousand and twenty and thirty percents by two thousand and thirty
we can do better than that and we should
the president's plan puts us on the right track
since last summer <unk> officials have been hard at work <unk> with their state counterparts public service <unk> power companies and other <unk> <unk> to come up with <unk> made plans to hit the targets in the most cost effective way
some power companies are already well on their way investing in <unk> so we can do more with less waste getting more power from the wind and sun <unk> up dirty power plants or some combination of the three
even as we as a nation begin to make progress though some coal gas and oil companies and their allies on <unk> hill want to turn us back around
republican leaders in the congress have pledged to lead <unk> efforts meant to keep the <unk> from cutting carbon pollution
the republican leaders aren't offering answers of their own mind you
they just want to block any action that could help us address the problem of climate change
it's part of the big <unk> agenda they've vowed to press putting fossil fuel <unk> first and putting the rest of us at risk
we have a responsibility in this country to stand up and speak out for what matters most
that's the essence of american democracy
it's part of what makes us exceptional
it's part of what makes us great
we just finished worldwide the hottest year on record
those are facts no amount of climate change denial can <unk>
we have a choice in this country
we can continue to feed climate disaster by <unk> our future in the fossil fuels of the past or we can protect future generations from the <unk> of climate change by investing in the clean energy solutions of tomorrow

hadi appointed bin mubarak premier back in october but the rebels rejected the nomination
a senior media adviser to the houthi movement in yemen osama sari told cnn that the presidential chief of staff had been detained by the houthis as a message to the president

the eleven year old mystery of what happened to the uk sponsored beagle two mars lander on its trip to the red planet's surface appeared to be mostly <unk> friday with the announcement the craft had been spotted in high resolution nasa images taken from orbit
the lander <unk> with devices to look for signs of life on mars never <unk> home after <unk> a ride aboard the european space agency's mars express <unk> and <unk> into the atmosphere on december twenty five two thousand and three
the images appear to show that the <unk> solar <unk> didn't fully open after landing preventing the craft from getting power and <unk> the <unk> it would have used to communicate with controllers on earth according to the space agency
while the reasons for that failure remain unknown the discovery of the lander helps solve one of the most <unk> <unk> in <unk> exploration said mark <unk> a beagle two team member from the university of <unk>
every christmas day since two thousand and three i have wondered what happened to beagle two he said adding that he'd almost given up hope of ever knowing what had come of the lander
the highly complex entry descent and landing sequence seems to have worked <unk> and only during the final <unk> of <unk> did beagle two unfortunately run into problems he said
the lander which is less than two meters across when fully deployed was first spotted in the nasa images by michael <unk> of <unk> germany a former member of the european space agency's mars express operations team the uk space agency said
<unk> is among a group of beagle two team members who have spent years <unk> through images from nasa's <unk> camera which is on the agency's mars <unk> <unk> looking for signs of the missing craft the agency said
he found it in an area near the planned landing zone an impact <unk> called <unk> <unk> close to the <unk> <unk>
the <unk> images appear to show the lander resting on the surface its solar <unk> only partially deployed
the <unk> rear cover and <unk> are nearby
had the lander deployed properly a <unk> of onboard tools would have been used to <unk> rocks soil and atmosphere for signs of life
the lander the first european craft sent to the <unk> surface was named after the <unk> beagle the ship that carried charles <unk> on a <unk> five year scientific survey
while its <unk> resulted in no such <unk> david <unk> chief executive of the uk space agency said the discovery proves the beagle two had its <unk>
the history of space exploration is marked by both success and failure he said

in a statement friday the court's top prosecutor said the decision follows the palestinians signing of the rome <unk>
in doing so they officially become <unk> members on april one giving the court <unk> over alleged crimes in palestinian territories
while a preliminary examination is not a formal investigation it allows the court to review evidence and determine whether to investigate suspects on both sides
there are no <unk> provided in the rome <unk> for a decision on a preliminary examination the <unk> said in a statement
israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu described the inquiry as an outrage saying the court is <unk> its boundaries
the palestinian authority is not a country and therefore it is not the court's place also according to its own rules to carry out an examination like this netanyahu told the jerusalem post
the united states also said it strongly <unk> with the court's decision
as we have said repeatedly we do not believe that palestine is a state and therefore we do not believe that it is eligible to join the <unk> the state department said in a statement
it urged the <unk> sides to resolve their differences through direct negotiations
we will continue to oppose actions against israel at the <unk> as <unk> to the cause of peace it said
but the <unk> <unk> to <unk> with the definition of a state for its purposes and refers to the territories as palestine
the office considers that since palestine was granted <unk> state status in the un by the <unk> it must be considered a state for the purposes of <unk> to the rome <unk> it said in a statement

raif badawi convicted on charges that included insulting islam had been scheduled to receive the second of twenty sentenced <unk> after friday prayers in jeddah
he received the first flogging on january nine
a doctor who examined him before the scheduled flogging determined that his wounds had not yet <unk> and that the flogging should be delayed human rights group amnesty international said
the doctor concluded that the wounds had not yet <unk> properly and that he would not be able to <unk> another round of lashes at this time amnesty international said in a statement
badawi's wife <unk> <unk> said from her home in canada that she expects the <unk> to resume next friday
one of his friends ali <unk> said from toronto that the delay is definitely encouraging
none of us are completely <unk> he told cnn's new day
this is the saudi regime he said
we don't know what's going to happen from here <unk> but it's definitely a step in the right direction
rights groups and others including the u.s. state department have called for saudi arabia to call off the <unk> the first of which appeared to be captured on unverified cell phone video <unk> to youtube
not only does this <unk> on health grounds expose the <unk> brutality of this punishment it <unk> its outrageous <unk> said said <unk> amnesty international's deputy middle east and north africa program director
badawi was convicted in two thousand and fourteen and sentenced to ten years in prison and one thousand lashes after creating an online forum in two thousand and eight that his wife says was meant to encourage discussion about faith
when more than two hundred girls were in april two thousand and fourteen kidnapped by boko haram terrorists from their school in chibok the international community rallied around nigeria
from michelle obama to <unk> keys to malala yousafzai <unk> from across the globe lent their voices to the <unk> social media campaign
this response <unk> greatly to the relative <unk> which followed what has been described by amnesty international as boko haram's deadliest attack the massacre of up to two thousand mostly women and children in baga town of northeast nigeria last week
at about the same time that the baga <unk> was making headlines around the world the international community was rallying around france in support against the terrorist attacks on the charlie hebdo newspaper offices in paris giving rise to the <unk> social media campaign
a <unk> <unk> social media campaign has failed to gain much <unk>
the <unk> <unk> points out that a man can not expect you to both <unk> a wife for him and then buy the new couple a bed on which to sleep
similarly a country is expected to take responsibility and set sail with the winds of global support
france's president francois hollande was addressing the world's media and showing leadership within minutes of the attack
his government's efforts to hunt down the terrorists were broadcast for all the world to see
nigeria's president jonathan on the other hand waited two weeks before even offering a word on the chibok kidnappings
so far he has said nothing about baga
however president jonathan has issued a statement condemning the paris attacks
perhaps it is not that the nigerian government does not care about its own people
perhaps they simply want to spare us the <unk> of their public statements and <unk>
the perpetrators of this <unk> act shall be brought to book
no stone shall be left <unk>
god will punish them and their families
but who cares about words and worn out <unk>
action is what the nigerian people need
one year on the fact remains that despite predictions that they would be released <unk> the more than two hundred missing girls have still not been found
the boko haram perpetrators rather than <unk> under the fire of the nigerian armed forces have become <unk>
more women and girls have been kidnapped
boys have been kidnapped
communities in the northeast of nigeria are being raided and <unk> on an almost weekly basis
it is also possible that the nigerian government's <unk> is being <unk> as <unk> or <unk>
maybe they do not believe that things are as bad as is being widely reported by the international media
last year president <unk> wife patience openly <unk> the <unk> of the missing girls report
this week the nigerian defense ministry insisted that fewer than one hundred and fifty lives were lost in the baga attack as opposed to amnesty international's quoted two thousand
some <unk> i've <unk> to have also expressed their doubts about the two thousand figure
they believe that similar to the world <unk> assertion that more than sixty seven percents of <unk> are living in poverty the baga reports are all part of the international <unk> grand conspiracy to <unk> nigeria to make our country look bad
they insist that the international media in their quest to <unk> bad news from africa have simply <unk> on to an unverified casualty figure
unfortunately the nigerian media <unk> not part of this grand international conspiracy are unable to provide us with enough alternative information
they are too busy covering the <unk> for the <unk> elections scheduled to take place in february
political rallies are <unk> live on local tv and radio stations for hours every day
photographs of <unk> politicians are <unk> on newspaper front pages every morning their latest <unk> and promises <unk> all the headlines
current affairs programs and opinion pages are consumed with the <unk> or <unk> of either president jonathan or his main <unk> at the polls general <unk> <unk>
baga and other such will clearly have to take a back seat until after the elections
nevertheless the ongoing carnage in nigeria's northeast will definitely be a <unk> factor in the outcome of the february elections
a recent snap poll by nigeria's <unk> identified security as one of the key issues that <unk> want their president to focus on in two thousand and fifteen
i suspect that those <unk> who believe the relatively popular theory in certain ethnic <unk> that the rise in boko haram attacks are being <unk> by unknown forces who want president jonathan out by all means will vote to keep him in just to prove a point to his enemies that their vicious efforts did not work
others who feel that jonathan is simply <unk> and <unk> of handling the crisis will probably vote <unk>
whatever happens at the polls nigeria has to at some point face the boko haram issue <unk> even after the international media <unk> around the group's latest attacks has died down as it surely will
according to a recent study shipping accounts for around three percents of global co two emissions
not surprising when you consider that the engines of the world's estimated ninety thousand cargo ships are in use twenty four hours a day while traveling
<unk> <unk> for container ships powered by alternative energy range from <unk> powered <unk> to banks of <unk> metal <unk>
even though most are still on the drawing board one concept is starting to be viewed seriously by the shipping industry
called the vindskip the norwegian design uses the high sides of its container ships as <unk> turning the whole vessel into a wind assisted <unk>
designed by lade as the oslo based company says the <unk> merchant ship which would still have a <unk> natural gas powered engine could achieve fuel savings of sixty percents and reduce emissions by eighty percents
it's the <unk> of <unk> lade who used his skills as a speed <unk> to develop his <unk> design
he says the <unk> container ship works more like an airplane than a conventional sailing ship
he said
in the era of christopher <unk> for example he would have used what became known as trade winds but his ship was quite different from the vindskip because he would have been sailing with the wind he couldn't sail into the wind
vindskip can almost sail into the wind
in this way it's more like an airplane
it uses apparent wind or the sail wind to generate pull in much the same way that an airplane will take off when it <unk> a certain speed
the ship would be able to point as high as eighteen degrees into the wind the vacuum created on the lee side of the vessel enough to <unk> the ship forward
critical to the design is computer software being developed by germany's <unk> center for maritime logistics and services which <unk> the <unk> sailing route based on the weather and <unk> winds
with this software you <unk> when you want to leave and when you want to arrive the weather forecast is <unk> into the program and then it <unk> the best route lade said
this would be <unk> updated every day
at each <unk> it would check with the time arrival and tell the crew whether to speed up using the engines or slow down
it makes it very easy for the crew
the <unk> in the software also <unk> the best angle to the wind to gain the maximum performance from the design
with our weather <unk> module the best route can be <unk> in order to <unk> as little fuel as possible
as a result costs are reduced
after all bunker <unk> account for the largest part of the total costs in the shipping industry said <unk> <unk> researcher at <unk> in <unk>
changes to regulations in the <unk> content of marine heavy fuels are set to make the price of bunker fuel typically among the <unk> and <unk> of fuels in the <unk> process more expensive
<unk> traditionally <unk> <unk> <unk> bunker fuels because they were cheap with large ships having the space to transport the pre <unk> necessary to make the fuel <unk>
but all that is about to change
current international regulations <unk> <unk> content at three point five percents but this is expected to drop to zero point five percents by two thousand and twenty
this makes things quite dramatic said lade
there are not many good solutions to this
at the moment they can wash the <unk> with <unk> but on big ships this is very complex and very expensive
this is where the vindskip comes in due to the low fuel <unk> it can run on <unk> which means there is no <unk> at all
one of <unk> biggest <unk> <unk> has already entered the project on a technical basis and while lade is quietly confident the world's first vindskip will slip into the water by two thousand and nineteen he says the global shipping industry had been slow to respond to his design
the big driving force in the vindskip project will be these new regulations on <unk> levels lade said
the big problem with <unk> is that it <unk> the sea and this means that <unk> and <unk> can't form their shells said lade adding that <unk> was <unk> the entire marine ecosystem
it's very bad
something has to be done it can't go on this way
the <unk> shipping line <unk> told cnn that it was pursuing innovations in energy <unk> as a solution in the here and now
in general we do not believe that wind assisted designs will play any significant role within the container shipping industry in the foreseeable future said <unk> head of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
the technology remains <unk> at both commercial and operational scale
she said that <unk> was developing its <unk> e vessels which used ultra long stroke engines efficient vessel shape and advanced waste heat recovery systems to improve co two <unk> by fifty percents per container
if you look at the technology already on board our vessels today it's remarkable just how far we've come she said
the executions were announced thursday by indonesia's recently appointed attorney general <unk> <unk> who said in a statement that <unk> for the executions were almost complete
he said the executions had been scheduled after <unk> for clemency to indonesian president <unk> widodo were rejected late last month
widodo had previously told a university audience he planned to reject the sixty four appeals for clemency he had received from drug <unk> on death row

human rights groups have slammed the executions calling for them to be stopped
<unk> rising crime rates is a legitimate goal of president <unk> administration but the death penalty is not the answer and does not work as a <unk> to crime said <unk> abbott amnesty international's research director for southeast asia and the pacific
<unk> <unk> deputy director of human rights <unk> asia division accused indonesia of double standards in <unk> to prevent the execution of its nationals overseas but refusing requests by the brazilian government to <unk> moreira to serve out his sentence in his home country
indonesia which has extremely strict drug laws carries out executions by firing squad
the country resumed executions in two thousand and thirteen after a four year break but no executions were carried out in two thousand and fourteen
the incident in <unk> a community about ten kilometers northwest of the french capital began at about twelve forty five p.m. and was over two hours later
the gunman might be mentally <unk> according to police in <unk>
police said that they don't know yet whether the incident is related to terrorism
this is a hot topic in france after last week's deadly attacks
a western intelligence source said there could be as many as twenty terrorist sleeper cells of between one hundred and twenty and one hundred and eighty people ready to strike in france germany belgium and the netherlands
the gunman eventually <unk> and the hostages emerged with no injuries according to france <unk> which is part of the country's public <unk> group

there are horror stories obviously <unk> <unk> <unk> vice president told cnn by phone
we find factories that just have no basic idea about hygiene standards
people that handle the food they have no <unk> nothing
<unk> said there was a host of reasons for the <unk>
in some cases laboratory tests found <unk> levels of <unk> antibiotics heavy <unk> bacteria or <unk> that could put consumers at risk
other <unk> included <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and in the case of <unk> adding water to make the fish appear to <unk> more than it does
china has experienced a string of stomach <unk> food <unk> in recent years
the most high profile recent case involved a u.s. owned meat factory operating in china that was accused of selling out of date and <unk> meat to clients including <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> chains
we see awareness growing but we don't see on the ground a concrete improvement yet it will come <unk> said
<unk> said the extremely <unk> nature of china's food chain the country has five hundred thousand food production and <unk> companies seventy percents of which have fewer than ten employees made it very difficult for authorities to control and foreign buyers to understand
companies like <unk> or <unk> are dealing with their suppliers at <unk> length
so they know well the people they communicate with on a daily basis but they don't know what's going on behind the scenes said <unk>
the buyers are focusing their efforts on the people they signed a <unk> with but they should take the extra step and take control of the full supply chain and going as far as the third or fourth level of suppliers
the two suspects who died in the shootout are believed to have fought with isis in syria the source said
another man was captured but hasn't revealed any information
there also was a dire warning
not all the terrorists in the cell have been <unk> up according to the source
belgian police have taken out part of the terror network plotting an attack in belgium but they have not yet taken down every <unk> of it the source said
there is fear others may try to avenge the two men
authorities investigating the aftermath of the raid in which the men were killed found materials used to make bombs including <unk> for the powerful explosive <unk> but the suspected terrorists had yet to <unk> those weapons
they also had grenades
cell members had discussed attacking police in <unk> phone conversations but belgian investigators still did not know what they were intending to target for sure the source said
the discovery of police uniforms after the raid suggested the possibility they may have been trying to gain access to sensitive sites
the source characterized the cell as one with organized structures a logistical support network and links back to syria and iraq
belgium is one of the nations participating in airstrikes in iraq and officials are concerned this plot is isis <unk> to launch attacks on the european countries involved in the military action against their troops in iraq
i think one of the things that's happening is we're seeing something that's surprising me
that is the <unk> of isis philip <unk>
a former cia counterterrorism official and a cnn analyst said
just last summer we were talking about how quickly isis was taking over <unk>
for a terrorist group to turn around in six or eight months and start training people for operations in europe is remarkable
in the raid in verviers a city of about fifty six thousand people police approached three suspects as they carried large <unk> bags outside of a former <unk> that might have been their <unk> a western intelligence source told cnn

besides the two killed seventeen have been arrested in the investigation thirteen in the belgium raids and four others in france including two who were detained while trying to cross from france into italy van der <unk> office said
investigators haven't found any links between the alleged belgium plot and last week's islamist terror attacks that killed seventeen people in paris the prosecutor said
but the belgium raids come amid fears of ongoing terror threats in europe as many as twenty terror cells with one hundred and twenty to one hundred and eighty people may be ready to strike in france germany belgium and the netherlands a western intelligence source told cnn
thursday <unk> raids were a dramatic <unk> in a chain of belgian police investigations into an alleged terror cell that included people who had fought in syria van der sypt said
the u.s. intelligence community knew for weeks of the plot in belgium and was sharing critical information with belgian authorities several u.s. officials told cnn
the officials wouldn't say <unk> what they knew how much they knew and when they knew it
there is concern those details could signal other militants planning other potential attacks

informed journalists share this concern
the climate crisis threatens the survival of our civilization said <unk> prize winner <unk> <unk>
mark <unk> agrees saying that the <unk> of global warming would create <unk> conditions all but certain to end civilization as we know it
these scientists and journalists moreover are worried not only about the distant future but about the condition of the planet for their own children and grandchildren
james <unk> often considered the world's leading climate scientist entitled his book storms of my grandchildren
the threat to civilization comes primarily from the increase of the level of carbon <unk> in the atmosphere due largely to the burning of fossil fuels
before the rise of the industrial age co two <unk> only two hundred and seventy five <unk> of the atmosphere
but it is now above four hundred and rising about two point five <unk> per year
because of the co two increase the planet's average temperature has increased zero point eight five degrees celsius
although this increase may not seem much it has already brought about serious changes
the idea that we will be safe from dangerous climate change if we do not <unk> a temperature rise of two c has been widely accepted
but many informed people have rejected this <unk>
in the opinion of journalist turned activist bill <unk> the one degree we've raised the temperature already has <unk> the arctic so we're <unk> to find out what two will do
his warning is supported by james <unk> who declared that a target of two degrees is actually a <unk> for long term disaster
the burning of coal oil and natural gas has made the planet warmer than it had been since the rise of civilization ten thousand years ago
civilization was made possible by the emergence about twelve thousand years ago of the <unk> <unk> which turned out to be the <unk> zone not too hot not too cold
but now says physicist <unk> <unk> we are <unk> ourselves way out of the <unk>
this <unk> is dangerous because we have no evidence civilization can long survive with significantly higher temperatures
and yet the world is on a <unk> that would lead to an increase of four c in this century
in the opinion of many scientists and the world bank this could happen as early as the two thousand and sixty s
what would a four c world be like
according to <unk> anderson of the <unk> centre for climate change research during new york's summer heat waves the <unk> days would be around ten twelve c <unk> than today's
moreover he has said above an increase of four c only about ten percents of the human population will survive
believe it or not some scientists consider anderson <unk> optimistic
the main reason for <unk> is the fear that the planet's temperature may be close to a <unk> point that would <unk> a low end <unk> greenhouse involving out of control <unk> <unk>
this condition would result says <unk> if all fossil fuels are burned
this result would make most of the planet <unk> by humans
moreover many scientists believe that <unk> global warming could occur much more quickly because the rising temperature caused by co two could release massive amounts of methane which is during its first twenty years eighty six times more powerful than co two
warmer weather <unk> this release from carbon that has been stored in methane <unk> in which enormous amounts of carbon four times as much as that <unk> from fossil fuels since one thousand eight hundred and fifty has been frozen in the <unk> <unk>
and yet now the <unk> temperature is warmer than it had been for one hundred and twenty thousand years in other words more than ten times longer than civilization has <unk>
according to joe <unk> a physicist who created the climate progress website methane release from <unk> <unk> in the arctic is the most dangerous <unk> feedback in the entire carbon cycle
the <unk> feedback works like this
the warmer temperature releases millions of tons of methane which then further raise the temperature which in turn releases more methane
the resulting threat of <unk> global warming may not be merely <unk>
scientists have long been convinced that methane was central to the fastest period of global warming in <unk> history which occurred fifty five million years ago
now a group of scientists have <unk> evidence that methane was also central to the greatest extinction of life thus far
the end <unk> extinction about two hundred and fifty two million years ago
worse yet <unk> it was previously thought that significant amounts of <unk> would not melt <unk> its methane until the planet's temperature has risen several degrees celsius recent studies indicate that a rise of one point five degrees would be enough to start the <unk>
what can be done then
given the failure of political leaders to deal with the co two problem it is now too late to prevent terrible developments
but it may just may be possible to keep global warming from bringing about the destruction of civilization
to have a chance we must as <unk> says do everything possible to keep climate close to the <unk> range which means <unk> the whole world to replace dirty energy with clean as soon as possible

<unk> el <unk> a writer with charlie hebdo said the cover means the magazine's journalists were <unk> the extremists for the killings
but the cover could also be interpreted as mohammed saying he <unk> the cartoonists in a way the terrorists obviously did not
but the cartoons are somewhat <unk>
as middle east analyst juan cole has argued they were just an excuse for islamic <unk> to further <unk> and exploit the perceived gulf between islam and the west
cole <unk> al qaeda wants to mentally <unk> french muslims but faces a wall of <unk>
but if it can get non muslim french to be <unk> to ethnic muslims on the grounds that they are muslims it can start creating a common political identity around <unk> against discrimination
enter the cartoons
this is why it is <unk> that political voices around the world especially conservatives have argued that we must show our support for charlie hebdo and free speech by <unk> the magazine's offensive cartoons
remember this is a publication few outside france had heard of before it was targeted and even fewer had read and <unk> one that many would have taken offense at in a different context
in fact in a line of thinking best <unk> by new york times columnist and cnn <unk> <unk> <unk> the violent reaction to charlie hebdo's offensive cartoons not only <unk> but also somehow demands that we not only continue but also <unk> up that offense as a form of protest
if a large enough group of <unk> is willing to kill you for saying something then it's something that almost certainly needs to be said wrote <unk>
in other words the violent reaction to something offensive not only <unk> <unk> the offense in the first place but <unk> its rationale going forward
some have indeed argued that because some radical islamists resort to violence it <unk> not only broad offenses and <unk> of the entire religion but also thinking of such <unk> against islam as different from those directed at judaism or christianity
this <unk> for example mass <unk> <unk> <unk> who left a one thousand five hundred page <unk> <unk> himself one hundred percents a christian and advancing his vision of a <unk> christian europe
in two thousand and eleven <unk> killed seventy seven people in norway
does that attack justify blasphemy against christianity and make it <unk> on all of us to increase such blasphemy as a form of protest
the likely response that violence inspired by christianity or judaism is somehow an exception while violence inspired by islam is a rule i s merely a way of <unk> in <unk> and in <unk> <unk> against a group one has already decided to hate
as adam <unk> at the london review of books has noted right wing <unk> in france and europe more <unk> share an organizing principle with jihadists
that there is an <unk> war between europe and islam
blanket <unk> of the whole of islam based on the acts of <unk> help feed the <unk>
so do cartoons that <unk> the prophet mohammed
though it's <unk> to demand all muslims apologize or account for the acts of radicals within their faith since the paris attacks such demands have been made and plenty of moderate muslims have spoken out
and yet perhaps part of the reason we don't hear enough from these voices is that they simply don't fit the narrative fueled by the <unk> in islam and the west and <unk> covered by the <unk> loving media
this would also explain why the media and the west are still <unk> on the slaying of seventeen people in france and paying <unk> less attention to as many as two thousand people killed in nigeria by boko haram
it falls outside the us versus them frame and is further evidence that as protesters in the united states have been <unk> black lives simply aren't treated as though they matter
i unequivocally and <unk> support the right to free speech
<unk> free speech is essential to any democratic and <unk> society
so i support the right of charlie hebdo to print the most <unk> offensive cartoons it can come up with
and to give another example i support the free speech rights of french comedian <unk> m'bala m'bala even though i personally find his anti semitic jokes even more offensive and sick than any of the charlie hebdo cartoons i've seen
still i don't think m'bala m'bala should be facing prosecution by the french government for his speech as he has apparently thirty eight times
<unk> i don't see those rallying <unk> in support of free speech protesting m'bala <unk> repeated prosecution
at the same time many of those <unk> <unk> support for free speech are <unk> and <unk> media outlets that choose not to <unk> the charlie hebdo drawings
the <unk> right wing and fundamentalist islamists want the same thing
to convince muslims and the west that there is an <unk> <unk> between the two
the question for the rest of us the ones who have free speech is whether we feed the <unk> narrative or fight it
a few <unk> islamists have <unk> and <unk> <unk> the world
that's no excuse for anyone to go on <unk> all muslims
to do so only helps advance the terrorists goal

above the arctic circle in the <unk> <unk> of northern norway researchers on the <unk> <unk> are searching for the next generation of antibiotics
in these sea <unk> they hope are new bacteria to become those drugs
if no one finds new antibiotics for common infections what will happen is we will go back to the pre <unk> age in which a simple cut could turn into an infection that becomes deadly said <unk> jaspars
jaspars is the founder of the <unk> project an eu funded initiative to bring research groups together around the world in search of new antibiotics
the world health organization says <unk> resistance is a growing health crisis around the world calling it an increasingly serious threat to global public health that requires action across all government sectors and society
it is not cost effective for <unk> companies to search for new antibiotics
on average it costs a <unk> company more than two billion dollar to bring a new drug to market
in the case of antibiotics the drug is only taken for a short time and could eventually develop resistance
that's why large scale focus has moved away from antibiotics research in the past thirty years
in the meantime bacteria have evolved <unk> and become resistant to many current antibiotics
what was once common treatments are no longer <unk> by using standard antibiotics jaspars said
the key is finding new <unk>
bacteria can't be resistant to a drug if they've never seen anything like it before
extreme <unk> are providing new places to look
in the past bacteria and <unk> have been the main sources for new antibiotics jaspars explained
in fact about seventy percents of our antibiotics still come from nature normally from <unk> samples and soil samples from land
but now by looking at the ocean we hope to find new life forms which give us new <unk> that might be able to treat <unk> infections
that's exactly why anderson and johansen are on board the <unk> <unk>
they are part of jaspars <unk> team and they have identified the <unk> waters of the norwegian arctic as a potential <unk> ground of new bacteria
in this extreme environment the sea <unk> have been forced to adapt over time
they have to <unk> for very different temperatures as compared to other parts of the world anderson said
we think that since they are living in an extreme environment they have developed some extreme <unk> to survive
anderson and johansen take their finds from the bottom of the sea straight to a <unk> lab on the ship
it is critical to begin testing as soon as possible ensuring <unk> of the <unk>
johansen cuts open the <unk> while anderson makes solutions to be <unk> on a <unk> <unk>
in a few weeks bacteria will grow on the <unk> hopefully <unk> <unk> properties
it is a long and <unk> process with no time to waste
it often takes <unk> of a decade for new drugs to be approved
it's a rush against time anderson said
i think we have to speed up the process of trying to find novel antibiotics
at the moment a lot of the antibiotics out there are working in the same way
the early results are promising
several <unk> being tested in norway and at jaspars lab in scotland are showing initial signs of <unk> properties
a good start with a long way to go but jaspars knows the hopeful legacy of the <unk> project and others like is around the world is to <unk> the issue of <unk> resistance
who knows where the next <unk> will be found
perhaps it will be in the <unk> norwegian arctic
it is always very exciting when you get to the stage where you are the first person to see a bacteria said jaspars or the first person to identify the structure of a new <unk> that has the potential at that moment to be a treatment for a difficult disease
some of the world's biggest restaurants are <unk> their brands to other countries some permanently others only temporarily while top <unk> are opening exciting new <unk>

on wednesday al qaeda released a video featuring nasr ibn ali al ansi one of its top commanders in yemen claiming responsibility for the horrific attack last week on the offices of the satirical magazine charlie hebdo
he gave two reasons for the attack
first he claimed it was in revenge for charlie hebdo's printing of cartoons lampooning the prophet mohammed
al ansi then went on to state in much greater detail that the attack was in response to france and the west killing muslims
we will tell you once again
stop <unk> our blood
and then he urged muslims across the world to take <unk> for muslim blood <unk>
well if <unk> muslim blood is the <unk> factor for us muslims to decide who we should take <unk> against then al ansi and others in al qaeda should immediately go into hiding
simply put al qaeda has been <unk> muslims for years
islamic <unk> doctors nurses women children <unk>
you name any type of muslim and al qaeda has <unk> them
in fact a report released in two thousand and nine by the combating terrorism center at west point documented the people killed by al qaeda between two thousand and four and two thousand and eight
it found that only twelve percents of the victims of al qaeda were westerners
that suggests that al qaeda has killed seven times as many muslims as non muslims
and these attacks were just the ones for which al qaeda had publicly claimed responsibility
and since that report al qaeda in yemen has engaged in even more vicious attacks on muslims
keep in mind that ninety nine percents of the population of yemen is muslim so with a few <unk> virtually every person the group kills there is a muslim
in december two thousand and fourteen for example an al qaeda bomb killed fifteen children and ten adults when the bus they were on was blown up by an al qaeda car bomb intended for a competing militia leader in the area
this attack followed another in which al qaeda sent a suicide bomber into a crowd of protesters in the nation's capital killing forty seven people and injuring one hundred and forty
and back in december two thousand and thirteen al qaeda launched an attack on a hospital killing fifty two people and wounding one hundred and sixty seven with two car bombs before <unk> shooting patients and doctors in the hospital
the list goes on but al qaeda is not alone in killing muslims who stand in its way
isis has done the same in iraq and syria
a u.n. report released late last year found that isis had killed thousands of muslims both sunni and shia between july and september of that year
this includes the slayings of three nurses in mosul iraq because they refused to provide medical care to isis fighters
isis also killed numerous sunni <unk> for refusing to <unk> allegiance to isis and beheaded another sunni leader for refusing to support the group
and the reality is that that's truly what al qaeda and isis are about
they are not about the concept of submit to islam or die as some have claimed
it's submit to isis al qaeda or die
both organizations clearly don't care how many muslims they kill
yet at the same time they will both claim they are carrying out their actions in the name of islam
in fact al ansi stated in wednesday's video that the terrorist brothers who carried out the attack on the charlie hebdo officers were two heroes of islam
he couldn't be more wrong
but that isn't to say there weren't heroes of islam in paris that day it's just that they are two quite different people
ahmed merabet was the french police officer shot in cold blood while lying on the sidewalk by the so called heroes of islam
as his brother stated at a press conference merabet was a proud muslim who gave his life defending french values of liberty equality and <unk>
and there was lassana bathily the muslim employee at the kosher <unk> in paris who reportedly saved the lives of seven jewish <unk> by helping them hide when amedy coulibaly entered the store with guns <unk>
bathily's actions <unk> the famous <unk> verse whoever <unk> one it is as if he had saved <unk> entirely
obviously calling out the hypocrisy of al qaeda and isis won't change these organizations goals they will continue to <unk> islam as cover for their political ambitions because it helps them <unk> new recruits and raise funds which are vital for their continued existence
but maybe if their hypocrisy is consistently laid bare then it might help all understand the true motivation of these terrorist groups and hopefully even give <unk> to any muslims thinking of joining their un islamic cause
after all al qaeda and isis aren't interested in <unk> the principles of islam
they are focused only on power however many muslim lives they take
it wasn't immediately clear why the cia <unk> posted the quote which appeared in <unk> <unk> and according to google translate means
i wrote the novel in order for it to be published and read and it remains my only desire <unk>
an internet search also didn't clear up the origin of the quote or whether it came from <unk> or not
all of washington has been on high alert for twitter <unk> after the account associated with the military's u.s. central command <unk> was hacked on monday apparently by <unk> of isis
but in this case it was just a <unk> by cia which a thirty two minutes later posted cia's book program kept a critical mass of <unk> in the soviet <unk> informed <unk> the values <unk> of the free world
<unk>
read more from the <unk> center about the cia's <unk> cold war book program
the cia as an agency is notoriously secret but the social media team behind cia has shown itself to have a sense of humor often making jokes about <unk> and engaging with tweets about items from the cia's <unk> of spy <unk> and documents
for instance back in july they tweeted no we don't know where <unk> is
<unk>
they haven't yet tweeted quite as much about more timely matters like the senate intelligence committee's report on the bush era torture practices by the cia
although they did put out this fact <unk> on the torture program back in december
do you think your husband is dead
her mouth <unk> <unk> her young face tears <unk> in her already <unk> eyes
i don't know
i pray to god to give him another chance she finally manages to <unk>
her sadness is heavy and blankets both of us
she tells me she has three children and they last saw their father four months ago when he went back to his army unit on the front line in nigeria's battle with the radical islamist extremist group boko haram
his friends last saw him bloodied and shooting as boko haram fighters advanced and they all fled
if all this wasn't trauma enough the young woman says the army has <unk> her too
they didn't tell me anything they still haven't told me what happened and they didn't pay me anything and no one is feeding us in the barracks she said
we are in northern nigeria a few hours drive north of the capital where the mostly muslim north <unk> the mostly christian south
just last month a double suicide bombing killed twelve people in a busy central market in the region
driving northeast of here toward the borders with chad cameroon and niger puts you in the heart of boko haram territory a land mass the size of belgium
so it's no surprise that the area is home to many thousands of troops and as i am finding out it's also the backdrop of many more heart wrenching stories
a mile or so from his base i meet a soldier on a remote <unk> hill
he is a veteran of african union and united nations <unk> missions in liberia and sudan a professional soldier
we sit on plastic chairs as he tells me his story
he too was left on the battlefield by his <unk> as they fled for safety in the face of a boko haram attack
he doesn't blame them
the major problem the soldiers have is they don't have the equipment to fight he says
boko haram has anti aircraft guns which he says are accurate up to three quarters of a mile
all the nigerian military has he says are ak forty seven small machine guns accurate up to a few hundred meters
often the nigerian soldiers are given only sixty bullets each so they quickly run out
boko haram he says has large supplies of ammunition and more fighters
although the nigerian soldiers do win some fights he says they are regularly forced to turn tail and run for their lives by the sheer <unk> of gunfire from boko haram fighters
it took him three days on foot alone to get back to his base seventy kilometers away
when he arrived his wife told him to quit the army but his <unk> were only just beginning
army <unk> refused to pay the two hundred dollar for medicine to treat his injuries
<unk> in the army is sinking he says
that night i meet a young officer who like the other soldier is not authorized to talk to me
our conversation is held in a <unk> in a tiny <unk> <unk> that sells <unk> and <unk> drinks at a <unk> on the outskirts of a town
corruption he tells me is the root of the nigerian military's problem
not just the <unk>
everybody in the country wants to get rich by any means necessary he says
the soldiers don't ever benefit from the billions allocated to the defense budget he explains
he even had to buy his own uniform
the <unk> <unk> is actually very low very low because we are not issued a uniform we buy the uniforms ourselves he explained
the other soldier i met on the hill told me this too
when they go into battle no one has the same uniform so when they run from boko haram it's chaos
they don't know who is friend or <unk> whom to shoot and whom to help
most soldiers live in fear the young officer tells me
a fear of what will happen to them and how long they can survive in this battle he says
the worrying doesn't stop there
they see enough war <unk> on the base to know the grim reality of what can happen to their loved ones if they die
a widow i meet explains
her husband was killed in battle over a year ago she tells me
when my husband died they never called me to tell me that i lost my husband she says
they buried him without <unk> me
she gets no army <unk> and she says there are many more like her
they feel abandoned afraid to speak out because they still live in the barracks
government officials tell us they will look into these <unk> that they are working on getting better weapons for the troops
if they do according to the soldiers i met it will easily turn the tide in this war
the pope made the gesture and accompanying remarks while flying from sri lanka to the philippines where he started a five day visit thursday
he didn't mention charlie hebdo the satirical magazine that was targeted by terrorists after it <unk> the prophet mohammed in cartoons something that many muslims find offensive
the paris magazine became a terrorist target after publishing one such cartoon years ago and after last week's attack it placed mohammed on its cover this time showing him crying and holding a sign with the rallying cry je suis charlie french for i am charlie
still even if he didn't explicitly name the publication the pope was clear that he was referring to the general debate over what's happened in france including how people might react if they feel someone made a <unk> to their religious faith
everyone has not only the liberty but also the obligation to say what he thinks to help the common good francis said
however they should not do so if it <unk> people
and if someone does get <unk>
the pope made reference to <unk> <unk> a man who <unk> papal trips and was then standing next to him on the plane
if dr. <unk> a great friend says a <unk> word against my mother then a punch <unk> him francis said
it's normal it's normal
one can not provoke one can not <unk> other people's faith one can not make fun of faith
while making this comment vatican radio reported that the pontiff <unk> with a <unk> punch directed at <unk> an action many journalists interpreted as a joke
notably in the same conversation francis steadfastly <unk> the terrorists killings and the idea that anyone as the france attackers apparently did could <unk> to justify such violence in the name of god
one can not make war kill in the name of one's own religion francis said on his way to the philippines
to kill in the name of god is an <unk>
the vatican later responded to a cnn question about the punch <unk> specifically
in an email vatican spokesman thomas <unk> told cnn that the pope's expression is in no way intended to be interpreted as somehow <unk> last week's violence and he pointed out that the pope has spoken out clearly against the terror and violence that occurred in paris and in other parts of the world
the pope's words about dr. <unk> were spoken <unk> and in friendly <unk> manner among colleagues and friends <unk> said thursday
his response might be similar to something each of us has felt when those <unk> to us are insulted or <unk>
<unk> explained francis remarks as consistent with his free style of speech a <unk> and <unk> approach that has earned him <unk>
such remarks must be taken at face value and not <unk> or <unk> the vatican spokesman said
in fact the pope has been one of the world's most <unk> advocates for peace and against war since taking that position in two thousand and thirteen
and what he said on the manila bound plane doesn't change that according to <unk>
pope francis has not <unk> violence with his words on the flight the spokesman said
a western intelligence source tells cnn that the ongoing terror threat appears to involve up to twenty sleeper cells of between one hundred and twenty to one hundred and eighty people ready to strike in france germany belgium and the netherlands
the source said that european union and middle east intelligence agencies identified an imminent threat to belgium possibly also to the netherlands
a terror cell on the brink of carrying out an attack was the target of a raid thursday that left two suspects dead belgian authorities said
a third suspect was injured and taken into custody in the operation at a building in the eastern city of verviers prosecutor's spokesman <unk> werts told reporters
a senior belgian counterterrorism official told cnn that the alleged terror cell is believed to have received instructions from isis
some members of the cell had traveled to syria and met with isis which plotted the attacks as retaliation for u.s. led airstrikes in syria and iraq the belgian source said
this was in the framework of an operation looking into an operational cell made up of people some of whom coming back from syria werts said
the investigation made it possible to determine that the group was about to carry out major terrorist attacks in belgium <unk>
the operation which authorities said was ongoing added fresh fuel to a fear that's been <unk> for months as thousands of europeans went off to join isis fighters in syria
would they bring the war back with them when they returned home
<unk> hausman was inside his house in verviers when he heard the explosions start
from the window he saw police officers firing assault rifles at a house nearby
he watched smoke rising after another explosion went off
then police entered the house hausman told cnn's <unk> <unk> <unk>
and even though he couldn't see exactly what happened next he heard it
i can hear it
everybody can hear it hausman said
in this little city everybody heard the sound
<unk> gunfire and the sound of glass <unk> echo in a video hausman posted on youtube
the suspects immediately and for long minutes fired using weapons and hand weapons before being <unk> werts said
verviers is about sixty nine miles east southeast of brussels and two hundred miles northeast of paris where terrorist attacks last week heightened <unk> in europe
cnn affiliate <unk> reported that the terrorism investigation in belgium started weeks ago and there has been no connection established with the paris attacks
a western intelligence source said the paris attacks played a role in <unk> the timing of the belgian operation
one reason
the arrest of a belgian arms <unk> suspected of providing weapons to amedy coulibaly the man who attacked a paris kosher supermarket and also pledged allegiance to isis
belgian investigators questioned him and searched his <unk> the source said
through the arms <unk> the investigators got a number of positive hits on suspected extremists already known to authorities
but in the wake of the paris attacks the source said it stepped up the urgency
the trio targeted in the verviers raid had been under surveillance for some time werts said
additional anti terrorism operations are underway in other cities the belgian counterterrorism official said
in recent weeks european security services received indications of an <unk> possibility
that isis may have started <unk> european extremists in syria and iraq to launch terrorist attacks back in their home countries the belgian counterterrorism official said
security agencies in several european countries were intensely investigating several groups of <unk> from syria and iraq the official said including the group that authorities confronted in belgium
the belgian counterterrorism official said indications of isis ordering attacks in europe mark an apparent significant shift by the terrorist group
before the air campaign against it the official said there was little indication isis leaders were directly plotting attacks in the west
instead the group <unk> its project to create an islamic caliphate
the official named france the uk and belgium as countries facing a particular threat
counterterrorism agencies in germany also are on high alert because of the number of fighters who have traveled
several european countries including britain france belgium and the netherlands are participating in the air campaign against isis in iraq
why would isis change <unk>
partly because of increased competition between isis and al qaeda affiliates including the <unk> group in syria to be seen as the standard <unk> of global jihad according to the official
the official said there is also significant concern about <unk> attack plotting against europe
u.s. officials previously told cnn that french al qaeda operative and bomb maker david <unk> was suspected to be talent spotting european jihadis in syria for operations in europe
<unk> was injured in a drone strike in november but is believed to be still alive
last week andrew <unk> the head of britain's security service <unk> five warned a group of core al qaeda terrorists in syria is planning mass casualty attacks against the west an apparent reference to the <unk> group
european officials have been warning for months about the unprecedented challenge posed by returning fighters
more than three thousand europeans have left to fight in syria in recent years
the total number who have returned to europe is estimated to be over five hundred including two hundred and fifty who have returned to the uk almost two hundred to france and about seventy to belgium
several returning isis fighters have already been <unk> in attack plans in europe
in february police in cannes broke up an alleged plot to bomb targets in france by ibrahim <unk> a french algerian extremist who allegedly had just returned from fighting with isis in syria
police said they found almost a kilogram of the high explosive <unk> inside <unk> <unk> in his family's cannes apartment building
<unk> and <unk> were attached to one with <unk> tape as <unk> according to sources briefed on the investigation
<unk> has denied the allegations against him
<unk> <unk> a french algerian isis fighter who allegedly helped guard western hostages in syria before returning to europe allegedly shot and killed four people at a jewish museum in brussels in may
<unk> was arrested in france and <unk> to face trial in belgium
he has denied the charges
in both the cannes and brussels plots investigators believe it is possible the men were acting on their own <unk>
no evidence has been publicly released suggesting isis leadership signed off on the plots
but the worry now is that isis has <unk> toward launching attacks in europe
european officials say all this adds up to an unprecedented terrorist threat in europe
late last year just weeks before the attacks on a satirical magazine jewish grocery and police officers in paris french prime minister manuel valls said france had never faced a greater terrorist threat
isis runs large training facilities in syria has deep financial pockets and access to thousands of potential european recruits
now the french government is helping out bathily by making him a citizen
the malian <unk> citizenship application which he filed in july will be <unk> interior minister bernard cazeneuve announced thursday
cazeneuve will conduct bathily's citizenship ceremony himself tuesday
this event will add to what has been an emotional few weeks for bathily starting with his <unk> actions friday after a gunman burst in while he was working at the kosher hyper <unk> grocery store near paris porte de vincennes
the man took several people hostage but not the fifteen whom bathily led <unk> into a walk in freezer
bathily who describes himself as a practicing muslim told cnn affiliate bfmtv he switched off the freezer turned off the lights and told everyone to stay calm
i'm the one is going to go out the twenty four year old reportedly told the customers
i took the elevator and went upstairs
bathily told bfmtv that he went up after the hostage taker whom authorities have identified as amedy coulibaly asked us to all come upstairs
if they didn't
otherwise he would kill everyone who was <unk> the young man said
so bathily did go upstairs taking a <unk> elevator
but he didn't go toward coulibaly
instead he ran outside
police <unk> bathily there and he told them the location of the freezer and gave details about those inside
when came out they <unk> me bathily told bfmtv
that's because his actions might have saved their lives
four people plus the gunman ended up being killed by the time the hostage situation ended
french media quickly ran with the story of bathily with l'express newspaper <unk> lassana bathily malian muslim hero of the hostage situation in vincennes
people around the world also <unk> bathily with about three hundred thousand signing a change dot <unk> petition asking that he be given the legion <unk> a highly prestigious award given to those who done exceptional things for france
even in darkness and <unk> there's always a ray of light somewhere wrote the <unk> creator <unk> <unk>
such is the case with lassana bathily
such positive recognition was also all over facebook where a man who claimed to be bathily's cousin <unk> bathily posted <unk> bathily you showed courage yesterday
the rest of the world would not have done it
another person wrote i have no words to express my pride in you
you put your life in danger to save others
god saw all of it and his mercy will be without fault
you are <unk> in the eyes of humanity

al qaeda in the arabian peninsula claimed responsibility wednesday for <unk> hebdo shooting
the attack was years in the making aqap commander nasr ibn ali al ansi said in a video claiming u.s. born cleric anwar al awlaki was the mastermind behind it
al awlaki was the terror group's spokesman before a u.s. drone strike killed him in yemen in two thousand and eleven
for days intelligence analysts have been trying to piece together whether the kouachi brothers the gunmen who attacked the magazine met him on trips to yemen a theory that could be <unk> by the new <unk> claim
what is al qaeda in the arabian peninsula
al ansi praised the magazine attack saying it was revenge for charlie hebdo's depictions of mohammed
u.s. authorities said they think the video is authentic
but they weren't ready to say that aqap helped carry out the assault
aqap did not claim responsibility for the kosher grocery store siege but praised it
it was a blessing from allah that the store siege in which four hostages were killed took place about the same time al ansi said
french security services have identified a suspected accomplice in that attack according to the french newspaper le parisien
police sources cited by the newspaper said one line of investigation is that the accomplice a man from a paris suburb may have driven gunman amedy coulibaly to the kosher supermarket where coulibaly later shot dead four people
coulibaly was killed in a police raid to end the siege
the kouachi brothers also are dead
but investigators efforts to track down possible suspects tied to last week's attacks are continuing
le <unk> report said investigators identified coulibaly's suspected accomplice using keys for a <unk> discovered in an apartment they raided over the weekend
neighbors told cnn the apartment in the paris suburb of <unk> was raided saturday by police
also found inside the apartment according to le parisien
a <unk> of weapons explosives and two isis flags
coulibaly purportedly told authorities before he was killed that he belonged to isis
police also think the suspected accomplice may have been responsible for shooting and wounding a jogger last week an attack that the paris prosecutor has said could be tied to coulibaly because the ammunition used was the same as ammunition found at the scene of the kosher market attack le parisien said
paris police would not comment to cnn on the contents of the report
le parisien says coulibaly's suspected accomplice whom the newspaper did not name may have fled france possibly for syria
officials have also said they believe hayat boumeddiene coulibaly's widow may have played a role in the attacks and has fled to syria
coulibaly and boumeddiene drove from france to madrid on december thirty one a spanish source close to the nation's security sources told cnn

loose stones <unk> from the <unk> of the walls far up on the <unk>
all around me tree <unk> shake
it's just after dawn and i'm alone climbing the trail to the fifteen th century royal compound on the <unk> at great zimbabwe in southern africa
alone except for the <unk>
like all the stone structures here the <unk> is open to the sky but the <unk> is so steep and the <unk> so sharp that i can't see more than ten feet in front of me
sure enough around the next <unk> a <unk> is waiting for me on one of the dozens of <unk> that <unk> the <unk>
we watch each other for a few moments until i'm certain he's not interested in me and then i keep walking
<unk> <unk> me out but these moments are part of what makes great zimbabwe such an incredible place to visit
unlike the world's more visited ruins which is basically every other ruin here it's easy to lose yourself in the mystery of the place even if that means the <unk> standoff with a <unk>
the <unk> leads to a narrow passage through a <unk> in the <unk> <unk>
stone walls that form the perimeter of the royal complex tower overhead
they once <unk> extended even farther out over the <unk> but a <unk> collapsed since the city was abandoned bringing a wall down with it
it's hard to find a <unk> point to see the entire complex
the old city which was the capital of a trading empire and home to ten thousand people in the one thousand four hundred s <unk> over one thousand eight hundred <unk>
essentially the <unk> <unk> as a palace and cathedral the center of political and religious power
on the planes below <unk> stone walls form a series of <unk>
the most iconic <unk> called the great <unk> is the largest pre colonial structure south of the <unk>
the walls rise up thirty six feet and stretch eight hundred and twenty feet around
at one end an inner wall forms a narrow passage that leads to a <unk> tower the most <unk> landmark in the old city
i like the hill complex more
here the walls <unk> around each other and the <unk> <unk> which are <unk> into the design
different chambers are linked by a <unk> of narrow <unk> that <unk> up and down over the giant rocks
at the far side is a chamber with a <unk> stone <unk> that once held a small stone wall that acted like a <unk>
like all the structures here the stones were <unk> without mortar
each <unk> was slightly <unk> creating a <unk> that held it all together
over the centuries some walls were <unk> down by treasure hunters or just by the elements
the chamber below is where a famous set of <unk> birds were found
most of them are now housed in a small museum inside the park which is worth a visit if only to see them
the image of a bird appears on the national flag and is as much a symbol of <unk> national identity as the statue of liberty is to the united states
there's a good chance of being here alone
visitors might see schoolchildren passing through on their way to class or the <unk> park worker but not many other visitors
tourism in zimbabwe has been in a long and slow recovery
in the one thousand nine hundred and ninety s zimbabwe was for a moment the most visited country in sub <unk> africa
by the time the nation hit rock bottom in two thousand and eight hardly any foreign visitors came
now major attractions like victoria falls are <unk> back but places like great zimbabwe have fallen far off the radar
the ruins are easily accessible by road but it takes several hours from <unk> or a full day from johannesburg so not many people make the effort
but this is a place i love returning to
in the colonial days when zimbabwe was known as <unk> white families used to vacation here and <unk> of those days remain
the national park has simple <unk> <unk> for <unk> and there's the dated but <unk> great zimbabwe hotel just outside the gates as well as the <unk> safari style lodge at the ancient city
the <unk> restaurant where the <unk> is designed like the stone walls serves lucky travelers fresh <unk> from the nearby dam
if not there's almost always a fisherman selling his catch on the <unk> which can be <unk> <unk> or ask the restaurant to prepare it
on my latest trip i went with an <unk> organized by the <unk> school of arts at the university of the <unk> in johannesburg
those going on their own can <unk> a guide on site
every guide i've ever had here has been <unk> and <unk> and well informed but it's even more amazing to spend a few days exploring the ruins with people who actually wrote the book on great zimbabwe
you can find their <unk> at <unk> under history of art
practical <unk>
zimbabwe has started an online visa system which isn't working at the time of this writing
when it does <unk> online will get visitors a letter that they must present on arrival which is when the visa is actually issued
those that require a visa might be better off simply getting it on arrival
anyone driving up from south africa can save themselves a lot of <unk> at the border by <unk> the zimbabwe tourism authority ahead of time
they can arrange to have an officer to wait at the border post and walk visitors through the immigration and customs process
this can save hours and endless headaches
and it's a free service

search teams have recovered fifty bodies from the sea in the aftermath of the crash some of them still strapped into seats
officials have said many of the more than one hundred passengers and crew members who still aren't accounted for may be inside the fuselage
divers were sent to start looking for bodies in the wreckage thursday
if the bodies are still intact they will be evacuated one by one said supriyadi an operations coordinator for indonesia's search and rescue agency who goes by only one name
but the divers work has been hampered by strong currents that have reduced <unk> at the site supriyadi said according to indonesia's national news agency <unk>
if the divers efforts prove unsuccessful crews may lift the fuselage out of the water according to bambang soelistyo the head of the search and rescue agency
<unk> said that recovering her <unk> body from the wreckage would be better than not finding his body at all
after the plane went missing <unk> initially went to the city of surabaya where flight qz eight thousand five hundred and one began its journey to wait for news of her brother
but she later returned to her home in <unk> a city one thousand five hundred kilometers away from surabaya on a different indonesian island
we the family members do not hold any religious <unk> together instead we <unk> pray to god for his best decision for us all she said
investigators are analyzing the contents of flight qz eight thousand five hundred and one's flight recorders which were recovered from the sea earlier in the week
the two devices the flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder are likely to help them figure out what went wrong on the plane as it was flying toward singapore on december twenty eight
officials say a preliminary report should be released within a month of the crash
but it's unclear how much information the initial document will contain beyond what's already been made public
the final report <unk> investigators full conclusions is expected to take many more months to complete
<unk> said she will nonetheless keep monitoring the situation because i want to know why the plane my brother was on crashed
it is practically an iconic photo by now a row of world leaders standing in solidarity next to one another marching in paris united against terrorism
most of them were men but some were women including angela merkel the chancellor of germany
she was right next to french president francois hollande
but ultra orthodox israeli newspaper <unk> published a <unk> <unk> front page image of the leaders with the women removed
ultra orthodox jews traditionally don't <unk> to show images of women because it's not considered modest
as israeli newspaper <unk> noted political parties that represent the ultra orthodox sector ban women from running for office
but some feel changing the photo of the paris march went way too far
it was <unk> <unk> wrote <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
the message <unk> sent <unk> <unk> said was <unk> to denying the fact that in the wider world beyond the ultra orthodox jewish community women do stand on the world stage and shape events
in addition to merkel missing from <unk> other women leaders who disappeared from the photo are european union security and foreign affairs chief <unk> <unk> and paris mayor <unk> <unk>
some took to twitter to criticize the decision and to share the original and <unk> pictures
a satirical <unk> publication <unk> <unk> had a little fun with the story and published the photo from the paris march showing only the three women and cutting out all the men
it's not the first time an ultra orthodox publication attempted to erase a female politician
in two thousand and eleven new york based newspaper di <unk> <unk> a picture to remove then secretary of state hillary clinton out of a famous shot of white house leaders watching the raid that killed osama bin laden
it was a decade ago the war on terror was in full <unk> iraq was on fire and every day there were images of american combat soldiers on <unk> on french tv
cherif and said kouachi both in their mid twenty s were trying to find their way in the upper northwest corner of paris in the nineteen th <unk> a poor hard knock area known for its disenfranchised and at times <unk> immigrant population
in their twenty s one of the brothers favorite spots was the city's fifth largest public park the <unk> <unk> with open <unk> <unk> stunning <unk> onto the city and <unk> close to the place where for centuries criminals were <unk>
the brothers went to the park for sports training and exercise but it is there in the <unk> <unk> where they also met with more than a dozen other similar young men who would all eventually be known to police for a terrorism plot to fight as jihadis in iraq
one of the kouachi brothers would be jailed for his involvement in that plot
but the brothers journey would go far beyond the group of men plotting in the <unk> <unk> a decade ago
theirs would be a journey from youths training in a park to becoming some of the worst terrorists of the modern world
they would go from meeting disenfranchised youths to <unk> <unk> with influential international jihadi leaders
and eventually the unknown brothers actions along with their <unk> would <unk> in some of the most bloody and horrific crime scenes ever known in paris <unk> the city of light into darkness and despair
now they are dead killed by police in a <unk> after they attacked the offices of charlie hebdo a french magazine with a history of mocking mohammed
twelve people were killed including several top editors
the brothers said they were avenging the prophet
the kouachi brothers story has been put together from numerous sets of french court documents obtained by cnn in recent days along with interviews with numerous terrorist experts and former french government terrorism officials
the kouachi brothers of algerian descent lost their father when they were teens according to documents and interviews
their mother unable to care for them eventually sent them off to a state school for children with special needs in the countryside
she too would die before too long
their schooling would end before university and they eventually washed up in paris nineteen th <unk>
they survived as best they could with only odd jobs
cherif the younger brother worked as a <unk> <unk> according to documents
among those the brothers met were farid benyettou an influential and leading figure who <unk> many of the young and disenfranchised youths at the local mosque <unk> known as the mosque de <unk> according to one set of documents obtained in conjunction with l'express a french news magazine
neither brother is believed to have been particularly religious
but cherif according to documents was especially drawn by benyettou first to the idea of religious <unk> then to islamic <unk> and finally to the larger idea of jihad and fighting as a jihadi the documents show
many of the members of the gang would similarly credit benyettou
benyettou would serve as a common link for the gang of the <unk> <unk> as the group would come to be known to police in two thousand and four and <unk>
the group worked and plotted together to send young islamic immigrants from france to iraq to fight jihad against americans there police said
three of the men in the gang had already traveled to <unk> in two thousand and four when it was under the control of al qaeda in iraq's leader abu musab al zarqawi
cherif said he too wanted to travel to iraq going through syria to go and combat the americans according to documents
benyettou talked to the youths about <unk> their identities and finding their roots
the roots he referred to were those of religious <unk> and eventually jihadi fighters
he became for them a sort of religious leader a <unk> of the quran and how it applied to being a jihadi
and benyettou talked to the young men about abuses committed by the united states in iraq most notably what happened at the abu <unk> prison
in the two thousand and seven french court documents cherif kouachi stated in a <unk> i was ready to go and die in battle and i got this idea when i saw the <unk> shown by television on what was going on over there
i am speaking about the torture that the americans have inflicted on the iraqis
in the documents prosecutors outlined strong details of kouachi's interest in jihad interest in martyrdom and strong links to anti semitism attacking and killing jews
kouachi said he came to the idea of jihad through benyettou
kouachi said he likely would not have pursued the idea had it not been for benyettou
through benyettou kouachi was studying how to <unk> arms and use <unk>
under a section titled <unk> of influence describing kouachi court records said he stated the wise leaders in islam told him and his friends that if they die as martyrs in jihad they would go to heaven
benyettou told them that martyrs would be greeted by more than sixty <unk> in a big palace in heaven
the documents also said kouachi had come to feel that any place on earth where there is such an injustice is justification for jihad
what was going on in iraq was in his eyes such an injustice
kouachi said he didn't consider himself a good enough muslim and said he had only been to the mosque two or three times before he met benyettou and he had been smoking <unk>
kouachi told investigators he committed himself to the idea of jihad during ramadan in two thousand and four
he told his friends he was going to syria to fight
when police interviewed his accomplices they stated that kouachi said he was ready to <unk> and to destroy jewish shops in paris
but when officials confronted kouachi with that information he told them that's not exactly what i said
i don't hide having proposed anti semitic ideas but i would note that i never really would have done that
kouachi however never made it to iraq
he was detained along with six others including benyettou in two thousand and five
they were charged with conspiring to commit acts of terrorism
kouachi told the court he was relieved he was detained
french journalist <unk> <unk> interviewed kouachi's social worker who said kouachi said he was finished with so called jihad documents show
but in prison the real radicalization began for cherif kouachi and it would ultimately lead him and his older brother said to terrible acts
cherif kouachi was in prison with other hard <unk> including a central figure in the al qaeda networks in europe said jean charles <unk> the head of the french center for the analysis of terrorism
the central figure in prison was djamel beghal also of algerian origin who was jailed for plotting to attack the u.s. embassy in paris in two thousand and one
in prison beghal became the mentor the spiritual mentor and continued the work in some way <unk> by benyettou said <unk>
beghal would prove to be <unk> to the evolution and radicalization of the brothers and their friends
it was only the latest step in beghal's long history of <unk> future terrorists
once known as al qaeda's premiere european recruiter beghal was convicted himself of conspiring to attack the u.s. embassy in paris
beghal was in direct contact with the highest ranking members of al qaeda at the time said <unk>
beghal's ties to al qaeda stretch back before the nine eleven attacks in the united states against the world trade center and the pentagon sources told cnn
he was put in charge of the plot to blow up the u.s. embassy in paris according to court documents
he was ultimately convicted in a french court
beghal's mentor was <unk> park mosque cleric abu <unk> al <unk> who was only last week convicted on terrorism charges by a federal judge in new york
he was sentenced to life in prison
al <unk> is believed to have radicalized and influenced convicted terrorists <unk> bomber richard <unk> and nine <unk> <unk> <unk>
documents show beghal later came to be referred to as abu <unk> out of respect for beghal's mentor
cherif and beghal grew close during <unk> time in prison from two thousand and five through two thousand and eight and it is believed the far more radical and jihadi focused beghal had a significant affect
another <unk> young and angry muslim also in prison was amedy coulibaly the third attacker in paris last week who is accused of killing a french police officer and killing four more people at a kosher grocery store
coulibaly and cherif kouachi met in prison where coulibaly was serving a sentence for armed <unk> according to court documents
the radical jihadi leader beghal became a tie between kouachi and coulibaly
beghal got out of jail in mid two thousand and nine and from that point on kouachi and coulibaly went to visit beghal at his place at <unk> in <unk>
they would bring beghal food and money
also part of the visits was coulibaly's partner hayat boumeddiene who is on the run and wanted by police as a suspect in the kosher grocery store incident
authorities say beghal kouachi and coulibaly in two thousand and ten plotted to break out another imprisoned algerian terrorist <unk> <unk> ali <unk>
<unk> had been imprisoned for one thousand nine hundred and ninety five bombings in the paris <unk> system
court documents detail how kouachi and coulibaly worked with beghal hiding their conversations by using code names over <unk> cell phones
in april two thousand and ten both kouachi and coulibaly were even staying with beghal sometimes for days
sometimes hayat boumeddiene joined the visits
coulibaly is described in the documents as the logistics expert who was in charge of gathering the weapons and arms in the plot to spring <unk>
there were elaborate details sophisticated computers <unk> details of one way tickets and <unk> notes in arabic that when translated turned out to be <unk> for poison
in may two thousand and ten in the department of <unk> saint <unk> coulibaly was found to have illegally stored a huge <unk> of high <unk> arms including some two hundred and forty <unk> for high powered machine guns with the specific goal of seriously hurting people through <unk> or terror acts in violation of numerous national security laws
kouachi coulibaly and beghal eventually would be arrested for the plot
but while coulibaly went to jail kouachi did not because there was not enough evidence
coulibaly was released early <unk> in two thousand and fourteen
beghal was sentenced to twelve years in prison and remains behind bars
al qaeda in the arabian peninsula commander nasr ibn ali al <unk> twelve minute message <unk> brothers said and cherif kouachi to be in the group's eyes heroes who were assigned and accepted and fulfilled a task
it claims that much of what remains of al qaeda's command was somehow involved in choosing the charlie hebdo magazine as a target
several times it <unk> the name of osama bin laden and his successor <unk> al <unk> names that in the current focus on isis rampage across the middle east seem almost to <unk> from a time of jihad past
a vital part of the claim is its <unk> that amedy coulibaly the gunman who attacked the kosher grocery store was not part of their operation but his attack <unk> with theirs as good fortune
coulibaly left a long video in which he pledged <unk> or allegiance to abu bakr al baghdadi the head of isis
this <unk> at the growing and deeply troubling <unk> of sorts between isis and the older brand of jihad al qaeda
while it seems at first bizarre that two groups with <unk> similar goals would conflict the <unk> worlds of al qaeda and isis have been apparent for some time now
al qaeda's <unk> in syria al nusra front is hit by u.s. airstrikes along with isis and both are described as terror groups by the u.s. government but the al qaeda affiliate does at times <unk> with isis for territory and resources
last spring al qaeda's leader al <unk> <unk> himself from the <unk> more <unk> <unk> of isis a move that <unk> for now their paths would continue to <unk>
al qaeda in the arabian <unk> message wednesday doesn't <unk> out how to connect the <unk> <unk> between the kouachi brothers <unk> <unk> they were working for al qaeda in yemen and the yemeni jihadis themselves that's something investigators have to work on to prove
are there real and genuine logistical links between that paris street and the radical cells training in the desert
but it does make some <unk> claims that are partially backed up by suggestions from some officials
the al qaeda in the arabian peninsula statement claims that the late anwar al awlaki was somehow involved <unk> in the plan to target charlie hebdo
that is a hugely <unk> statement
al awlaki a recruiter and radical <unk> for al qaeda and an american citizen of yemeni heritage has long been dead killed by an american drone strike in two thousand and eleven
said and or cherif kouachi were in yemen in two thousand and eleven according to witnesses and officials although investigators are still working out their exact movements with said possibly there as early as two thousand and nine when it is alleged he <unk> briefly with umar farouk abdulmutallab the underwear bomber who targeted a plane to detroit in two thousand and nine
were al awlaki the <unk> of the attack someone who laid on the logistical support <unk> or chose the target as the al qaeda in the arabian peninsula statement suggests then the kouachi brothers would have been <unk> for three years before launching their attack on january seven
investigators will be desperate to know if there was any further contact between two thousand and eleven and the paris attacks whether the orders and logistics were in place by two thousand and eleven or further assistance or instructions came closer to the moment
were it the former this would be a truly <unk> sleeper cell <unk> for years and then at a <unk> notice deadly
above all wednesday's long and <unk> statement shows an al qaeda desperate not to be <unk> by its <unk> and at times in the gruesome <unk> of this world more radical cousin isis
the names and faces of their leaders alive and dead live on particularly that of al awlaki who it is said threatens the west both in his life and after his martyrdom
it's a <unk> sign al qaeda may very much be a current and real danger
if they're not tossed from a train or left in a desert they may be <unk> or worse
people would tell me
well we've kind of accepted or we're used to being <unk> and beaten and <unk> photographer michelle frankfurter said
they're willing to risk all that she said
it <unk> some light on just how bad things are in <unk> el <unk> and guatemala
between two thousand and nine and two thousand and fourteen frankfurter took several trips to mexico to document migrants journey from the country's southern border to its northern one
she was inspired by <unk> journey a book by <unk> prize winning journalist <unk> <unk> which tells the story of a <unk> boy risking it all to reunite with his mother in the united states
i watched these people leave everything behind leave with nothing but a little <unk> with a few belongings and then this faith that they have frankfurter said
there's a lot of sadness and <unk> but there's a lot of beauty in it as well she said
she described her favorite photograph from the series
taken inside a makeshift <unk> it shows a <unk> a wounded man and several migrants resting on the floor alongside dogs
i've been to that particular place a number of times and i never ever saw that kind of <unk> of elements together in one single image like that she said
everything to me is in that one photograph
frankfurter found people to follow at shelters
she'd spend a couple days with a group before <unk> out to the rail yard and <unk> a train
rather than see the current rush of migrants as something like the break of a dam frankfurter has watched the pressure build for decades as civil wars trade policies and a booming drug trade combine to <unk> people from all sides
she lived in <unk> in the late one thousand nine hundred and ninety s
i kept thinking that i would see that wave <unk> off
and instead there was just this dramatic <unk> frankfurter said
it seems like a story that just keeps <unk> in a way but just keeps on going and that there is no real end to it
michelle frankfurter is a photographer based in <unk>
you can follow her blog
yet this outpouring of solidarity must not <unk> another response across the continent
leaders of europe's far right have been quick to blame islam and immigration mosques have been <unk> in france and elsewhere and a <unk> movement called patriotic europeans against the islamization of the <unk> brought tens of thousands to the streets of germany this week
this extreme <unk> of european <unk> and politics will likely receive a boost from the french tragedy
anti immigration and anti islamic sentiments have been on a steady rise in europe for years
while a majority of europeans <unk> <unk> and migration within the european union they are largely negative about immigration from outside of the eu according to the latest <unk> survey
this opposition is particularly pronounced towards muslim immigrants
half and more of all europeans view islam as <unk> with the western world while islam is seen as an outright threat by between one third of all <unk> and almost two thirds of all <unk> according to a recent <unk> study
<unk> of such views will surely see the paris attacks as confirmation
many others may now question their <unk> more moderate opinions
it is these sentiments along with fears over economic prospects <unk> to the political establishment and doubts in the european project that <unk> and typically far right parties have successfully <unk> in recent years
virtually every eu country has seen the rise of such a political force and their combined representation in the european parliament has shot up to twenty percents in last year's elections
for these parties the paris attacks truly are a told you so moment
<unk> <unk> of the united kingdom independence party blamed a fifth column within our countries while <unk> <unk> of the freedom party in the netherlands claimed that it was time to de <unk> our country
marine le pen of the french front national urged that <unk> up for denial and hypocrisy and alexander <unk> of the alternative for germany saw all those proven wrong who had ignored the islamist threat
sadly these <unk> are more likely than ever before now to <unk> with european <unk>
this combination of a <unk> portion of europeans that are skeptical of if not outright hostile to muslims and migrants and the ever more aggressive rhetoric of the <unk> far right puts a massive pressure on europe's politics and societies alike
first and foremost europe's muslim communities are likely to suffer
although in their overwhelming majority they are integrated and identify with europe blanket suspicion against islam <unk> in day to day life and assaults on their community are bound to increase and <unk> fear and <unk> among muslims
this will feed <unk> among muslim and non muslim communities and provide a <unk> ground for the radicalization of some young muslims
in short european muslims are at risk of being driven away from mainstream european societies
<unk> the political climate and culture in europe will change
under attack from extremists whether in parliament or in the streets mainstream political parties will be <unk> to move away from their typically <unk> whether somewhat to the left or right positions
politics will move to <unk> immigration laws select highly skilled migrants over refugees from war zones push for their greater <unk> and <unk> additional security measures
as a result further <unk> of european citizens are likely to be <unk> as political <unk> try to <unk> a further growth of extremist parties
this is a <unk> <unk> as radicals will quickly produce the next <unk> that they demand to be addressed
<unk> this changing climate and politics will also impact on migration and migrants <unk> beyond muslims
already there have been fierce <unk> to limit <unk> european migration whether <unk> to central and eastern europeans after their countries joined the european union or restrictions on social benefits eu citizens can draw across borders
much as these <unk> are already taking their toll on some of europe's poorest such as the <unk> future <unk> to immigration to the eu will likely <unk> some of the world's most <unk> such as asylum <unk>
fortress europe will become even more of a reality
europe can still <unk> this dangerous trend
millions of french people of all <unk> and faiths have given a powerful example of unity <unk> and <unk> last week as have tens of thousands of pro tolerance and pro immigration <unk> in germany this week
it is now also on europe's political class to <unk> <unk> the many told you <unk> on the continent
read
attack will <unk> europe's far right
the developments came as deputy prime minister <unk> <unk> wrote on twitter those who are publishing figures referring to our supreme prophet are those who disregard the sacred
such a move is open <unk> and provocation he added
turkey is home to eighty two million people ninety nine point eight percents of whom are muslim according to the cia world <unk>
the french satirical publication charlie hebdo's new cover contains what it calls a <unk> of the prophet mohammed holding a sign saying je suis charlie
the caption says all is forgiven in french
it comes a week after islamist terrorists killed twelve people at the <unk> offices
police went to the offices of istanbul newspaper <unk> and blocked off traffic around it after the paper published <unk> from the charlie hebdo issue
armored police blocked the entrance and stopped distribution trucks at the printing press in istanbul the secular daily said
the prosecutor's office then stopped the <unk> possibly because it did not know the image was inside the paper according to the report
<unk> included a four page <unk> of charlie hebdo's latest edition translated into turkish
that <unk> which the prosecutor's office saw did not include the cover the paper said
but inside the paper two <unk> had included small images of the cover with their <unk> the paper reported
an editorial in the newspaper said the drawing on the charlie hebdo cover did not seem to have anything to do with prophet mohammed
that drawing is a symbol of a <unk> and <unk> attitude and it says all is forgiven
<unk> editor in chief <unk> <unk> explained on twitter and on the <unk> website that <unk> has lost writers to terror attacks and <unk> the charlie hebdo massacre very well
three protesters were arrested in front of <unk> offices cnn <unk> reported
the rise of islamic state in iraq and syria the islamist militant group that has seized a <unk> of land <unk> from northern syria to central iraq has struck fear into the hearts of leaders around the world
cnn explains isis roots what it controls and where its support comes from
the group began in two thousand and four as al qaeda in iraq before <unk> as isis two years later
it was an ally of and had <unk> with osama bin <unk> al qaeda
both were radical anti western militant groups devoted to establishing an independent islamic state in the region
but isis unlike al qaeda which <unk> the group in early two thousand and fourteen has proven to be more brutal and more effective at controlling territory it has seized
isis is putting governing structures in place to rule the territories the group <unk> once the dust <unk> on the battlefield
from the cabinet and the <unk> to the financial and <unk> bodies isis <unk> <unk> looks a lot like those of some of the western countries whose values it <unk> if you take away the democracy and add in a council to consider who should be beheaded
the group seized control of mosul iraq's second largest city this summer
but its power base is in raqqa eastern syria where isis is now in control of more than half of syria's oil assets along with a number of oil fields in iraq according to energy expert <unk> al <unk>
al <unk> says the oil is finding its way to the black market and could be making isis up to three million dollar each day
more than eleven thousand people have traveled from abroad to fight in syria and iraq officials suggest although some have gone back home again
they <unk> themselves with different factions and sometimes change <unk> as groups <unk> <unk> or change <unk>
naturally countries with bigger muslim populations tend to send the largest number of fighters
but some nations with relatively small muslim populations have sent a <unk> large number of jihadis
finland ireland and australia have the highest number of foreign fighters per capita although <unk> security officials say a minority of <unk> in their count went for humanitarian reasons
one man dominated the headlines <unk> optimism
india's new prime minister narendra modi
modi has <unk> a role for himself not only as ceo of india <unk> but also as its global ambassador with <unk> <unk> promoting india in new york tokyo and sydney
he is also india's brand manager launching <unk> campaigns such as make in india <unk> and digital india
modi has won a broad <unk> as <unk> by his party's performance in <unk> state elections in december
and yet two thousand and fifteen marks the end of modi's <unk>
after all hope can only go so far
modi's greatest <unk> in two thousand and fourteen was to offer promise
he <unk> weary indians
he convinced the world that india had a giant open sign on its front <unk> almost literally with <unk> on arrival
he spent much of the year in campaign mode in india and abroad
but in two thousand and fifteen modi will need to transition from <unk> to <unk> or else risk <unk> another generation
that suggests two thousand and fifteen will be a defining year for india
let's start with economics
india was <unk> with favorable tail winds last year
at the start of modi's term <unk> crude was trading at about one hundred and ten dollar a barrel
by year end prices had <unk>
cheaper oil was a <unk> to india's economy
the <unk> <unk> inflation fell and perhaps most <unk> the government took the opportunity to end decades of <unk> and <unk> diesel
new taxes on oil look set to generate billions of dollars in excess revenue every year
india's government will look to use that money well
can it deliver on its promises of clean water and power to one point two five billion indians
can it really improve india's broken infrastructure <unk> roads trains and bridges some of which never seem to connect
can it begin to <unk> its promise to put a <unk> in every home
or has too much been promised
in any case india needs much more money and investment likely from abroad
and modi will need another important currency
cooperation from his lawmakers
india needs to rid itself of <unk> laws on <unk> <unk>
it will look to <unk> its states under a common tax system to foster free trade and business
but these acts will take political will and <unk>
can modi <unk> as well as he can campaign
can he really as his government has promised improve india's ranking for doing business from a <unk> one hundred and forty two <unk> in the world to somewhere in the top fifty
these are all questions that modi will need to answer in two thousand and fifteen
foreign policy has come easily to modi so far
he will begin two thousand and fifteen <unk> in the <unk> of receiving president barack obama the chief guest at india's republic day on january twenty six
obama will be the first sitting american president to visit india more than once
for modi however good foreign policy means good business
he will look to strike deals not only with obama but with many other world leaders in two thousand and fifteen on energy trade defense and infrastructure <unk>
all that sounds right up modi's <unk>
the great unknown is how he will respond to a major foreign policy crisis the likes of which he largely escaped in two thousand and fourteen
how will he react to a major <unk> with pakistan
how will he balance his desire to boost chinese trade with fears about beijing's growing <unk> in the region
and what will he do if in a big global crisis he is pushed to choose sides between any of russia china and the united states
can india remain <unk> friend
will modi develop a values based vision of india's place in the world
on domestic issues a year ago modi was known outside india mostly for his <unk> or worse <unk> in stopping one of the worst religious <unk> in modern indian history when some two thousand muslims were killed in <unk> the state he ran at the time
modi's perceived role led to his u.s. visa being <unk>
a year on new york city received modi as if he were a rock star
in the space of a year modi has managed to transform his image abroad from <unk> to <unk> leader
recent events are cause for renewed worry
reports of hindu groups forcing christians and muslims to convert to <unk> <unk> the very basis of the indian secular state
minorities simply can not live in fear
in two thousand and fifteen modi will need not only to be a voice of reason but he will also have to <unk> in radical <unk> elements of his hindu support base
the safety of women will remain a major issue of concern at home and abroad
at his two thousand and fourteen independence day speech modi <unk> how the indian people's heads hang in shame with each report of rape
the sad reality is that modi will probably make the same comment at this year's speech
as i've written previously india has let its women down for centuries
they rank one hundred and thirty four th in the world for economic opportunities one hundred and twenty six th for education and one hundred and forty one st for health
how can that be good enough for a country that <unk> to be a major world power
beyond politics from living and reporting in india i am hopeful about this country's future
my optimism is based less on politics or economics and more on a larger trend
the country's technology <unk>
while the west has evolved in its internet use from <unk> up to cable to mobile four g india's journey has been different
it has jumped straight to a mobile revolution
most indians who <unk> the internet will <unk> it on a cheap smartphone not a <unk>
the pace of technology <unk> coupled with faster and cheaper <unk> will transform india in ways we are only just beginning to <unk>
so expect india to start <unk> many of the problems the west has spent decades dealing with
india has never had a real database of its citizens but soon it will be the first country to have an entirely digital <unk> <unk> system
there will be real changes in people's lives and their economies with the help of e commerce and apps for health education banking and transport
beyond oil politics or <unk> the biggest tail wind for india lies in its <unk> of technology
this will be india's real revolution and it is already underway
here's what we know about the islamist extremist group
aqap has its home in yemen an impoverished and troubled nation that borders saudi arabia and oman and eyes strife torn somalia across the gulf of aden
in recent months the sunni extremist group has come under pressure within yemen from shiite houthi rebels and government forces
but the paris attack shows the group's apparent continued ability to direct operations beyond yemen's borders
its influence on would be jihadis is also <unk> thanks to its slick english language online magazine inspire first published in two thousand and ten
as military operations in afghanistan and pakistan have <unk> the central leadership of al qaeda its affiliates have stepped forward as the main perpetrators of terror attacks though recently challenged for the spotlight by isis
aqap chief <unk> al wuhayshi is al qaeda's no
two and has so far remained loyal to the terror <unk> leader <unk> al <unk>
he was designated as al <unk> global deputy in two thousand and thirteen
aqap late last year issued a <unk> to isis already cut off by al qaeda's general command in february <unk> a certain <unk> between al qaeda and isis as the latter <unk> to extend its reach beyond iraq and syria
some analysts say that <unk> could <unk> each terror group to escalate
the <unk> and the competition between al qaeda and isis is tremendous says matthew <unk> at the washington institute for near east policy
they're in competition for money
they're in competition for recruits
they're in competition for the attention of the media
he said aqap had recently been <unk> in the race for global impact
they hadn't carried out anything spectacular in quite some time and were becoming second <unk> to their jihadi competitors in isis he said
meanwhile isis has tremendous things to point to for their success
the holding of territory
they've established a caliphate
the vast majority of foreign fighters who are traveling from around the world are <unk> not to al qaeda but to isis
al qaeda in the arabian peninsula first emerged in saudi arabia in two thousand and two but thanks to the efforts of the saudi authorities was a mostly spent force by two thousand and five according to analysis from <unk> world insurgency and terrorism
it re emerged <unk> in yemen in two thousand and nine after the saudi <unk> <unk> with a yemeni al qaeda <unk> the analysis said
in a video statement released a week after the bloody shooting at the magazine's paris offices aqap commander nasr ibn ali al ansi claimed full responsibility for the attack
we <unk> to the islamic world that the one who chose the target laid the plan <unk> the operation and appointed its emir is the leadership of the organization he said
al ansi described the kouachi brothers as heroes saying they not only accepted their terror <unk> but promised and fulfilled
he said the <unk> for the operation had been made by the group's late leader radical american cleric anwar al awlaki who threatens the west both in his life and after his martyrdom
the attack was revenge for the magazine's depictions of the prophet mohammed he said
al ansi blamed not only charlie hebdo but also france and the united states in his statement
u.s. national security council spokesman <unk> <unk> said the intelligence community was working to determine the <unk> authenticity
there have been conflicting accounts as to which of the brothers went to yemen or whether indeed it was both and how many times
but a senior yemeni security source told cnn the <unk> believe both were in yemen for about three months starting in april two thousand and eleven
it is unclear how much of the time the brothers spent together
the official added the <unk> do not believe cherif attended language schools in sanaa as his brother had earlier
it is thought likely that one or both of the brothers received weapons training from aqap while in yemen and that one may have met with al awlaki
a yemeni journalist and researcher mohammed al <unk> told cnn he had twice met and spoken with said kouachi in the capital sanaa and that kouachi had briefly <unk> there with the failed underwear bomber umar farouk abdulmutallab
investigators believe cherif kouachi was in yemen in two thousand and eleven and that when he left he was carrying money from aqap <unk> to carry out attacks a u.s. official told cnn
the investigators believe aqap could have provided as much as twenty thousand dollar but the united states hasn't verified the exact amount
u.s. officials consider aqap the most dangerous branch of al qaeda according to cnn terrorism analyst paul cruickshank
in november aqap released a statement calling on muslims around the world to forget their differences and <unk> their efforts to carry out operations against american targets whether civilian military or diplomatic
the u.s. state <unk> <unk> for justice program has posted a reward of up to ten million dollar for information that brings al wuhayshi to justice saying he has provided significant support for aqap terrorist operations
he has been a specially designated global terrorist since two thousand and ten
and while al awlaki was killed in a u.s. drone strike in yemen in two thousand and eleven the radical <unk> influence lives on and with it a threat to the united states says cnn national security analyst peter bergen
al awlaki was an influence on <unk> and <unk> <unk> who are alleged to have killed three people in the boston marathon bombings in two thousand and thirteen bergen said
he also influenced carlos <unk> who shot up an army recruiting center in little rock <unk> killing an american soldier in two thousand and nine
after the attacks <unk> said his spiritual inspiration was al awlaki
maj. <unk> <unk> killed thirteen people at fort <unk> texas in two thousand and nine after sending eighteen <unk> to al awlaki in yemen a <unk> that was known to the fbi
al awlaki did not direct this attack but he was the key inspiration for <unk>
<unk> <unk> attempt to bring down an american jet over detroit in the fall of two thousand and nine also was directed by al awlaki bergen said
a video released by <unk> official media arm in december showed a short clip of abdulmutallab together with both al wuhayshi and al awlaki
aqap set out its <unk> in a may two thousand and ten statement as the <unk> of jews and <unk> from the arabian peninsula the re establishment of the islamic caliphate the <unk> of sharia or islamic law and the liberation of muslim <unk> according to analysis from <unk> world insurgency and terrorism
this suggests the group aims to rid yemen and saudi arabia of non muslims and <unk> the nations governments to be replaced with what it considers to be an islamic state
to that end it has targeted foreigners and government forces in yemen as well as saudi leaders
in two thousand and nine prince mohammed bin <unk> bin abdulaziz the saudi arabian deputy minister of interior survived a bomb attack carried out by an aqap militant
through its inspire magazine the group also hopes to <unk> western muslims and <unk> grass roots jihadist action in western nations the <unk> report says
the group's current <unk> is widely considered to be the al qaeda regional <unk> that represents the most serious international threat it <unk>
a possible <unk> leak in the <unk> system had the crew from the american segment of the station move temporarily to the russian segment
it was a false alarm nasa said
tests indicated that the off scale <unk> were the result of a computer failure and not an <unk> leak
international space station program manager mike <unk> said the <unk> was done as a <unk> because of four <unk> that were off scale
these measures could have indicated an <unk> leak
the astronauts as trained put on masks moved to the russian segment and closed the <unk> to the american segment he said
two u.s. astronauts are aboard the international space station
commander <unk> <unk> and flight engineer terry <unk>
once it was determined that the emergency was a false alarm the astronauts still had to wait while equipment on the u.s. segment was powered back up <unk> said
nasa tweeted that at three five p.m
et the <unk> was <unk> and the astronauts returned
there was no <unk> in the area nasa said
the crew was unable to carry out <unk> that were planned but no research was lost <unk> said
the americans were joined by <unk> <unk> a flight engineer with the european space agency and others in the space <unk> six member crew
<unk> everybody thanks for your concern <unk> tweeted
we're all safe and doing well in the russian segment
the new ban in <unk> was approved by local <unk> last month and given the <unk> by the regional <unk> at the weekend
the <unk> name suggests it targets <unk> <unk> covering someone's full body including the face which is called a <unk> in some islamic traditions
a spate of recent violent incidents has rocked xinjiang a resource rich region long <unk> by the <unk> speaking largely muslim uyghurs
the arrival of waves of <unk> chinese the country's <unk> ethnic group over the past decades has fueled ethnic tensions
chinese officials have blamed the recent attacks on uyghur separatists whom they also label religious extremists seeking to establish an independent state
last august another city in xinjiang banned people wearing islamic style clothing and large beards from riding public buses during a provincial sporting event according to state media
news reports at the time said <unk> city authorities targeted <unk> large beards as well as three types of islamic dresses including those with the star and <unk> symbol
dozens of bus stations in the city were said to be manned by security personnel to conduct checks and report <unk> to the police
while the measures in <unk> didn't openly single out uyghurs exiled uyghur rights groups have condemned them calling the ban a green light for racism and discrimination
those restrictions came shortly after after authorities in xinjiang banned students and civil <unk> from <unk> during ramadan the muslim holy month
amnesty international has said uyghurs face widespread discrimination in employment housing and educational opportunities as well as <unk> religious freedom and political <unk>
other critics including exiled uyghur activists have attributed the rise of violence in xinjiang to beijing's increasingly <unk> rule there a claim the government <unk> <unk>
the newborn babies many suffering from hiv aids and <unk> were sold for between fifty thousand yuan to eighty thousand yuan
the boys <unk> higher prices than girls according to the online video report published on tuesday
babies were often transported in large <unk> and <unk> to prospective buyers
and they were allegedly fed instant <unk> and <unk> vegetables according to chinese state media
authorities have arrested one hundred and three people suspected of trafficking or <unk> the <unk>
police spotted a suspicious group of pregnant women being <unk> into an abandoned factory in the city of <unk> last july where they found baby <unk> and other evidence of it being used as an underground delivery room
we noticed there has been some new developments in the methods for child trafficking related crimes <unk> <unk> director of the ministry of public <unk> anti trafficking office told <unk>
for example some criminal <unk> would send pregnant women who are about to give birth via public transport to another city
the babies are then sold after the women give birth says <unk>
an investigator who was on the case said they detained seven suspects and found one baby nearly <unk> under blankets in the run down factory with <unk> living conditions
at that time the <unk> face was already turning purple if we didn't search through those blankets that baby may have already died said liu yang a police investigator
in a two month <unk> operation following the raid police discovered that the babies were often transported from the factory in bags to a hospital for infectious diseases in a nearby suburb where they were kept awaiting buyers
out of the thirty seven babies we rescued almost none of them were healthy
all had varying levels of some <unk>
they let the babies eat instant <unk> said <unk> jun a local police officer
one of the buyers liu <unk> said an agent told him it was an <unk> child from a student
some of the babies have remained with their adoptive parents while others are in <unk>
the three year old was reunited with her mother according to chinese media
according to chinese law child traffickers can be imprisoned up to ten years for selling more than three children or sentenced to death in more serious cases
child trafficking has become a major concern in china as traffickers seek to profit off a growing demand for healthy babies from potential adoptive parents both in china and beyond
in march last year chinese officials <unk> four child trafficking rings and arrested more than a thousand people for using websites and instant messaging groups to sell babies
a chinese <unk> was also convicted for selling babies after telling their parents they were sick in early two thousand and fourteen
the confirmation follows major developments in the investigation of the disaster the <unk> earlier this week of the plane's flight data and cockpit voice recorders
searchers saw the plane's main body with one of its wings attached via a camera carried by a <unk> operated underwater vehicle indonesia search chief bambang soelistyo said
key in identifying the debris are the words painted on the section
pictures released by the search agency appear to show <unk> of the words now and everyone
airasia says the slogan now everyone can fly had been on the length of the plane which crashed december twenty eight as it flew toward singapore from the indonesian city of surabaya
divers will search the fuselage for bodies thursday and if the divers encounter trouble crews may lift the fuselage out of the water soelistyo said
officials didn't mention the depth of the water
but officials have said other debris such as the recorders which were found about a half mile from the fuselage on monday and tuesday were discovered at a depth of roughly thirty meters
at least fifty bodies have been recovered from the sea soelistyo said
some were strapped into seats
officials have said that many of the more than one hundred remaining bodies might be found in or near the plane's fuselage
the majority of the people on flight qz eight thousand five hundred and one were indonesian
citizens of britain france malaysia singapore and south korea also were aboard
soelistyo said the discovered portion of the fuselage is about one hundred feet long
that would represent the majority of the airbus a three hundred and twenty two hundred which was about one hundred and twenty feet long
authorities don't know why the plane crashed
roughly thirty five minutes into the flight the pilot asked air traffic control for permission to turn left and climb to avoid bad weather
minutes later the plane disappeared from radar
on tuesday divers <unk> the cockpit voice recorder which is designed to <unk> all sounds on a plane's flight deck
a day earlier searchers recovered the plane's other key information source the flight data recorder which stores a vast amount of information about the aircraft's performance including air speed and cabin pressure
both devices are expected to help investigators understand what went wrong
the flight data recorder tells investigators what happened on a plane but the cockpit voice recorder tells them why said mardjono <unk> a senior official at indonesia's national transportation safety committee which is leading the investigation into the disaster
the why is mostly in there he said of the voice recorder which captures conversations between pilots as well as other sounds in the cockpit
the two flight recorders were taken to a lab in jakarta the indonesian capital for analysis
investigators say they have successfully <unk> the contents of both devices
but mardjono cautioned that <unk> the information requires much more time
after the <unk> investigators should have a pretty good idea within a couple of days of what happened aboard the plane mary schiavo a former inspector general of the u.s. department of transportation said this week
the flight data recorder usually contains hundreds of <unk> and thousands of data points she said that look a bit like an <unk> when they're printed
mardjono said he expected a preliminary report to be released within a month of the crash
but it's unclear how much information the initial document will contain beyond what's already been made public
the final report <unk> investigators full conclusions will take months mardjono said
the agency's final report into adam air flight five hundred and seventy four which crashed in indonesian waters on new year's day two thousand and seven killing all one hundred and two people on board came out more than a year after that disaster
mardjono said the airasia plane's flight data recorder was in good condition after being pulled out of the water from under the debris of a wing monday
the recovery of the recorders took place after the plane's tail was lifted from the waves saturday
observers have suggested that the locations of the different parts of debris indicate the plane broke apart when it hit the water not when it was still at a high altitude
one indonesian search official who goes by the single name of supriyadi said that the debris patterns suggest the aircraft exploded on impact
but the country's transportation investigators said it was premature to say what had happened and one expert questioned the search <unk> choice of words
the word exploded i think maybe loses a little bit in translation said david soucie a former federal aviation administration safety inspector
i think really what he's meaning is a <unk> from the impact itself
as with any <unk> object hitting something very hard the pressure <unk> between the outside and the inside is very significant and it'll actually tear apart the aircraft on the top soucie said
that may be what he's referring to
that picture looks much more complex one week later
two more attacks against a police officer and another that included hostages at a kosher supermarket brought the final death toll to seventeen plus three suspects killed
the <unk> that investigators have followed from the newsroom of the satirical magazine and the paris supermarket have led to other countries including yemen turkey syria and <unk>
the <unk> of who was behind the attacks has also revealed other suspects and there have been claims of links to the biggest terrorist groups al qaeda and isis which now calls itself the islamic state
here is a look at the key people places and questions that have surfaced as investigators probe more deeply
besides said and cherif kouachi the brothers identified as the <unk> at charlie hebdo who were later killed by police another man amedy coulibaly has been linked to the attacks
police killed him last week after he took hostages at the paris kosher grocery store
there is one named suspect at large
hayat boumeddiene coulibaly's widow
but there are other suspects
french citizen <unk> <unk> <unk> was arrested in <unk> at the border with turkey on an unrelated charge but he faces terrorism charges in connection with the <unk>
and french security services have identified a suspected accomplice in the kosher grocery attack according to the french newspaper le parisien
police sources cited by the newspaper said one line of investigation is that the accomplice a man from a paris suburb may have driven coulibaly to the market where coulibaly later shot dead four people
we are doing everything we can to <unk> what appears to be a network
no doubt there was <unk> and networks and maybe finance also valls told cnn's christiane amanpour
given the magnitude of the operations and the apparent sophistication of the gunmen many wonder who if anyone trained or possibly gave orders to the attackers
al qaeda in the arabian peninsula or aqap has claimed credit for the magazine attack
when the heroes were assigned they accepted
they promised and fulfilled aqap commander nasr ibn ali al ansi said in a video message referring to the kouachi brothers and the slayings at charlie hebdo
the late u.s. born muslim cleric anwar al awlaki is the one who <unk> that operation before his two thousand and eleven death aqap said
past statements by the three main suspects claim allegiance to al qaeda or isis an <unk> answer because the two terror groups are considered rivals
both jihadist groups have an islamist <unk> however and it is possible that even if the suspects plotted together they may have been inspired by different groups
cherif and said kouachi are both said to have traveled to yemen
cherif before he was killed by police told cnn affiliate bfmtv that he'd trained in yemen with aqap
cherif kouachi used his <unk> passport to travel to yemen in two thousand and eleven two western intelligence sources with knowledge of the matter told cnn adding that it was likely he had trained with aqap there
a senior yemeni national security official told cnn that said had also entered yemen multiple times
coulibaly also called bfmtv before he was killed
he purportedly said by phone that he belonged to isis
that information hasn't been <unk> by authorities and it's not known whether he knew any leaders or members of that terrorist group
in the aftermath of the paris attacks his widow boumeddiene is believed to have fled to syria where isis operates
gunman tried to justify market raid to hostages recording apparently shows
terrorism experts say isis and al qaeda have an <unk> relationship so how are the self proclaimed al qaeda followers said and cherif kouachi linked to the self proclaimed isis member coulibaly
said kouachi's wife told investigators that her husband and coulibaly knew each other well
french court documents show that coulibaly and cherif kouachi were also close associates and plotted to stage a prison break to free a fellow terrorist in two thousand and ten
kouachi and coulibaly had a mentor in common a radical named djamel beghal
once known as al qaeda's premiere european recruiter beghal was convicted of conspiring to attack the u.s. embassy in paris
the attack was years in the making aqap claims and was <unk> as revenge for charlie hebdo's depictions of the prophet mohammed
al ansi blamed not only the satirical magazine but also france and the united states in his statement
it is france that has shared all of america's crimes al ansi added
it is france that has committed crimes in mali and the islamic maghreb
it is france that supports the <unk> of muslims in central africa in the name of race <unk>
u.s. officials told cnn it's believed that when cherif kouachi traveled to yemen in two thousand and eleven he returned carrying money from aqap <unk> to carry out the attack
investigators said the terrorist group could have given as much as twenty thousand dollar but the exact amount has not been verified
it is notable that aqap did not claim responsibility for the siege at the paris kosher grocery store where four hostages were killed along with gunman coulibaly
aqap praised the attack at the kosher grocery store calling it a blessing from allah that happened at the same time as the attack on charlie hebdo's office
<unk> name came to light in the paris attacks shortly after the kouachi brothers were identified
she was named a suspect together with her husband coulibaly
there were initial reports that she had fled after the kosher market attack but this was not confirmed and new evidence suggests that she was not in france at all during the attacks
but she could be a key to <unk> the details behind the attacks
authorities are looking into whether boumeddiene helped prepare the attacks before leaving france
boumeddiene arrived in turkey from madrid on january two five days before the first attack in paris turkey's <unk> news agency reports
boumeddiene stayed at an istanbul hotel and then traveled to syria on thursday <unk> said
the last place authorities spotted boumeddiene was somewhere near turkey's border with syria
a surveillance video image shows her at an istanbul airport with a man beside her
on tuesday france's le monde newspaper identified the man as <unk> <unk> describing him as someone known to french intelligence and who could have ties to a separate jihadist cell
<unk> brother the newspaper said was imprisoned last year for helping send fighters to afghanistan and pakistan
he was arrested near the border with turkey for allegedly kidnapping his son <unk> foreign ministry spokeswoman <unk> <unk> said
the ministry said that <unk> will remain in custody until at least january twenty when a court will consider second warrant related to terrorism charges
a <unk> prosecutor said the terrorism charge is regarding <unk> contacts with the kouachi brothers afp reported
the charges are for participation in an organized crime group whose aim was
terrorist acts the prosecutor said
it is unclear what <unk> contact with the kouachi brothers <unk>
as french officials dig deeper into the suspects behind the attacks they must deal with a new threat from an al qaeda affiliate
the affiliate in north africa the islamic maghreb published a threat against france on jihadist websites
france pays the cost of its violence on muslim countries and the violation of their <unk> the group said in its statement
as long as its soldiers occupy countries such as mali and central africa and <unk> our people in syria and iraq and as long as its lame media continues to undermine our prophet france will expose itself to the worst and more
the attack was years in the making an aqap leader said in a video claiming u.s. born cleric anwar al awlaki was the mastermind behind it
al awlaki was the terror group's spokesman before a u.s. drone strike killed him in yemen in two thousand and eleven
for days intelligence analysts have been trying to piece together whether the gunmen who attacked the magazine met him on trips to yemen a theory that could be <unk> by the new <unk> claim
aqap did not claim responsibility for friday's deadly siege at a kosher grocery store in paris but praised it
what is al qaeda in the arabian peninsula
french security services have identified a suspected accomplice in that attack according to the french newspaper le parisien
police sources cited by the newspaper said one line of investigation is that the accomplice a man from a paris suburb may have driven gunman amedy coulibaly to the kosher supermarket where coulibaly later shot dead four people
coulibaly was killed in a police raid to end the siege
said and cherif kouachi the brothers who authorities say were behind the charlie hebdo attack also are dead
but investigators efforts to track down possible suspects tied to last week's attacks are continuing
so is the magazine that the terrorists targeted last week
charlie hebdo's new edition hit <unk> wednesday a week after authorities say terrorists said and cherif kouachi burst into its newsroom and gunned down <unk>
the cover features a cartoon of the prophet mohammed crying
all three million copies sold out quickly but more copies are coming soon the magazine said
the claim of responsibility for the deadly attack on the magazine came in a video showing aqap commander nasr ibn ali al ansi with pictures of the <unk> in the background
when the heroes were assigned they accepted
they promised and fulfilled al ansi said
he praised the attack saying it was revenge for charlie hebdo's depictions of mohammed
al ansi blamed not only charlie hebdo but also france and the united states
it is france that has shared all of america's crimes al ansi added
it is france that has committed crimes in mali and the islamic maghreb
it is france that supports the <unk> of muslims in central africa in the name of race <unk>
it was a blessing from allah that the kosher market siege in which four hostages were killed took place about the same time al ansi said
u.s. authorities said they think the video is authentic
but they weren't ready to say that aqap helped carry out the assault
we're not there yet
there are good <unk> that the group was behind the attack but the intelligence community is still <unk> a senior administration official told cnn
earlier in the day u.s. national security council spokesman <unk> <unk> said that if genuine this is only the latest example of the <unk> brutality that is al qaeda's calling card and which it has visited upon <unk> of all faiths
investigators believe cherif kouachi left yemen with as much as twenty thousand dollar from aqap to carry out attacks a u.s. official said
le <unk> report said investigators identified coulibaly's suspected accomplice using keys for a <unk> discovered in an apartment they raided over the weekend
neighbors told cnn the apartment in the paris suburb of <unk> was raided saturday by police
also found inside the apartment according to le parisien
a <unk> of weapons explosives and two isis flags
coulibaly purportedly told authorities before he was killed that he belonged to isis
police also suspect the man may have been responsible for shooting and wounding a jogger last week an attack that the paris prosecutor has said could be tied to coulibaly because the ammunition used was the same as ammunition found at the scene of the kosher market attack le parisien said
paris police would not comment to cnn on the contents of the report
le parisien says coulibaly's accomplice who the newspaper did not name is suspected to have fled france possibly for syria
officials have also said they believe hayat boumeddiene coulibaly's widow who may have played a role in the attacks has fled to syria
with france on its highest level of alert ten thousand troops have deployed across the country
thousands of police officers are on patrol including hundreds assigned to protect jewish schools
since the attacks dozens of cases have been opened in france against people accused of expressing support for terrorism since the attacks the justice ministry said
it's unclear how many people are blamed for the fifty four <unk>
the cases include investigations involving phone threats cyberattacks and facebook posts the ministry said
some are in prison awaiting trial some have already been convicted and some have been released with a notice of a court date ministry spokesman pierre <unk> said
<unk> for the alleged crimes <unk> <unk> said
justice minister christiane <unk> considers that words or actions of a <unk> or anti semitic nature or that cause <unk> violent or <unk> behavior or advocate terrorism or target security forces must be fought and pursued with the utmost <unk> her office said in a statement
she asked prosecutors to exercise extreme <unk> in the conduct of public action against the perpetrators of such crimes the statement said
with concerns on the rise a controversial french comedian was accused of publicly supporting terrorism french media reported
<unk> m'bala m'bala known as <unk> was arrested in paris according to media reports which tied his arrest to a recent facebook post from the comedian
je suis charlie coulibaly the post said combined the last name of one of the terrorists involved in last week's attacks with the widely used phrase expressing solidarity with victims
that post has since been <unk>
<unk> has previously been fined several times in france for anti semitic commentary
last year the french government said it wanted to ban his live <unk>
and british authorities banned him from entering the united kingdom
on monday <unk> issued a statement with his stance on the terror attacks
since the beginning of last year i have been treated as public enemy number one when all i try to do is make people laugh and laugh about death he wrote in a letter to the french interior minister
because death <unk> at us all as charlie knows now unfortunately
after his release from custody wednesday his lawyer told france's <unk> network that the comedian returned to performing his act at a theater in the same paris neighborhood where charlie hebdo's offices are located
the man was traveling in the <unk>
it was early in the morning
he doesn't remember how he fell
<unk> another cruise the <unk> magic saw him said <unk> port captain <unk> <unk>
the lucky man a twenty two year old u.s. citizen had been in the water for about five hours during last thursday's ordeal rodriguez said
at seven thirty one a.m. a passenger aboard <unk> magic reported a man in the water
the passenger had thrown multiple <unk> in the water to help him said rodriguez
they rescued him and gave him medical attention
the man was taken to a local hospital and was in good condition before he was flown back to the united states rodriguez said
this man was <unk>
most people that experience that kind of fall break their neck
it's like hitting concrete he said
david hearn a <unk> magic passenger recorded the rescue
in his video a yellow rescue boat <unk> on dark ocean waters and a man's head and arms are barely visible above the waves
the man then <unk> toward the boat and is brought aboard
we were in our <unk>
on the speaker system we heard the crew saying <unk> m o b <unk> side
i got dressed and went up to the upper deck hearn said
m o b is the code used for man overboard
when hearn reached the <unk> upper deck the ship's crew had already <unk> the <unk>
it was pretty surreal at first
it's not something you expect when you go on a nice cruise hearn said
our first question was where did he come from
we thought it was someone that fell off our ship
hearn said he spoke to the passenger credited with spotting the man in the water
his daughter had gotten up and they had a room with a <unk>
she wanted to sit out there and he went with her hearn recalled
they heard a noise and as the ship got closer they realized it was a man screaming for help
they got on the phone with guest services and the ship came to a stop
royal caribbean closed circuit tv video showed the man was alone on the <unk> ship deck five when he went overboard at six seven a.m
there were no other guests or crew around at the time said <unk> martinez a royal caribbean spokeswoman
cnn's request for the video was denied
<unk> of the seas is one of the world's largest ships with room for more than eight thousand passengers and crew
it had <unk> from port <unk> florida on january three and <unk> was the last port of call martinez said
the ship's safety features include a minimum safety <unk> of forty two <unk> and more than one thousand two hundred security cameras
for their safety we <unk> that guests not <unk> over or climb on any <unk> said martinez
but miami based maritime lawyer jim <unk> says these measures are not enough
instead he advocates automatic man overboard detection systems
this poor guy was pretty lucky
the real issues is why he fell off the ship and why there is no clear explanation <unk> said
automatic man overboard detection technology uses radar and sensors to establish a perimeter around a ship
a <unk> <unk> the crew when a person has fallen overboard
one <unk> of these systems <unk> <unk> a ninety five percents man overboard detection rate
the cruise vessel safety and security act requires large passenger ships to <unk> technology that can be used for capturing images of passengers or <unk> passengers who have fallen overboard to the extent that such technology is available
unlike this incident <unk> said the problem with most man overboard cases is that the person is never found and the case goes <unk>
there are some people who commit suicide he said
the <unk> are easily detected because the person leaves a message or doesn't bring any <unk> onto the ship or they sell their homes et <unk>
but there are a whole group of cases that don't fall on the suicide pattern
there are other cases which we suspect are a result of <unk> play
it is a magazine cover depicting the prophet mohammed with a tear falling from his cheek holding a sign that says je suis charlie the slogan that became a worldwide <unk>
above mohammed are the words all is forgiven
on wednesday two muslim extremists attacked the offices of charlie hebdo a french magazine with a history of mocking mohammed
twelve were killed including several top editors by two men with terrorist connections who said they were avenging the prophet
many muslims object to any depictions of mohammed respectful or not saying that such images <unk> his teachings and lead to <unk>
for the secular <unk> at charlie hebdo neither of those concerns seemed to matter much
they often <unk> mohammed <unk> <unk> him as a <unk> <unk> figure
it's not surprising that in its first issue since the attack charlie hebdo again put mohammed on the cover
but this time instead of showing the prophet in an <unk> light the magazine struck a far different tone and was received by some muslims in a far different way
my initial thought is that the cover is a near perfect response to the tragedy said hussein <unk> a professor of islamic thought at <unk> university in new york
they are not backing down from the depiction of mohammed <unk> their free speech rights
at the same time the message is conciliatory humble and will hopefully reduce the anger directed to the muslim communities of france
<unk> el <unk> a columnist at charlie hebdo magazine who worked on the new issue told the bbc that the staff didn't want to express hatred toward the terrorists who killed her colleagues
the that happened in france after this horrible crime must open the door to forgiveness
everyone must think about this forgiveness
chosen by charlie hebdo's editors on monday night the cover was released by liberation the french newspaper that is sharing its office space with <unk> from the satirical magazine
many media outlets have <unk> the cover in a show of solidarity
the issue will hit <unk> this wednesday in a flood of three million copies translated into multiple languages
as the new cover <unk> across social media muslims responded with a mix of emotions from <unk> to appreciation from <unk> to <unk>
<unk> <unk> ibrahim an imam in australia <unk> his one hundred thousand facebook followers to follow the example of mohammed even if they encounter images that they believe are <unk>
as it is clear that the cartoons are to be published again muslims will <unk> be hurt and angered but our reaction must be a reflection of the teachings of the one we love and are angered for ibrahim said
<unk> patience tolerance <unk> and mercy was the character of our beloved prophet
on twitter some muslims were skeptical that publishing an image that many consider offensive should be <unk> as an act of solidarity
other muslims said they appreciate the magazine's sentiments
<unk> noted that the <unk> central message forgiveness <unk> not only throughout islam but through other faiths as well
the cover is a call to our better <unk> and an <unk> that religion also offers good to the world
other muslim leaders criticized the cover
that the depiction appears <unk> is of little <unk> because it will be seen as offensive and deliberately provocative said <unk> <unk> executive director of the <unk> <unk> of the council on american islamic relations
there's nothing in the quran islam's primary text about depicting the prophet
but according to the <unk> stories and <unk> attributed to mohammed and his companions he <unk> muslims from making images of him
<unk> said that charlie hebdo's new cover will <unk> many but noted that over ninety nine point nine nine nine percents of france's five million muslims acted <unk> when the previous depiction was released
<unk> qadhi an american cleric with a wide following said he's not pleased by any depictions of mohammed but it's clear that this hebdo cover unlike others is not meant to make fun of muslims
qadhi also said that while he respects the right to free speech there appears to be a double standard when it comes to what western society and hebdo find <unk> for mocking
did you happen to notice any cartoons mocking the death of the cartoonists themselves and lampooning their work and efforts
qadhi asked
satire of the type attempted by charlie hebdo often serves a valuable end said <unk> safi director of islamic studies at duke university
but safi <unk> the french magazine for <unk> in its choice of targets
i see satire as always having a purpose of mocking the powers that be <unk> power <unk> <unk>
so who are we speaking power to today
safi said
sure violent terrorists
but what about all the other agents of violence including the state sponsored ones
that's why i don't find charlie hebdo particularly good satire
many muslims seemed content not to comment on hebdo's latest depiction of their prophet or to pay it no mind
let us ignore the <unk> and <unk> and get about the work of being a source of good and mercy to all we may come into contact with imam <unk> <unk> a popular cleric and scholar from california posted on facebook this week
may allah <unk> you all and make things easy for you and your families during these trying times
<unk> groups are asking the predominantly sunni muslim nation to <unk> its stance toward atheists after authorities arrested a student and sentenced him to three years in prison for facebook posts that insulted islam
<unk> <unk> mohamed al <unk> was arrested with a group of people at a cafe in november according to the association for freedom of thought and expression
an egyptian minor offenses court sentenced him on blasphemy charges saturday in what human rights watch called part of a wider government push to combat <unk> and other forms of dissent
atheists are one of egypt's least protected minorities although the constitution <unk> <unk> freedom of belief and expression said sarah <unk> <unk> <unk> middle east and north africa director
egyptian authorities need to be guided by the constitution and stop <unk> people for <unk>
while article sixty four of egypt's constitution says freedom of belief is absolute it also says freedom to practice religious <unk> or establish houses of worship is exclusive to judaism christianity islam the <unk> faith and other <unk> religions
according to french press agency reports cited by hrw a researcher with the egyptian initiative for personal rights said a local newspaper identified al <unk> as an <unk> and al <unk> lawyer reported that the <unk> own father <unk> that he was <unk> extremist ideas
among al <unk> posts are a split image of a severely <unk> woman and a quran with the caption it's ok to burn a woman
but it's not ok to burn a book
something is wrong with your priorities
another post carries the caption a big reward to whoever represents islam and shows several caricatures of bearded men in similar dress pointing at each other saying this person does not represent islam
a judge will hear al <unk> appeal on march nine and his bail has been set at one thousand egyptian pounds his lawyer told the french press agency
hrw says that blasphemy cases generally <unk> from personal or unrelated <unk> and since the country's two thousand and eleven uprising authorities have increasingly investigated complaints
while most of the cases involve alleged <unk> to islam hrw says that at least two men have been imprisoned for insulting christianity
authorities have also been targeting atheists of late according to hrw
police in december shut down a cairo cafe popular with suspected atheists and district administrative chief <unk> <unk> told a news outlet that the shop was <unk> and <unk> known as a place for <unk> worship <unk> and <unk> hrw reported
also last month the <unk> al <unk> which issues religious <unk> in egypt released a survey claiming egypt had eight hundred and sixty six atheists more than any other middle eastern country
two aides to the grand <unk> who heads <unk> al <unk> and is the country's top official on religious laws told a newspaper that the increase in <unk> should ring alarm <unk>
this follows a march promise from a top <unk> security official to arrest atheists and a june announcement by egypt's youth and religious <unk> <unk> that they would confront <unk>
editor's note
sarah <unk> <unk> is the director of the middle east and north africa division at human rights watch
follow on twitter <unk> one
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author
<unk> <unk> their hands about how to <unk> the spread of extremist religious <unk> that <unk> western targets but also muslims and non muslim minorities in the middle east who are <unk> primary victims
where are some muslims getting the idea that violence against journalists who <unk> them is ok
why do they see beheadings as a <unk> punishment
a good place to look for answers would be to examine saudi arabia's policies of intolerance and extremism
king abdullah as the <unk> of islam's most sacred religious sites and leader of saudi arabia is widely considered an important role model for muslims around the world
so it should not come as a surprise that many muslims take their <unk> from the country on the <unk> and punishments they consider appropriate to <unk> on those who challenge or <unk> with their <unk> of islam
saudi arabia gave a good indication of its position on appropriate punishments last friday when it carried out round one of a public flogging fifty lashes against raif badawi a young <unk> in front of the al <unk> mosque in jeddah
a saudi court had fined badawi and sentenced him in two thousand and fourteen to one thousand lashes over twenty <unk> and to ten years in prison for the crime of insulting islam in part for setting up a liberal website to debate various topics including religion
badawi is not the only saudi who has faced punishment for his perceived views
the government has jailed many leading <unk> writers and activists who have <unk> to question any <unk> of the <unk> imposed by the country's <unk> religious leaders
a former colleague of badawi <unk> al <unk> was jailed in late two thousand and fourteen on charges of insulting the <unk> and the <unk> in connection with tweets that allegedly criticized religious authorities
in october a saudi court sentenced a shiite cleric <unk> al <unk> to death for criticizing the government and breaking allegiance with the ruler
the prosecutor had sought what the saudis call a <unk> sentence the kingdom's <unk> in which the convicted person is beheaded and the <unk> body displayed in public
there is so much shock and outrage about isis propaganda <unk> showing its beheadings of journalists in iraq and syria and most recently the reported beheadings of two tunisian journalists in libya
but the much more routine and widespread beheadings by saudi arabia get little scrutiny and condemnation
saudi arabia beheaded at least twenty six people last august alone
the eighty two executions in two thousand and fourteen make saudi arabia a world leader in capital punishment
saudi interior ministry news releases indicate that about half of them were for <unk> crimes the other half for drug offenses and one for <unk>
yes you read that right
in two thousand and fourteen saudi arabia was still beheading people for <unk>
so is it really any surprise that extremist groups also acting in the name of islam seem to be following <unk> lead <unk> out their own severe punishments against journalists and activists they find offensive
if saudi arabia thinks publicly beheading people <unk> with islamic religious teachings and <unk> those who also might want to criticize them or question their religion why shouldn't isis
one might argue that a nation unlike some self designated islamic caliphate has the legitimacy and authority to exercise state sponsored violence including against its own citizens
but countries also have <unk> to respect human rights
saudi arabia's <unk> prosecutions and cruel punishments <unk> these <unk> and undermine its own legitimacy
there is probably little governments and <unk> can do to influence the ideology of extremist armed groups
but there's a lot more they can and should do to influence the policies and practices of purported allies in the war on terror
that includes the anti isis coalition to which saudi arabia and many other <unk> <unk> and deeply <unk> arab governments belong
while the united states and united kingdom governments statements condemning badawi's flogging were a good start more often these countries are <unk> silent in the face of saudi arabia's <unk> abuses against its own citizens
the <unk> <unk> of isis abuses have less credibility when governments carrying out similar abuses if much smaller in scale and magnitude are good <unk> strong allies and important investors
if the international community is serious about taking on islamist extremist <unk> if it wants to see real models of tolerance respect for diverse <unk> religious freedom and the free and peaceful exchange of ideas it must urge king abdullah to be the true <unk> of the rights of muslims around the world
for a start he can <unk> the sentence against badawi and release dozens of detained activists and writers
he could even <unk> beheadings overnight if that is what he wanted
at that demonstration some muslims held signs that not only echoed the rallying cry je suis charlie but also proclaimed je suis <unk>
the public <unk> was especially <unk> at a time when the two communities are so often <unk> against one another
but on the same day that brought this and other messages of hope the jewish agency for israel reported that hundreds of french jews attended an information fair in paris held under tight security to explore immigration to israel
though the event had been scheduled before last week's terror attacks the <unk> suggested that for some french jews this unity rally may have come too late
<unk> about a half million the jewish community in france is the largest in europe and third largest in the world after israel and the united states
rising anti semitism in recent years however has <unk> away at the numbers
seven thousand french jews moved to israel in two thousand and fourteen according to the jewish agency
that number more than <unk> the previous year's figure and for the first time more jews moved to israel from france than they did from any other country
the attack on the kosher market friday came during a manhunt for suspects in the killing of twelve at the satirical french magazine charlie hebdo two days earlier
four died in the market making it the deadliest attack on french jews in nearly three years
in march two thousand and twelve a teacher and three students were gunned down at a jewish school in <unk>
like the victims of the supermarket shooting the <unk> victims were also buried in israel
the practice of being buried there is a matter of faith not <unk> cnn reported at the time and especially meaningful to those who are religiously <unk>
the <unk> of paris which represents jewish communities said in two thousand and twelve that forty percents of practicing french jews <unk> for burial in israel
before the friday siege at the market even ended jewish businesses in the area were <unk> and paris largest synagogue the <unk> synagogue was closed for <unk> services for the first time since world war ii
the violence came after a year <unk> by unsettling developments in france a <unk> of them listed by <unk> an online jewish magazine
among the anti semitic incidents were reports of jewish teens who wore traditional jewish items like <unk> being assaulted with <unk> tear gas and <unk> spray
a jewish teacher leaving a kosher restaurant in paris was attacked his nose broken and a <unk> drawn on his chest
two teens and their grandfather were <unk> by a group including a man wielding an <unk> as they walked to synagogue in paris
two french teenage girls plotted to blow up a synagogue in <unk>
a kosher restaurant in paris was <unk>
a kosher supermarket was set <unk> in <unk>
a man shook a <unk> baby <unk> at a bus stop in paris and said to her dirty <unk> enough with your children already
between january and the end of july of two thousand and fourteen the most recent data available there were about six hundred and twenty anti semitic incidents in france a ninety one percents increase over the year before said <unk> <unk> <unk> the paris director of the american jewish committee a global jewish advocacy agency
the sad reality she added is that most of these anti semitic acts were committed by disenfranchised muslims
but this <unk> is the result of two <unk> developments in france said <unk> <unk> a global affairs analyst for cnn
in conversation with cnn's jim <unk> <unk> pointed to the rise of the extreme right political party of marine le pen which is openly <unk> and to the rise of islamic <unk>
flames of hatred were further fueled by israel's operation in gaza over the summer
anti israel demonstrations <unk> into a new level of <unk>
about four hundred jews gathered in july to pray for peace at paris <unk> <unk> <unk> synagogue
they found themselves trapped inside for hours as demonstrators <unk> death to the jews a witness outside the synagogue told cnn
some of the jews inside heard <unk> of jews to the <unk> and saw men brandishing <unk> and broken <unk>
the level of danger is very new <unk> <unk> the synagogue president who was inside that day told cnn afterward
today and tomorrow for the jewish people in france is fully different from what it was yesterday
that was half a year ago
what lies ahead may look even more different
last week's three day siege by islamist terrorists left seventeen dead in and around paris
a policewoman was killed after the attack at the offices of charlie hebdo
the killings at the kosher market came as jews <unk> in preparation for <unk>
and while the last attack was deemed obviously anti semitic one death at charlie hebdo may have been too
on friday cnn's <unk> <unk> spoke to <unk> <unk> the cousin of <unk> cayat the only woman killed at the magazine
other women were specifically told by the attackers that they would be spared because they were women and <unk> believes cayat was not because she was jewish
<unk> had spoken to <unk> brother the night before and learned that cayat a <unk> and columnist had been receiving anonymous phone calls
they included threats like dirty jew you should stop working for charlie hebdo
otherwise we're going to kill you she told <unk>
the press hasn't really talked about it that way here
it was only about freedom of speech that was attacked and my feeling was that religion was there too she said
and today the kosher market siege unfortunately seemed to prove that i wasn't totally wrong
perhaps if france had acted more <unk> when only jews were the targets of islamist violence this never would have happened some said on social media
others <unk> if there was a future for jews in france
some <unk> the famous nazi <unk> <unk> of german <unk> <unk> martin <unk> in sentiments such as first they came for the jews but i did not speak out because i wasn't a jew
then they came for the journalists
conspiracy theories blaming jews and israel for the charlie hebdo attack that killed <unk> cousin are already making the rounds the anti <unk> league reported
the organization listed a <unk> of accusations being made in the u.s. and abroad a number of them pointing fingers at the israeli intelligence agency <unk>
the tunisia times the <unk> said ran an article friday that read the <unk> hired muslims from arabic <unk> to carry the attack to increase <unk> towards muslims worldwide
by sunday morning a makeshift memorial outside the kosher market drew crowds
members of the jewish community prayed and others came declaring je suis <unk> to show support
also on hand and shaking hands with parisian jews was <unk> <unk> the controversial right wing leader of the jewish home party in israel cnn's <unk> <unk> reported
like other israeli politicians in recent days including prime minister benjamin netanyahu he shared the message that israel is home to any jews who want to move there
if they decide to come to israel we will accept them and embrace them he said
if they decide to stay here we will continue to make sure they're secure
the world has to wake up
several people in the crowd told cnn they planned to leave
the jewish community is no longer safe said one man
i will leave for israel a young woman said because unfortunately now here i'm afraid
later on sunday after the unity rally the <unk> synagogue filled for a memorial service
seated two rows behind israel's prime minister was soviet born <unk> <unk> who was sentenced in one thousand nine hundred and seventy seven to forced labor in a <unk> prison camp or <unk>
what landed him there for nine years was his human rights <unk> and <unk> on making <unk> or moving to israel
today the israeli politician activist and author his books include fear no evil the case for democracy and defending identity is the chairman of the jewish agency
while seven thousand french jews made <unk> in two thousand and fourteen he recently told the jerusalem post that fifty thousand had <unk> about it
and while a year ago information <unk> about immigration to israel were held once a month in france he said they are now held twice a day
here you have for the first time a clear thing <unk> told the newspaper
there is a massive exodus from a community in the free world which has all the doors open to them and they are choosing israel
evidence of french jews moving to israel can be seen in <unk> a <unk> community where an art center is <unk> after the <unk> and conversations at cafes are more likely to be in french than <unk> reported cnn's <unk> lee
high rise apartment buildings are under construction in <unk> and a <unk> told lee that since august the majority of buyers have come from france
a woman named catherine who only wanted to use her first name arrived two weeks ago
she told lee that friends and family would soon follow
the french government they say to us we don't want you to go she said in broken english
but they don't do nothing that makes us stay
the <unk> of jews in france however are not ready to give up on their country said <unk> <unk> vice president of the french union of jewish students
some people want to leave
this is their choice <unk> told cnn's jim <unk>
but this is a minority
the majority of french jews are in france
they love this country and they want to stay here
it's why they too rallied in solidarity with the masses on sunday
they'd like to remember how a muslim employee at the kosher supermarket helped saved jews
they know a threat to them is also a threat to democracy
they point to <unk> up security as evidence of how seriously their home country is looking out for them
about four thousand seven hundred officers have been tasked with securing seven hundred and seventeen jewish schools french prime minister manuel valls told cnn affiliate bfmtv
valls doesn't want jews to leave
france he's even said depends on their staying
the choice was made by the french revolution in one thousand seven hundred and eighty nine to recognize jews as full citizens valls told the <unk> jeffrey <unk> before last week
to understand what the idea of the republic is about you have to understand the central role played by the <unk> of the jews
it is a founding principle
so if jews were to leave en <unk> the french republic would be <unk> a failure he said
if one hundred thousand french people of spanish origin were to leave i would never say that france is not france anymore said valls whom <unk> noted is the son of spanish immigrants
but if one hundred thousand jews leave france will no longer be france
while some people have left and perhaps more will <unk> <unk> the paris <unk> director is not <unk> about a mass exodus which she called <unk>
she'd rather wait to see if france will do everything it can to make jews feel safe
i'm more worried about the state of mind of people who are in france and asking themselves if they have a future here she told cnn by phone late monday
it affects the way they live in this country
if they feel <unk> or <unk> from france that would signal trouble
jews are totally <unk> with what the french republic is about she said
french jews are french and they want to continue living in the country
in fact when jews go to synagogue she said they offer up a special prayer
it is a prayer for the republic the place that for centuries has been their home

but in the last few weeks a <unk> <unk> bunch of <unk> throw <unk> not <unk> their own words who didn't just take on the english football establishment but <unk> their way through it haven't stopped talking about what went on in their dressing room
<unk> in their <unk> of the crazy gang wimbledon's remarkable team in the one thousand nine hundred and eighty s <unk> little for either rules or <unk>
at wimbledon you got tied up naked and dragged through <unk> or maybe someone <unk> your car and drove it away to hide it or your shoes would get <unk> to the top of a seat terry <unk> a former player told cnn
or they would burn your clothes cut your clothes or your tie off or if you left your hotel key when you were out of a hotel you'd come back and your room would be <unk>
though <unk> for their long ball style the small south london club achieved a rise in english football that was <unk> fast
in one thousand nine hundred and seventy seven the <unk> club entered the english football league starting in the fourth division
nine years later they were briefly top of what is today's premier league after a <unk> run of four <unk> in five <unk>
better was to come as the <unk> cats then defeated english football's <unk> in one of the fa <unk> greatest <unk> as wimbledon beat liverpool dubbed the culture club by one commentator in the one thousand nine hundred and eighty eight final
although a <unk> of players would go on to both bigger clubs and international careers there was one <unk> factor behind wimbledon's success
we've got the team spirit to carry us through replied future england international <unk> wise when asked about the prospect of beating liverpool described that day by a bbc television <unk> as <unk> the greatest post war club we've seen in the one thousand nine hundred and eighty eight fa cup final
a variety of elements such as hard work tactics team discipline an early use of video data and in the final itself a <unk> of good fortune <unk> wimbledon's success but unity was the key
this was achieved by <unk> exercises that seem routine now but which were far from <unk> then such as army <unk> camps but others believe the <unk> was <unk> in an altogether less <unk> environment
we ruled by fear it was wonderful former <unk> john <unk> wimbledon's self proclaimed leader said in a controversial documentary broadcast by british television channel bt sport last month
<unk> said he dragged a <unk> by his <unk> while he also spoke of players being locked in car boots or being forced to go two days without eating
then among <unk> <unk> there were the regular fights that broke out often involving <unk> a black belt in <unk>
on the pitch there was <unk> as well there were the injuries suffered by opponents players most notably <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and manchester <unk> <unk> anderson in the stadium <unk> after the game as wimbledon's aggressive style and warrior <unk> <unk> <unk> over
even more famous is a near iconic image of jones <unk> paul <unk> private parts as he tried to <unk> <unk> one thousand nine hundred and ninety world cup star
the culture at any club depends on the manager chief executive and owner as they tend to set the culture sports <unk> <unk> <unk> told cnn
wimbledon's owner at the time lebanese <unk> sam <unk> was and still is <unk> to say the least
he realized that jesus had twelve <unk> and all were very different <unk> told bt sport
sam was like jesus in our mind almost because he was a real leader
despite knowing little about football <unk> bought the club on a <unk> and was soon <unk> his unusual <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that players would have to sit through opera if they lost by four goals while he once made coach <unk> <unk> eat <unk> <unk> <unk> as a way of being persuaded that he really wanted to buy a certain player
the whole time sam <unk> was there he encouraged us not to <unk> or be <unk> but to be different and strong with each other <unk> <unk> who came through wimbledon's youth system before making his <unk> aged eighteen in one thousand nine hundred and ninety one told cnn
<unk> is now manager of <unk> wimbledon whose fa cup defeat by liverpool on january twelve <unk> memories of years gone by
several claims in the bt sport program have angered many of the other personnel involved who have dismissed the <unk> as wild <unk> particularly the most serious account where a wimbledon player jones says a <unk> was so badly beaten in a <unk> room fight that his badly torn <unk> muscle needed twenty thirty <unk>
it has since been dismissed as a <unk> <unk> gone wrong by fa cup winner terry <unk>
would any other <unk> even a football club have <unk> what went on at wimbledon
the first thing i'd think about was getting down to the <unk> and getting away from it having a drink <unk> john <unk> who joined in one thousand nine hundred and eighty seven told bt sport
i remember getting in the car and getting <unk> up for training so i would be able to cope for it
i had to adapt and i <unk> it took six months but it made me into the person i am added <unk> who joined alongside <unk> and would play at the one thousand nine hundred and ninety four world cup for the republic of ireland
i'm not going to name them but i saw <unk> tears in their eyes and breaking down who couldn't handle it
but can fear really <unk> a dressing room
of course says <unk> <unk>
any team dynamic can be complex and there is more than one way
but a culture of fear is very explosive and if that was <unk> it would have helped some players but hindered others
a culture of fears normally means things are out of control
between two thousand and seven and two thousand and thirteen <unk> <unk> worked as assistant coach to manchester <unk> sir <unk> ferguson famed for his <unk> <unk> <unk> where he would <unk> players from close range in the dressing room
it's not fear but respect ultimate respect the <unk> told cnn
if you want the best time and time again you have to push people and push boundaries
the reason <unk> do it is because they know it's in those players
i'm sure ninety nine point nine nine percents of those players if asked would say the manager got the best out of them
the <unk> also believes the wimbledon <unk> first <unk> <unk> and then fa cup winning coach <unk> were fully aware of what they were doing
i was the <unk> of the worst <unk> school in the whole of england <unk> told bt sport
every morning you were going to walk in and there was going to be a problem
we spent pre season training at various army training camps around england and europe <unk> wrote in an <unk> wimbledon match program as he <unk> <unk> much of the bt sport claims
they were tough <unk> days but i wanted to build <unk> make players feel at ease in different <unk>
i also wanted <unk>
it's up to the manager to allow the players some control added <unk>
these players can keep the dressing room at the right temperature
take the relationship between sam <unk> and <unk> <unk> or jose <unk> and john terry they are the guys that pull the dressing room together he said referring to the west <unk> and <unk> <unk> and their <unk> <unk>
one former wimbledon player says it's wrong to single out the club for treatment even if the players did once strip him naked and leave him to run three miles back to the training ground
i didn't take that as <unk> that was a practical joke germany's <unk> <unk> told cnn
we were going for a run in the park and it was a bit cold but to have been <unk> naked and have to run back it was more fun than anything else
but there were lots of practical jokes that were not so funny almost wrong like <unk> in someone's <unk> bottle especially with my long hair
i think these kinds of practical jokes wouldn't happen anymore but it worked a little bit then he explained
it was part of the culture that people took the <unk> out of each other that people pushed each other on the field to perform so it was a much closer connection between some of the players but these days those sorts of things are not accepted said <unk>
<unk> who has played on all the world's <unk> says he found the culture of wimbledon's dressing room leaders <unk> elsewhere
in brazil the way the older players were treating the younger players was just as hard as at wimbledon
it was very difficult for the <unk> in brazil to <unk>
in some ways it was just too much
many times an older player slapped a younger player
let's put it this way when i was younger the typical way of having respect for the older guys was much greater than now says <unk> who believes the changes came about in the early two thousand s
now a younger player will tell an older player to f off
but in that time whether in wimbledon or germany or brazil if you got off on the wrong foot <unk> or showed <unk> to someone it was a problem
but it's not just football where respect for the elder has changed as it's happened in offices and businesses all over the world
as a manager <unk> is well aware that in the twenty one st century different rules now apply in dressing rooms
in the past young players were hungry they used to have to do jobs stand up and be counted and deal with everything thrown at them
now you've got young <unk> who want everything done for them
<unk> in football have created a much better environment training facilities and <unk> quality but they <unk> them too much
but players at fourteen get treated like first team players
we're trying to get the right mix we want our players to have the best <unk> and facilities but we also want that hunger
the forty two year old <unk> is intent on <unk> a <unk> <unk> in his players
we want a <unk> environment and we're trying to change for the better to do that
but it's a fine line when trying to fire up a <unk> between getting him to perform and getting him to <unk> up
<unk> a lot <unk> today but also a lot weaker not as tough as it was twenty years ago
there is so much political <unk> around that we have to be <unk> not to <unk> our next generation to the point where they haven't got the character to make it to the top
the documents show that amedy coulibaly and cherif kouachi were close associates and go into <unk> detail on how the two paris attackers plotted to stage a prison break to free a fellow terrorist in two thousand and ten
coulibaly who is accused of killing a french police officer and killing four more people at a kosher grocery store was described as a logistics expert in charge of <unk> weapons and arms for the prison break plot
records show when he was arrested in two thousand and ten police found a huge <unk> of high <unk> arms including two hundred and forty <unk> for machine guns for the specific goal of seriously hurting people through <unk> or terror acts
police also found computers with security and <unk> and <unk> for poison purportedly capable of killing a million people
cherif kouachi accused of killing twelve people after attacking the charlie hebdo magazine last week with his brother was <unk> in the prison plot but he denied involvement and was not jailed for that
kouachi and coulibaly had a mentor in common a radical named djamel beghal
once known as al qaeda's premiere european recruiter beghal was convicted of conspiring to attack the u.s. embassy in paris
kouachi had met beghal in prison and once they were freed he would visit him with coulibaly bringing beghal food and money and sometimes spending days at his apartment
also part of the visits was coulibaly's partner hayat boumeddiene who's now on the run and wanted by police
court documents detail how kouachi and coulibaly plotted together hiding their conversations by using code names over <unk> cell phones
but what about beghal
does he have any direct connection to last week's attacks
and what happened to him
beghal was first arrested in dubai in two thousand and one for his role in the embassy plot
he was in custody until his trial and conviction in two thousand and five then released on house arrest in two thousand and nine
after beghal's release french authorities collected more than forty five thousand pages of wire <unk> and surveillance images of him including when he was under house arrest
the images include a two thousand and ten photo of beghal with cherif kouachi and two other men in a park
and a second photo also taken in two thousand and ten is of beghal with coulibaly who visited the recruiter in <unk> france with boumeddiene
a western intelligence source verified the authenticity of the images obtained by cnn
beghal's time out of prison didn't last long
in two thousand and ten he was arrested and charged with involvement in same prison break plot that landed coulibaly in prison
he was sentenced to twelve years in prison and remains behind bars
beghal's ties to al qaeda stretch back before the nine eleven attacks in the united states against the world trade center and the pentagon the source said
in november two thousand beghal traveled to afghanistan for eight months also visiting pakistan
according to court records he was put in charge of the plot to blow up the u.s. embassy in paris an attack <unk> similar to the one thousand nine hundred and ninety eight attacks against u.s. embassies in kenya and tanzania
the western intelligence source says beghal was given instructions to go to dubai and then morocco where he would lose his old passport and get a new one
he was then <unk> to travel to spain where he would be given the equivalent of sixty thousand dollar to carry out the paris attack on the u.s. embassy
but <unk> was stopped and questioned as he passed through dubai
according to the western intelligence source he confessed during interrogation to the planned attack on the embassy
he was ultimately convicted in a french court
u.s. authorities never brought charges against the french algerian as they did other al qaeda operatives involved in one thousand nine hundred and ninety eight attacks on u.s. embassies in east africa
beghal's mentor was <unk> park mosque cleric abu <unk> al <unk> convicted just last week on terrorism charges and sentenced to life by a federal judge in new york
abu <unk> is believed to have radicalized and influenced convicted terrorists <unk> bomber richard <unk> and nine <unk> <unk> <unk>

the three terrorists who carried out last week's attacks killing seventeen people in the course of three days of fear have been linked to the islamist extremist groups isis and al qaeda
two of them brothers said and cherif kouachi who stormed the offices of charlie hebdo said they were acting to avenge the prophet mohammed
the magazine has previously published controversial images of the prophet seen as blasphemy by muslims and it's been revealed that the cover of the new edition to be published wednesday drawn by the attack survivors will again feature a cartoon of mohammed
with some three million copies set to be distributed there's <unk> for an angry reaction from those who see it as deeply offensive
but in his statement <unk> urged the muslim community to remain calm and avoid an emotional reaction all the while <unk> the freedom of opinion
many french muslims turned out in paris and elsewhere for huge national unity <unk> sunday keen to show they shared in the nation's horror and <unk> at the events of last week
some held <unk> saying je suis <unk> or i am jewish as a sign of solidarity with the four jewish people killed in the supermarket attack <unk> up on the widely embraced slogan je suis charlie
one young muslim woman named <unk> who held a sign declaring both statements as she marched told cnn that the killings were not down to religion
it is very important for me because as you can see jews and muslims shouldn't be enemies and they should refuse to be enemies she said
as a muslim <unk> said she had cried when she learned that so many people had been killed
here in france it is very very very difficult to live when you are muslim because they always think you are a terrorist
and when i heard that again muslims killed people because they were not ok with what they said i was totally <unk> and i was very sad she said
one of the twelve victims in the charlie hebdo attack was police officer ahmed merabet a french muslim of algerian descent
at a national ceremony in paris french president franois hollande <unk> him alongside two other slain officers franck brinsolaro and <unk> jean philippe <unk> each the legion <unk>
<unk> brother <unk> told reporters that ahmed had been proud of his name proud to be a police officer and proud to defend the values of the french republic
he was killed by false muslims said <unk> merabet warning of the dangers of a wider backlash against those who share his faith
i address myself now to all the <unk> <unk> and anti <unk> he said
one must not <unk> extremists with muslims
mad people have neither color or religion
i want to make another point
don't <unk> everybody with the same brush don't burn mosques or synagogues
you are attacking people
it won't bring our dead back and it won't <unk> the families
when governments try to <unk> favor with <unk> eventually the <unk> take the law into their own hands
in pakistan jihadis have killed dozens of people whom they accuse of blasphemy including a brave <unk> <unk> who <unk> to call the blasphemy law a black law
we should fight the paris terrorists
but we should also fight the source of the problem
it's not enough for muslim leaders to condemn people who kill those they consider as <unk> if their own governments <unk> the idea of <unk> blasphemy at the very same time
the u.s. religious freedom commission and the u.n. human rights committee have both declared that blasphemy laws <unk> universal human rights because they <unk> freedom of speech and expression
they are correct
editor's note
<unk> <unk> is a world affairs columnist for the miami herald and world politics review
a former cnn producer and correspondent she is the author of the end of revolution
a changing world in the age of live television
follow her on twitter <unk>
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author
murdoch the conservative media <unk> never afraid to <unk> liberal <unk> tweeted that muslims must be held responsible for their growing jihadist cancer
<unk> the creator of harry <unk> deployed her <unk> <unk>
i was born christian she tweeted back
if that makes <unk> murdoch my responsibility i'll <unk> <unk>
at last count more than twenty thousand people had re tweeted her
the comedian <unk> <unk> shot back <unk> can we get a step by step guide
how can my sixty year old parents in <unk> help destroy terrorist groups
<unk> <unk>
there are few subjects as sensitive as easy to get wrong as the role of islam and the responsibility of the world's muslims in the terrorist <unk> <unk> much of the world today
murdoch is wrong
muslims all muslims are not responsible for what happened
but that's not the end of it
<unk> <unk> and the tens of thousands who favorite their tweets are right in saying this is not the fault of all muslims nor is it exclusively up to them all of them to take on the battle
but the tweets leave out a fundamental part of the problem
muslims have a crucial role to play in fighting extremist acts committed in the name of their religion and indeed many of them are doing it
from social media to the highest <unk> of power there are muslims demanding reform demanding <unk> of individual freedoms and <unk> violence
<unk> parents need not drop everything they're doing and head for the fight against isis
but individuals in this era of high <unk> can argue for their beliefs
<unk> for one with a large following and gift for <unk> his views has the ability to advance the conversation away from both <unk>
there are people to <unk> on all sides not just that murdoch is wrong but also that the ideology of the terrorists is wrong
a <unk> poll of fourteen thousand two hundred and forty four people in fourteen countries with large muslim populations revealed a few months ago significant minorities of muslims believe suicide bombings are justified to defend islam from its enemies
in bangladesh forty seven percents said suicide bombings are acceptable in gaza sixty two percents agreed in egypt twenty four percents did
those are <unk> numbers a sign that <unk> extremism is indeed a problem one that muslims should view with urgency not least because the vast majority of suicide bombings of terrorism of all kinds kills muslims
thousands of muslims including europeans have joined the <unk> violent isis which by some accounts enjoys the support of a rather large minority of french and european muslims
that is excellent news for europe's extreme right wing politicians who have built their careers on racism and religious <unk> most recently against muslims and immigrants from muslim countries and have found a <unk> sweet spot in the carnage
after the killings at charlie hebdo and the subsequent siege and murder of jewish shoppers at a paris kosher market the stage is set for anti immigrant parties to make gains in europe
and the <unk> <unk> well beyond
hundreds of schoolgirls kidnapped in nigeria by the islamist terrorist group boko haram whose name <unk> the islamic term haram what is forbidden to boko a word used to described a western education
even as the media was focused on paris boko haram slaughtered thousands more in nigeria including many children <unk> out entire villages
these attacks should bring together a coalition spanning the political <unk> including muslims christians and jews conservatives and <unk> the overwhelming <unk> of whom favor the defense of personal freedoms
and muslims should stand in the <unk> of that coalition with their arms thrown across the <unk> of jews <unk> <unk> of the intolerance that has made itself at home among far too many of their <unk>
there is a war of ideas raging in the muslim world
the prize is the soul of modern islam
it's not enough to say this is not my fault
terrorists say they fight on behalf of muslims
muslims can not be mere <unk>
but there is a well meaning segment of the population particularly among the left that <unk> tries to deny the religious context of the terrorist attacks and the need for it to be addressed within muslim communities
by doing this the left and the center push people to the right that is people who agree with <unk> views
this is because many voters know the denial is <unk> or blind
those who close their eyes to the religiously inspired motivation of the killers and of their religion inspired goals are just as mistaken
are all muslims responsible
are they guilty
no of course not
do they have a responsibility to help fight this growing threat
yes absolutely yes
in some respects it is <unk> of the role of the german people in the aftermath of world war ii
today's germans are not guilty of what their parents and grandparents did
but they have a special role in preventing a <unk> of those <unk> and dangerous views
it's not <unk> to <unk> that most of the terrorism we see today is being <unk> by people who say they want sharia islamic law that they want a muslim caliphate that they reject <unk> in favor of life in the way of the prophet <unk> day
we have seen isis the self <unk> caliphate or islamic state kidnapping raping and <unk> women
beheading hostages europeans and americans but mostly muslims
islamist terrorists organizations committed to imposing their views of what their religion <unk> are killing without mercy in syria iraq egypt israel somalia pakistan india france belgium canada australia and elsewhere
only the perpetrators their supporters and their <unk> are guilty
don't let anyone use the tragedy to score political points or to <unk> muslims as a whole
but don't deny the truth
there is a dangerous problem within islam that must be addressed by muslims with the support of the rest of the world
both <unk> in this discussion have it wrong and by <unk> their <unk> they harm efforts to protect tolerance from the <unk>
to make the world safe for muslims and non muslims for everyone including those <unk> grenades backs and forth in social media
the court of <unk> ruled tuesday that mubarak and his two sons will stand trial again after accepting their appeal state media reported
mubarak his sons <unk> and <unk> and four new defendants are accused of <unk> seventeen point nine million dollar allocated for the <unk> of presidential <unk>
mubarak was sentenced last year to three years in prison
his sons to four years each
they have maintained their innocence
the <unk> appealed saying their sentences were too harsh
mubarak ruled egypt as president for twenty nine years before he was ousted during the arab spring protests
in another case he was convicted in two thousand and twelve of <unk> orders to kill peaceful protesters during the country's two thousand and eleven uprising and was sentenced to life in prison
he appealed and was granted a new trial last year
in november he was cleared of those charges and of corruption
consider the choice of targets of the terrorists
a magazine that in the terrorists minds had insulted the prophet mohammed
before they died on friday one of the kouachi brothers who carried out the attack on the charlie hebdo magazine spoke on the phone to a french journalist saying we are just telling you that we are the <unk> of prophet mohammed
consider that the other target of the terrorists was a kosher store serving jews
<unk> anti semitism is of course a <unk> of militant islamist ideology
militants can point to the <unk> verse o believers take not jews and christians as friends as religious proof for this position
consider also that the three terrorists believed in their own minds that they were holy warriors who would die <unk> in their holy war and that they would live on in paradise
one of the terrorists cherif kouachi planned to fight in the iraq war against the americans but was detained by french authorities in two thousand and five before could <unk> his plan
kouachi told french investigators that the wise leaders in islam told him and his friends that if they die as martyrs in jihad they would go to heaven and that martyrs would be greeted by more than sixty <unk> in a big palace in heaven
this refers to the <unk> or saying of the prophet mohammed that martyrs will enjoy the favor of seventy two <unk>
before he was killed another of the terrorists amedy coulibaly recorded a martyrdom video in which pledged his allegiance to the leader of isis
in the video he said i am <unk> addressing the caliph of the muslims abu bakr al baghdadi
i pledged allegiance to the caliph as soon as the caliphate was declared
this statement refers to the belief that a muslim caliphate or empire will stretch across the muslim world and will be led by a caliph who is the political and religious successor of the prophet mohammed
the fact that the paris attacks have something to do with islamic beliefs can not be wished away either by claims that islam is simply a religion of peace or by political <unk> or because we live in an increasingly <unk> modern era that often doesn't take deeply held religious beliefs sufficiently seriously
the reason that islamist militants can <unk> that jihad is necessary against the perceived enemies of islam is that there is <unk> ammunition in the quran to <unk> their beliefs
the same could also of course be said for the old testament which is full of scenes of violent death visited on the enemies of god
and it is also the case that only a tiny minority of muslims are willing to do violence in the name of allah
nonetheless a well known verse in the quran which for believers is literally the word of god <unk> muslims that they fight and <unk> the nonbelievers wherever you find them seize them <unk> them and lie in wait for them in every <unk> of war
the same verse adds that if the nonbelievers <unk> and pay what is <unk> in some <unk> of the quran as charity to the poor and in others as a tax to muslims then they can be spared
indeed when osama bin laden made a formal declaration of war against the jews and the <unk> in one thousand nine hundred and ninety eight he cited this <unk> verse at the beginning of his declaration
<unk> therefore that islamist terrorism has nothing to do with islam are as <unk> as claims that the <unk> had nothing to do with christian beliefs about the <unk> of jerusalem or that the <unk> growth of israeli settlements on palestinian <unk> are not <unk> in the beliefs of certain fundamentalist jewish groups about the god given rights of jews to live in their god given homeland
after paris attacks seven questions being asked about islam
indeed there is an explicitly religious civil war driven by terrorist groups such as isis al qaeda and hezbollah <unk> in the middle east in countries such as iraq syria and yemen that <unk> <unk> <unk> against <unk> <unk>
this war could well <unk> the religious thirty years war that <unk> apart seventeen th century europe in both <unk> and length
already hundreds of thousands have died in these conflicts
elements in the gulf arab states and iran have helped to <unk> this regional civil war
certain gulf arabs support <unk> jihadist sunni groups such as al qaeda's affiliate in syria while iran supports shia militant forces such as hezbollah
islam is to be sure a big tent and the one and a half billion muslims in the world run the <unk> from <unk> moderate pacific <unk> to <unk>
salafism is an <unk> branch of islam that is particularly <unk> in saudi arabia
salafism is <unk> of what its <unk> consider to be islamic <unk> such as shia islam as well as of other religions such as judaism or christianity and it offers <unk> roles for women outside the home
salafism is not however a <unk> to violence for the tens of millions of its peaceful <unk> around the world
that said while very few <unk> are terrorists jihadist terrorists are almost <unk> <unk>
a similar point could also be made about christian <unk> in the united states
very few kill abortion clinic doctors but anyone who kills an abortion clinic doctor in the states is almost <unk> a christian fundamentalist
for terrorists such as those who carried out the attacks in paris last week their salafism also became increasingly <unk>
to <unk> it down they adopted the ideology of what can be <unk> <unk> as it was osama bin laden who laid out this ideology for a global audience in a series of interviews and statements he made before he was killed in two thousand and eleven
before we get into an explanation of this ideology it might be helpful to explore what an ideology is
it is an idea or set of ideas that claims to fully explain the world and often history itself
examples of such <unk> might include <unk> <unk> which claimed that history could only be understood in material terms as a class struggle between the <unk> and the workers
another such ideology was <unk> which <unk> that the german <unk> <unk> <unk> dominant place in the world could only be <unk> by the enslavement or elimination of <unk> <unk> ethnic groups particularly jews
<unk> by their nature are not <unk> to challenges posed by <unk> evidence
whether they are secular or they are religious they are <unk> <unk> in the sense they are belief systems that are not open to question or scientific inquiry
you either believe
or you don't
common to many <unk> is the belief that history has a direction and a purpose and that at the end of this history the world will be transformed into a <unk>
in <unk> <unk> case this <unk> was the <unk> society of true communism and for <unk> it was the thousand year <unk>
in the minds of the true believers the only possible explanation for why these <unk> haven't been <unk> as yet is that a <unk> set of enemies are standing in the way
since such groups are blocking the creation of <unk> they are not simply just <unk> they are in fact evil and therefore must be <unk>
this belief explains both <unk> campaign to murder millions of russians who were purported to be <unk> as well as <unk> holocaust
similarly the ideology of <unk> is the belief that the world will finally be made perfect after the <unk> of a taliban style caliphate that will stretch across the muslim world from indonesia to morocco
its supporters brand as evil the people and nations that they <unk> are standing in the way of this dream including jews israel any middle eastern regime that doesn't follow taliban style rule the united states and its western allies such as france
in bin <unk> telling there was a global conspiracy by the west and its <unk> allies in the muslim world to destroy true islam and this conspiracy is led by the united states
religious based moral outrage about western foreign policy in the muslim world a key <unk> of the ideology of <unk> is a <unk> theme that crops up with many militant islamist militants
the paris terrorists shared in this
one of the terrorists amedy coulibaly recorded a video before he died saying that the bombing of isis positions in syria and iraq by western countries had motivated his attacks
if you attack the islamic state we will attack you
you and your coalition you <unk> regularly over there
for the paris terrorists as it was for bin laden the only answer to the purported western assaults on islam is revenge
that explains nine eleven and it also explains the terrorist attacks in paris last week
to claim that these attacks had nothing to do with a number of islamic beliefs <unk> <unk> is <unk>

the <unk> acted with a key <unk> in mind knowing that millions of people would tune in to watch
so the camera has created a new kind of crowd in the course of our long history of public beheadings

that morning the public <unk> of german <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> outside the saint pierre prison in <unk> was <unk> by a <unk> <unk> to the authorities
you can see the footage online today
photographers also recorded the action and their pictures filled newspapers and magazines in the days after <unk> death
as if the <unk> crowds on the day were not bad enough now the action could be viewed again and again by <unk> thousands of <unk>
after that the <unk> was <unk> away behind prison walls not because <unk> were too horrifying to watch but because people will watch them no matter how horrifying they are
for centuries public executions had been intended to <unk> by example when for many they were little more than light entertainment
the <unk> of film proved this beyond <unk> the history of beheadings tells us anything it is that there will always be people who want to see
today the internet offers us front row seats on the understanding that no one need know we have taken our places to watch
murders can be nothing to do with us even as we click on the screen to play the film

the <unk> statement did not give details of allegations against the suspects
i don't think we've been shown anything at this point said richard <unk> the lawyer representing the <unk>
it was not clear monday night if mohamed had <unk> an attorney
<unk> terrorism laws were <unk> in april two thousand and thirteen to include an offense for anyone leaving or attempting to leave canada for the purpose of committing a terrorist act abroad

the fuselage or main body of the plane is believed to have been found by a ship <unk> for wreckage northeast of where the tail section was previously discovered said supriyadi an operations coordinator at indonesia's national search and rescue agency who goes by only one name
but he said he hasn't seen the full report on the reported discovery yet and it hasn't been confirmed so far by the head of the search and rescue agency
the discovery of the fuselage would be a significant development as officials have suggested that many of the bodies of those on board the plane are likely to be found with it
forty eight bodies have so far been recovered from the sea some of them still strapped into seats
but more than one hundred remain missing
the overwhelming majority of the people on flight qz eight thousand five hundred and one were indonesian
there were also citizens of britain france malaysia singapore and south korea
on tuesday divers <unk> the cockpit voice recorder which is designed to <unk> all sounds on a plane's flight deck
the device is expected to help investigators understand what went wrong aboard flight qz eight thousand five hundred and one which went down in the java sea last month with one hundred and sixty two people aboard as it was headed toward singapore from the indonesian city of surabaya
on monday searchers recovered the plane's other key information source the flight data recorder which stores a vast amount of information about the aircraft's performance including air speed and cabin pressure
the flight data recorder tells investigators what happened on a plane but the cockpit voice recorder tells them why said mardjono <unk> a senior official at indonesia's national transportation safety committee which is leading the investigation into the disaster
the why is mostly in there he said of the voice recorder which captures conversations between pilots as well as other sounds in the cockpit
the two flight recorders have been taken to a lab in jakarta the indonesian capital for analysis
investigators say they have successfully <unk> the contents of both devices
but mardjono cautioned that <unk> the information requires much more time
after the <unk> investigators should have a pretty good idea within a couple of days of what happened aboard the plane mary schiavo a former inspector general of the u.s. department of transportation said this week
the flight data recorder usually contains hundreds of <unk> and thousands of data points she said that look a bit like an <unk> when they're printed
mardjono said he expected a preliminary report to be released within a month of the crash which happened december twenty eight
but it's unclear how much information the initial document will contain beyond what's already been made public
the final report <unk> investigators full conclusions will take months mardjono said
the agency's final report into adam air flight five hundred and seventy four which crashed in indonesian waters on new year's day two thousand and seven killing all one hundred and two people on board came out more than a year after that disaster
mardjono said the airasia plane's flight data recorder was in good condition after being pulled out of the water from under the debris of a wing monday
the recovery of the flight recorders took place after the plane's tail was lifted from the waves saturday
observers have suggested that the locations of the different parts of debris indicate the plane broke apart when it hit the water not when it was still at a high altitude
supriyadi the indonesian search official said monday that the debris patterns suggest the aircraft exploded on impact
but the country's transportation investigators said it was premature to say what had happened and one expert questioned the search <unk> choice of words
the word exploded i think maybe loses a little bit in translation said david soucie a former federal aviation administration safety inspector
i think really what he's meaning is a <unk> from the impact itself
as with any <unk> object hitting something very hard the pressure <unk> between the outside and the inside is very significant and it'll actually tear apart the aircraft on the top soucie said
that may be what he's referring to

though his fellow <unk> of industry <unk> in protest <unk> had based the decision on his own in house research of how far he could push <unk> <unk> before they became so <unk> or <unk> that they'd begin making <unk> mistakes
within a few years the <unk> way became the industry standard and thus was born the forty hour work week
<unk> too began making <unk> predictions of a coming age of <unk> leisure
<unk> thought that by two thousand and thirty <unk> be working a fifteen hour work week and all would have time to enjoy the hour and the day <unk> and well
others predicted a twenty two hour work week six month work year or a standard retirement age of thirty eight
if anything <unk> at the time worried about what the masses would do to occupy themselves with so much free time on their hands
the predictions seem <unk> now
in the united states white <unk> workers work longer and more extreme hours than their <unk> in just about any other advanced economy save south korea where the wall street journal has reported <unk> koreans are checking themselves into prison like <unk> <unk> just to get away from it all and japan where they've even <unk> a word for death from <unk>
<unk>
workers in the united states give up among the most vacation days
we are the only advanced economy with no national vacation policy
and technology has <unk> not just flexible work but for work to <unk> into every corner every hour and every minute of the day
the forty hour work week of <unk> legacy can seem like a cruel dream the labor policy that later <unk> it the one thousand nine hundred and thirty eight fair labor standards act now <unk> gives businesses <unk> to work <unk> workers to the point of <unk> and to keep <unk> workers hours <unk> low to avoid paying benefits or <unk>
<unk> workers have too little leisure time that they can choose and control what leisure scholars say is the essence of pure leisure
and <unk> workers too much
though without either choice or control those blank <unk> hours of <unk> and <unk> anxiety can hardly be called leisure
just as with income inequality our experience of work and leisure is increasingly <unk>
as millions of americans remained <unk> from the economy working far less than they'd like and for a minimum wage that in no major city in the country could cover the cost of a two <unk> apartment others wear long work hours like a <unk> of honor
<unk> have found that our <unk> reward employees by how long they sit at their <unk> in the office not for what they do
leisure is seen as <unk> at best and <unk> or a waste of time at worst
and that's not just <unk> it's dangerous
we need to build an economy that <unk> enough work at fair wages for everyone
and we need to <unk> our lost leisure
those two aspirations can work together
in a knowledge economy our strength comes from the power of our ideas
and we are <unk> for those ideas and inspiration to hit in quiet moments of leisure
<unk> john <unk> and mark <unk> have <unk> brain waves and found the a <unk> moment comes in a calm relaxed state when we are doing anything but work like when physicist richard <unk> <unk> watched students <unk> off <unk> <unk> in the <unk> and began making <unk> of the <unk> for the fun of it which led to his developing the <unk> <unk> to explain <unk> <unk> and ultimately resulted in his nobel prize
<unk> is finding that when we are <unk> in leisure our <unk> are most active the <unk> mode network lights up which like airport hubs connect parts of our brain that don't typically communicate
so a <unk> thought a random memory an image can combine in novel ways to produce novel ideas
<unk> <unk> studied elite musicians at the berlin academy of music and is credited with the now wildly popular notion that it takes ten thousand hours of deliberate practice to master anything
but the key that separated the truly great from the good and the <unk> was the way they spent those ten thousand hours
they practiced intensely first thing in the morning when they were <unk> for no more than sixty to ninety minutes at a time and they <unk> more
in other words like brain waves like heart <unk> they worked in short <unk> and recovered in leisure and became excellent at what they did
but perhaps the most <unk> case for leisure is this
despite our <unk> culture we have a lot of <unk> in chair <unk> sick <unk> burned out and <unk> workers
we work long hours but we do not necessarily work productive efficient or creative hours
some years international <unk> of gdp per hours worked have found workers in norway ireland denmark and even france with their thirty days of paid vacation every year their caf culture their generous paid family leave policies their short work hours <unk> by law and their new <unk> <unk> some <unk> from expecting workers to check work related texts and <unk> after hours beat us by a mile
as we think about the next american economy we need to consider policies as well as cultural shifts that respect that people need time especially relaxed and personal time every bit as much as they need money
by <unk> down on <unk> by once again <unk> wages which have been <unk> to <unk> which has been rising we might not only be able to create more work for those who need it and work <unk> but foster the creativity and innovation that will lead to a more dynamic productive economy and a better life
after all isn't the pursuit of happiness part of what <unk> us as americans
award winning photographer peter <unk> was at the unity rally in paris which has been called the largest mass gathering in france's history
editor's note
<unk> david <unk> is a vice president and <unk> scholar at the <unk> <unk> international center for scholars and was a middle east negotiator in democratic and republican <unk>
follow him on twitter
the views expressed are his own
secretary of state john kerry will visit paris later this week but that the administration could have been so tone <unk> in missing a this <unk> chance to highlight its concerns over an issue critical to europe and america's own security is a stunning <unk>
it suggests an <unk> to see the paris attacks in their proper perspective although doing so is <unk> no easy matter only days afterward
as washington and others process those events there are <unk> that should guide their thinking in the period ahead
they include
the jihadis aren't taking over the world
after nine eleven many had an <unk> sense that more successful attacks would follow
they didn't
in fact both in europe and the u.s. it's stunning how few successful attacks directed by foreign terrorist organizations there have been
last year there were seventeen thousand nine hundred and fifty eight global fatalities to terror according to the university of <unk> global terrorism database
among them there were sixteen americans
almost eighty two percents of the terrorist attacks happened in only five countries
pakistan iraq syria yemen and afghanistan
terrorism emerging from the arab and muslim world along with weapons of mass destruction may well be to the twenty one st century what the cold war was to last century
the international <unk> defining national security challenge
just look what else occurred over the past week or so
two thousand people were killed by boko haram's <unk>
there's no winning the battle against jihadi terror or ultimately <unk> it
a perfect storm of jihadi <unk> driven by hatred and <unk> and growing shia sunni divisions have combined with a <unk> arab world that offers up either no governance or bad governance
and this will continue to produce <unk> radicalization and violence
the war on jihadi terrorism really is a war
but of a <unk> character
it will be with us for years to come
we can contain <unk> and try to prevent it
but we can not <unk> <unk> our borders or <unk> our <unk> without <unk> and <unk> our freedoms and way of life
the outpouring of goodwill and solidarity that has followed the paris attacks is an encouraging sign
and if it leads to greater international resolve more effective security cooperation smart counter terrorism and an effort in france and in europe to reduce discrimination against muslims and promote greater <unk> of jews it will help contain the jihadi threat
but you don't change a nation in a single traumatic act
nine eleven didn't do it
<unk> didn't
ferguson didn't
and the paris attacks won't either
anti muslim and anti immigration sentiment along with the rise of the far right has been developing for years
a new tolerance won't come easy
<unk> the same democratic values and freedom of expression and movement that the west <unk> will be used by jihadis and the <unk> muslim communities on which they feed to sustain their radical effort
don't let muslims and arabs off the <unk>
arab governments the arab league the head of al <unk> university in cairo and various muslim <unk> have issued statements <unk> the paris attacks and various arab and muslim leaders attended <unk> national rally in paris
all of this is important
but let's be clear
for far too long a disturbing minority of arabs and muslims have <unk> a religion in the service of a radical jihad
and as they did this too many other muslims have been <unk> silent and <unk> failing to condemn them and thus allowing them <unk> to operate
arab governments have sometimes <unk> jihadi ideology but other times as in the case of saudi arabia itself a victim of terror tried to accommodate it
or both
meanwhile anti semitic cartoons and <unk> <unk> <unk> in the arab and muslim press
there is an ongoing struggle within islam between sunni and shia <unk> and radicals <unk> and <unk> that is far from being resolved
islam's <unk> is nowhere near at hand
and until there is a <unk> <unk> between religion and the state better governance respect for freedom of expression and freedom of conscience and genuine tolerance and regard for minority rights <unk> will flourish
no u.s. narrative or <unk> generated reform effort can <unk> the jihadis
only the muslims themselves can do that
the <unk> of arab and muslim governments are to blame for jihadi terror
but there's no doubt that western policies and practices have made an already bad situation worse
it is the <unk> of <unk> that the u.s. the victim of mass terror on nine eleven helped enable the jihadis further with its ill considered and <unk> invasion of iraq
one result was the creation of al qaeda in iraq
anger toward the west runs deep in this broken and <unk> region
u.s. relationships with allies such as saudi arabia and israel feed the jihadi narrative as do effective counterterrorism methods such as drone strikes that that kill <unk> and often and <unk> the mainstream muslims as well
whatever else we try to achieve in this broken angry and <unk> region our <unk> goal must be to prevent attacks on the u.s. and help our allies do the same
what happened in paris is a tragic reminder of how challenging this will be

the <unk> has enjoyed a remarkable la liga season so far <unk> twenty six times in seventeen matches for table <unk> real madrid this term

if nothing else the trip to zurich was a welcome <unk> from speculation about his future at barcelona
rumors have circulated recently that the argentine is <unk> at the <unk> camp messi was recently left out of the starting line up in a la liga match against real <unk> and missed a training session the following day with a stomach <unk>
reports have suggested that he is <unk> with manager luis <unk> <unk> methods and is seeking <unk> in the english premier league
but he was quick to <unk> any idea of a move
speaking to barcelona tv after the <unk> <unk> three one win against <unk> madrid messi said suggestions that he wanted to leave the spanish <unk> were lies
i haven't asked for anything to stay here because i have never wanted to go anywhere else

editor's note
<unk> peter <unk> is director of the atlantic <unk> africa center
the views expressed are his own
the blasts which killed three people besides the bombers and injured forty six more came just a day after another bomb strapped to a girl described by witnesses as about ten years old exploded in a busy market in the city of maiduguri killing at least twenty people
while coming in widely <unk> <unk> thousands of miles apart the attacks in france and nigeria were both motivated by an islamist extremist ideology that <unk> a modern world shaped by political economic and social <unk> and in the case of boko haram whose name can be roughly translated as education is forbidden also <unk> scientific progress
to achieve this end no <unk> is too brutal or <unk> too low as is <unk> both by the recent actions of boko haram and the <unk> posted video by the gunman who killed four hostages in a kosher grocery store near paris
the difference has been that while there has been an outpouring of solidarity for the french victims and <unk> of international solidarity for france's stand against violent extremism nothing similar has been <unk> for nigeria's fight against the growing power of boko haram at least not since the <unk> and largely <unk> global social media phenomenon of the <unk> campaign last year
this is despite the fact that over the course of recent months boko haram has proven itself to be as much of a threat to international peace and security as the so called islamic state of iraq and syria which has received so much attention
in fact as <unk> foundation terrorism analyst <unk> <unk> has pointed out boko haram's videos show a troubling <unk> between the nigerian militants and their isis counterparts not only in terms of <unk> and ideology but also insurgency <unk>
boko haram leader <unk> <unk> for example first expressed support for the isis caliph abu bakr al baghdadi this past summer
meanwhile boko haram has added the jihadist black banner to its <unk> and the isis anthem to the musical <unk> on its videos
in one recent video <unk> even seemed to declare that he is establishing his own islamic caliphate and greeted his brothers in afghanistan pakistan somalia and yemen as well as the caliphate in iraq and syria
even more <unk> than boko haram's extremist ideology and gruesome terrorist acts should be the increasing military sophistication demonstrated by the nigerian militants
<unk> while it is largely ignored by american and european leaders and only <unk> covered by major media outlets boko haram has been steadily gaining ground in its war against nigeria
as i wrote several months ago boko haram has like isis clearly moved beyond one off <unk> attacks to sophisticated military operations resulting in the <unk> of increasingly large <unk> of territory successfully <unk> and now effectively controlling large <unk> of three states in northeastern nigeria by some estimates a total area larger than the netherlands belgium and <unk> combined
boko haram's <unk> base has been used by the group as a staging ground for what has become a steady campaign of terrorist attacks like the past <unk> suicide bombings which regularly hit more than half a dozen other nigerian states as well as neighboring countries like niger many of which are already under significant pressure from militants linked to al qaeda's north african affiliate
<unk> president <unk> <unk> has even gone so far as to declare to the <unk> <unk> <unk> that the islamic state is at our door
by some estimates more than ten thousand people in nigeria alone have died as a result of boko haram related violence in two thousand and fourteen while more than one point five million others have been displaced
just last week the militants stormed baga on the shores of lake chad one of the last towns in the region remaining in government hands reportedly killing more than two thousand civilians
moreover the militants are showing increasingly advanced conventional military capabilities in contrast with the <unk> nigerian military forces they square off against
in early september for example the group shot down a nigerian attack jet that was operating against it and captured the pilot whom it later apparently beheaded according to a video obtained by the associated press
what makes the threat from boko haram all the more significant is the political and economic context of nigeria africa's most populous country and the largest economy on the continent
the west african country is in the midst of a <unk> <unk> general election including a <unk> presidential race between <unk> president <unk> jonathan and former military ruler <unk> <unk> with votes to be cast just a month from now
no doubt boko haram which <unk> democratic politics along with other <unk> ideas will take advantage of the campaign and <unk> process to step up attacks
it is hard to imagine how the threat could not have an impact on the vote
in paris on sunday police and military forces <unk> out across the french capital meaning there was a reasonable sense of safety for <unk>
in nigeria even if the country deployed every last soldier and <unk> it would barely be able to put one security officer at each of its <unk> stations
and as if this were not bad enough <unk> oil prices have <unk> nigerian government revenues <unk> <unk> the resources available to defeat the extremists in battle and win the subsequent peace with social and economic development of an area whose long running <unk> helped give rise to the insurgency in the first place
it does of course go without saying that both the nigerian political class and its military with all their attendant <unk> bear responsibility for the dire situation the country finds itself in
but that fact alone should not <unk> the international community of its obligation in helping to tackle the growing threat posed by boko haram any more than legitimate concerns about generally <unk> leadership by french president franois hollande and the french political <unk> failure to deal <unk> with the potential for radicalization among <unk> of the country's marginalized muslim population prevented world leaders from showing their support for france in recent days
as the roman catholic <unk> of jos nigeria pleaded on the bbc recently we need that spirit to be spread <unk> just when it happens in europe but when it happens in nigeria in cameroon
in the struggle against islamist extremism and for peaceful <unk> and progress it is time the international community recognized there is no place for a <unk> of two cities
on december twenty nine <unk> cafferkey thirty nine of glasgow scotland became the first person to be diagnosed with the virus on uk soil shortly after returning from sierra leone
on january three london's royal free hospital said <unk> condition had <unk> to critical
but in a statement monday the hospital updated her condition
the royal free hospital is pleased to <unk> that <unk> cafferkey is showing signs of improvement and is no longer critically ill it said
she remains in isolation as she receives specialist care for the ebola virus
on december thirty one the hospital said cafferkey had decided to have a blood <unk> treatment using <unk> from ebola survivors and to take an <unk> <unk> drug
the royal free is equipped with a high level isolation unit where access is restricted to specially trained medical staff
a specially designed tent with controlled <unk> covers the patient's bed
cafferkey had been working at save the children's kerry town ebola treatment center in sierra leone for six weeks before she returned to glasgow via <unk> and london heathrow airports
last week save the children said it was doing everything possible to establish how cafferkey contracted ebola and had been conducting a review since she was confirmed as having the virus
all are sites that suffered attacks committed by muslim extremists in recent months
expand the time frame and the list <unk>
even as the vast majority of muslims condemn terrorism the <unk> and <unk> of the assaults have led many people to ask tough questions about the faith
here are some that seem to be on a lot of minds
many muslims <unk> at mere <unk> of this idea noting that there are one point six billion muslims in the world most of whom live peaceful and productive lives
here's how muslim human rights lawyer <unk> <unk> responded on cnn after the attack that killed twelve in paris on wednesday
cnn is not the only news outlet raising this question by the way
the new york times explored the link between islam and violence in a front page article on thursday
<unk> and other muslims note that almost every faith from christianity to judaism to <unk> to buddhism has produced acts of terrorism
think about it this way
if you were a jew during the <unk> in spain would you think that christianity is <unk> violent
scholars say there is rarely a direct link between religious beliefs and violent behavior
instead terrorism is generally caused by a complex web of factors
but there's no escaping this fact
the number of attacks committed by self proclaimed muslims has risen sharply in recent years
those attacks have led some critics to argue that islam is <unk> violent
to make their case they point to the sword verse in the quran as exhibit a
here's what the verse says
then when the sacred months are drawn away <unk> the <unk> wherever you find them and take them and <unk> them and lie in wait for them at every place of ambush
but if they <unk> and perform the prayer and pay the <unk> then let them go their way
raymond ibrahim an author and frequent critic of islam argues that based largely on that verse islam's learned officials <unk> <unk> and <unk> throughout the ages have all reached consensus <unk> on the entire muslim community that islam is to be at <unk> war with the non muslim world until the former <unk> the latter
many muslims <unk> at that argument noting that the vast majority of muslims are clearly not <unk> with other religions
but this verse has been <unk> by extremist groups like isis who say that muslims have a sacred duty to kill the <unk>
mainstream muslim leader accuse both islam's critics and extremists of <unk> the sword verse from its historical context
this verse can not be taken as a <unk> <unk> execution order on all non muslims <unk> qadhi a conservative muslim american cleric explained in a <unk> in <unk> last month
the <unk> passage <unk> only to <unk> in islam's arabian <unk> he said
there's no sugar <unk> it it's a threat said qadhi who has a large following in the united states
it was meant to <unk> people and that's why <unk> disappeared from the arabian peninsula
two
why have there been so many recent attacks by extremist muslims
there's no single answer
instead experts say there are a range of reasons from personal motives to global movements from ancient <unk> to modern technology
take for example the two suspects in the paris terrorist attack that killed twelve this week cherif kouachi thirty two and his brother said thirty four
both were killed by french police after an intense manhunt on friday
according to french media the men massacred journalists at charlie hebdo a satirical magazine to avenge the prophet mohammed a <unk> figure in islam
but the brothers born in france to algerian parents and <unk> at a young age weren't particularly religious growing up
cherif kouachi was more interested in smoking <unk> listening to <unk> hop and <unk> girls according to french media
a brookings institution report <unk> a <unk> picture of life for first generation french immigrants particularly from north africa
many live in neighborhoods suffering from extreme poverty welfare <unk> black markets and broken families
nearly one in five don't have hot water at home the report found
muslims meanwhile often <unk> about being <unk> by france's largely secular culture
we don't yet know much about the kouachi brothers childhood but we do know that cherif kouachi eventually met a <unk> fellow french algerian farid benyettou who introduced him to a new culture and a new cause
the wise leaders in islam told and his friends that if they die as martyrs in jihad they would go to heaven kouachi said in french court documents
meanwhile kouachi watched images of the iraq war on television and became convinced that he should take up arms to defend fellow muslims against american troops
in two thousand and five he was arrested as he was about to travel to iraq
three years later kouachi was sentenced to three years in prison for being part of a jihadist recruitment ring in paris
less is known about said kouachi but french and u.s. authorities say evidence indicates that both brothers received military training from al qaeda in yemen a failed state that has become a <unk> ground for terrorists
<unk> or impoverished youths
<unk> radicals who exploit islamic teachings to recruit followers and lone wolf attackers over the internet
<unk> of revenge for perceived <unk>
easy access to <unk> weapons
states too weak to kick out terrorists or <unk> the jihadist <unk> to places such as syria and yemen
none of these factors alone <unk> terrorists
they all do
three
how do many muslims feel right now
this email from a longtime muslim american source <unk> up the sentiment
muslims can not get a break
every day there must be an event to suggest islam is <unk> violent
such acts destroy years of goodwill and work about islam
<unk> these feelings of frustration many muslims say is the <unk> that all muslims shoulder the blame for <unk> attacks or aren't doing enough to denounce them
daniel <unk> of the website muslim matters wrote one of the <unk> <unk> to this idea on friday <unk> suggesting that what muslims really need is an <unk> app
with the <unk> muslims can say not in my name at the speed of life
and non muslims no longer need to wonder whether one point six billion muslims around the world feel the <unk> and <unk> apologize for that latest <unk> crime some idiot carried out while shouting allahu akbar
on a more serious note recent <unk> show that large <unk> of muslims around the world are increasingly concerned about islamic extremism
four
does islam really ban all images of the prophet mohammed
there's nothing in the quran islam's primary text about depicting the prophet
but according to the <unk> stories and <unk> attributed to mohammed and his companions he did <unk> muslims from making images of him
in some ways the <unk> <unk> was a reaction against the other religions circulating through islam's arabian <unk>
mohammed had seen some of those faiths make <unk> and gods of their prophets and <unk> and wanted to ensure muslims attention would focus on god alone
many modern muslims follow that advice and several told cnn this week that they consider any images of mohammed to be <unk>
still there is a rich historical tradition particularly in places such as <unk> and turkey of depicting the prophet says christiane <unk> an expert in islamic art at the university of <unk>
five
why is mohammed so important to muslims
all religions <unk> their founding prophets but for many muslims mohammed is not just the <unk>
he's an <unk> of the perfect <unk> and a symbol of the faith
i being a muslim may tolerate any offense that targets my character and personality muhammad <unk> <unk> a saudi arabian teen told cnn on friday
however when the targeted personality is mohammad i shall never forgive that person
<unk> <unk> an expert in islamic law said that most law books <unk> criticism of mohammed in his role as a prophet with <unk> god
other laws say that <unk> the prophet can sometimes be considered <unk>
but islamic tradition also <unk> that mohammed was just a man as <unk> as the next guy
one <unk> tells the story of a man who asked mohammed for farming advice
the advice failed and the man returned to mohammed seeking an explanation
what do you want from me
the prophet answered
i'm only human
just a day before the paris terrorist attack egyptian president <unk> <unk> el <unk> urged muslim leaders to start a religious revolution
you <unk> are responsible before allah he told <unk> at al <unk> egypt's leading muslim institution
the entire world is waiting for your word
because the islamic world is being torn it is being destroyed it is being lost
and it is being lost by our own hands
because of his brutal human rights record <unk> up dissidents <unk> journalists and cracking down on the muslim brotherhood many muslims simply <unk> off al <unk> speech
but the idea of an islamic <unk> has been building for more than a decade with some saying that it's already ongoing and others arguing that no two religions follow the same historical path
many muslim <unk> and <unk> agree however that the religion needs to do some serious soul searching
we have lost so many of the core <unk> of islam
mercy compassion knowledge patience good <unk> <unk>
and the list goes on and on qadhi the cleric from <unk> said in a message posted on facebook on wednesday night
indeed it is truly sad our state of affairs
<unk> <unk> a senior adviser at the tony <unk> faith foundation <unk> the situation more <unk> saying
the house of islam is on fire
seven
how can the extremists be stopped
<unk> <unk> a former special representative to muslim communities for the u.s. state department called extremism a <unk> problem
the jihadists aren't recruiting forty year <unk> she noted on friday
they're targeting young people who are besieged by conflicting media images and can move quickly from internet <unk> to real world actions
nearly sixty percents of muslims are under thirty <unk> said so it's crucial for young muslims parents <unk> scholars artists and activists to muster virtual armies who can counter the extremist onslaught
how are isis and al qaeda building their armies
they're building their armies with recruits <unk> said
we have to stop the recruitment
the chocolate eggs filled with a <unk> <unk> of yellow and white <unk> were originally made in the united kingdom with <unk> signature <unk> milk chocolate

it is the twelve th march in dresden called by the protest group patriotic europeans against the islamization of the west or pegida since october
dresden police say the number of people attending these rallies has increased from an estimated three hundred and fifty protesters on october twenty to eighteen thousand on january five and twenty five thousand people on monday
the pegida movement emerged last year in the eastern german city
about two percents of <unk> <unk> are foreigners
on its facebook page pegida says citizens should wake from their <unk> and recognize the danger in the islamic ideology
stop the radical <unk> islamization it <unk>
as a society we should give people the chance to <unk> but we should not allow ourselves to be <unk> <unk> losing our freedom and democracy
the group claims to have supporters in more than thirty german cities and eighteen countries in europe
a pegida group in norway has also called for demonstrators to gather outside the town hall in the capital oslo to show support for the french and demonstrate opposition to what it calls the <unk> of norway
in dresden organizers earlier announced that monday's rally would <unk> the victims of last week's attacks in paris
critics however say that protesters are taking advantage of the attacks to attract supporters and <unk> hatred against refugees and foreigners
german justice minister <unk> <unk> called upon the organizers to cancel the protests
in an interview with german newspaper <unk> he said the victims do not deserve to be abused by such <unk>
the head of germany's <unk> party <unk> <unk> told <unk> television
i want to request those responsible
that they cancel their demonstrations for the foreseeable future especially at a time when the whole world is shocked about the events in paris
german chancellor angela merkel who has repeatedly voiced her <unk> with the pegida movement in recent weeks made similar demands
a representative for pegida in dresden told cnn that the march would not be canceled
they are putting us on the same level as radical extremists said <unk> <unk> one of <unk> leaders
we have the right to express our condolences to the victims of friday's terror attack
<unk> added
we all think we are being neglected by our politicians
she later told cnn that she does not want to be perceived as <unk>
muslims are only a tiny fraction of the population but they're so dominant in pushing for their demands that german culture is being pushed back said <unk>
we want to live <unk> with all immigrants here in germany but we as germans demand that they <unk> themselves into our culture and that they live in <unk> with our laws and don't build up parallel societies
at a planned protest in nearby <unk> organized by a group similar to pegida protest organizers had agreed to a city ban on showing anti mohammed cartoons but city authorities <unk> their ban monday following criticism that it limited free speech
according to german wire service <unk> presse <unk> <unk> city officials originally made the decision to ensure that the protests would remain peaceful
after paris one must <unk> that mohammed cartoons are meant to be a provocation <unk> quoted a city representative before the ban was <unk>
french cartoonists <unk> to the german pegida <unk> by publishing caricatures in which they <unk> the protesters
on saturday thirty five thousand people <unk> in front of <unk> landmark site the <unk> to advocate for tolerance
local politicians emphasized that they were open for a dialogue with pegida protesters
<unk> against anti islam demonstrators were planned in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> dresden <unk> and berlin
on its facebook page the <unk> group dresden <unk> called upon its supporters to protest against the anti muslim demonstrators
the dresden <unk> organizers wrote
it is your decision to decide whether there will only be protests in hearing range and sight distance or whether we will try to do more
large numbers of police officers will try to keep anti muslim protesters and their opponents from <unk> with a heavier presence because of the paris attacks
we have slightly increased the number of police officers involved a police representative told cnn on monday refusing to give specific numbers ahead of the demonstration
later police said that around one thousand six hundred officers were involved on monday
some eight thousand seven hundred people <unk> against pegida in dresden according to police
a poll by german newspaper der <unk> in december found that thirty four percents of <unk> believed their country was becoming increasingly <unk>
german interior minister thomas de <unk> told cnn's christiane amanpour last week that he was worried by this <unk> but that the significance of the protests should not be <unk>
it's new it's <unk> but we should not be dominated by pegida when we discuss our political agenda he said
on the other hand he said protesters posed some questions that needed to be answered
they ask
is there an end of asylum <unk> how dangerous is islam for our society what about the fight against is can this be successful
these critical questions have to be faced have to be answered de <unk> said
but he said he did not fear a rise of ugly <unk> in germany again
i'm confident we are strong he said
we learned our lessons from the nazi years and you can see it's very interesting that the organizations of pegida
they know exactly where the red line is which they should not cross this makes me more skeptical but they know where the <unk> are in germany so i don't see a <unk> of the <unk> it's less than in other european countries
and we are very well aware of it and we will fight against every <unk>
<unk> forbrig a european analyst with the german <unk> fund of the united states told cnn that the pegida movement had really only gained <unk> in the dresden area where its ideas had fallen on particularly <unk> soil
these protests are not so much fueled by fear of islam and fear of islamist attacks but by frustration at the cost of reunification about the way they are being integrated and represented since the fall of the berlin wall forbrig said
dresden already had a well established network of right wing extremists before <unk> emergence he said
it's more a case of east germans not entirely feeling at home in germany forbrig said
there is a feeling of second class citizenship and in order to be heard many east germans take to radical measures
the movement was basically a plea for more attention more than anything else he said
i think this movement has <unk> i don't think that there is much more of a local and regional potential that this movement can exploit
forbrig stressed that there was a substantial <unk> movement with those protesters <unk> pegida supporters last week in <unk> by ten to one
in fact across germany on monday more than eighty thousand people <unk> against pegida according to the news agency <unk>
in her new year's speech merkel addressed the issue of <unk> saying such demonstrations encourage the <unk> of people because of their skin color or religion
merkel urged people not to attend such rallies where people have hatred in their hearts she said
we know the value of unity in our country she said
it is the foundation of our success
last month a china bound thai airasia flight was forced to return to bangkok after a female chinese passenger threw hot water on a flight attendant amid a heated argument between her boyfriend and the cabin crew over service

china eastern airlines flight <unk> two thousand and thirty six bound for beijing was already seven hours behind schedule at three forty five a.m. when crew began to de ice the plane at the <unk> airport which saw more than one hundred flights delayed or canceled that night because of <unk> weather
frustrated by the lengthy delay some of the one hundred and fifty three passengers who had been sitting on the plane for two hours exploded with rage when the air <unk> stopped and an elderly passenger complained about <unk> due to the <unk> cabin airport police told state media saturday night

photos circulating on social media show two opened <unk> on the right side of the cabin with passengers still seated as well as crews and police on board documenting evidence
after <unk> and questioning all twenty five members of the tour group the authorities announced that a male member of the group prompted by a female tour guide opened two <unk> on the right side
both were sent to jail for fifteen days while police continued to look for the person who opened the exit on the left side
as news of the incident spread some chinese internet users <unk> with the perpetrators because of the delay but many considered their punishment too <unk> and suggested airlines should <unk> them for life
air rage is a common sight in delay prone china and saturday's episode was not the first dramatic incident involving <unk> passengers at <unk> airport
one of the country's busiest hubs more than thirty two million <unk> passed through its terminal last year
in august two thousand and twelve thirty one passengers from a long delayed flight tried to stop other planes from leaving <unk> by forcing their way onto the <unk> and <unk> a <unk> for half an hour state run xinhua news agency reported

then in april a thai airways red eye from bangkok to beijing turned bloody when a <unk> involving three chinese men broke out
during an official visit to the <unk> in september president xi jinping personally asked chinese tourists to behave themselves while traveling abroad
last year the government released a lengthy list of <unk> and <unk> aimed at turning chinese travelers into civilized tourists
it's very likely french prime minister manuel valls said
we are doing everything we can to <unk> what appears to be a network
no doubt there was <unk> and networks and maybe finance also he told cnn's christiane amanpour
investigators are still trying to piece together who was behind the islamist terror attacks that killed seventeen people
clues have emerged <unk> the attackers to a man who was once al qaeda's top recruiter in europe and to training with al qaeda in the arabian peninsula in yemen
said and cherif kouachi blamed for wednesday's attack on charlie hebdo magazine are dead
so is amedy coulibaly who authorities say killed a police officer carried out an attack at a kosher market and might have shot a jogger
it's not clear how many people might have helped them plot last week's attacks
but valls said they couldn't have done it without help
i don't really believe in the idea of the lone wolf he said
a key player who could help <unk> details is hayat boumeddiene coulibaly's partner and alleged accomplice
early reports said she was by his side during the hostage siege at the kosher market
but now investigators believe she was far from paris when the attacks unfolded
boumeddiene arrived in turkey from madrid on january two five days before the first attack in paris turkey's <unk> news agency reports
boumeddiene stayed at an istanbul hotel and then traveled to syria on thursday <unk> said
the last place authorities spotted boumeddiene was somewhere near turkey's border with syria
police have searched an apartment outside paris as they try to track her down
there investigators discovered isis flags automatic weapons and <unk> at an apartment rented out by coulibaly <unk> partner and suspected co <unk> france's rtl radio reported citing authorities
authorities are looking into whether boumeddiene helped prepare the attacks before leaving france valls told cnn
and there's another concern a u.s. intelligence official told cnn
now that she is believed to have escaped to syria boumeddiene could be used in propaganda videos to <unk> about the attacks
france was on its highest alert level monday as people went back to work and children returned to schools following the attacks
at least ten thousand soldiers and eight thousand police officers will be deployed across the country french media reported
we must remain vigilant because the threat is still very much present valls told cnn affiliate bfmtv

some three point seven million people marched in anti terrorism rallies sunday across france including one point five million in paris
about forty world leaders joined in the march in the french capital
police said no incidents had been reported despite the record number of people involved in the paris rally
still french law enforcement officers have been told to erase their social media presence and carry weapons at all times because terror sleeper cells have been activated in the country a police source said
investigators are looking into whether the attackers last week were part of a larger cell and if so when it may strike again valls told cnn's christiane amanpour
the threats go well beyond france
the new york city police department and other u.s. law enforcement agencies responded to a threat from isis after someone released again a september message that tells followers to rise up and kill intelligence officers police officers soldiers and civilians specifically naming the united states france australia and canada as targets
according to a new york police <unk> obtained by cnn department employees were told to remain alert and consider tactics at all times while on patrol especially in light of the attacks in france last week
the fbi and department of homeland security issued a similar bulletin to law enforcement across the united states
in a statement monday u.s. secretary of homeland security <unk> johnson said the transportation security administration is increasing the number of random searches of passengers and carry on <unk> at u.s. airports
johnson said his agency had implemented new measures including stepped up efforts to share information about terrorist threats and individuals of suspicion with france and other key counterterrorism allies and to boost security outside u.s. government buildings
early sunday a <unk> was <unk> at a german newspaper that <unk> charlie hebdo cartoons depicting the prophet mohammed though authorities haven't said whether the <unk> attack was connected to the charlie hebdo massacre
no one was injured in the attack
the police estimate <unk> from the local <unk> estimate which counted fifty one people with blast injuries
the blast happened at the main entrance of the ever crowded monday market the largest in the city of maiduguri
about twelve forty p.m. saturday the girl was stopped for <unk> by vigilantes who man the gates of the market according to witnesses and rescuers
the girl was among the dead said <unk> <unk> borno state's police spokesman
her precise age was not immediately clear
a source with inside knowledge of security operations described her as being about seventeen or eighteen
<unk> <unk> who was at the scene said she appeared to be about ten
the explosives detonated as the girl was being <unk> with a metal <unk> at the <unk> entrance he said
it's standard procedure for people to be <unk> before entering the market
although no one has claimed responsibility boko haram militants are the main suspects
this was the fourth attack on the city's market since july
the metal <unk> <unk> indicating she was carrying a metal under her dress but it exploded before she could be singled out from the crowd said <unk>
we believe that
an accomplice watching from a distance <unk> the remote he said
two of the vigilantes <unk> the entrance were among the dead <unk> said
the source reported that at least six vigilantes were killed
many of wounded victims taken to maiduguri specialist hospital have life threatening injuries said <unk> <unk> a nurse there
the marketplace in maiduguri has been a frequent target
more than forty five people were killed in late november in an attack and more than ten others died in another blast a week later on december one
another bombing on july one left at least fifteen people dead and several injured
on sunday three people were killed and forty three injured in a separate attack in <unk> police said

maiduguri is the capital of borno state
the deadly saturday blast came after a bloody massacre in baga a fishing town about one hundred and twenty five miles away where boko haram militants killed hundreds possibly as many as two thousand people
that massacre has been described as boko haram's deadliest act by amnesty international
the islamist group whose name translates to western education is <unk> has said its aim is to impose a stricter form of sharia law across nigeria which is split between a majority muslim north and a mostly christian south
the <unk> in the so called intelligence net reveal <unk> that led directly to the tragic events that have <unk> paris and the rest of france for days and also raise serious security concerns for the future here and abroad more than a half dozen experts on security and terrorism told cnn
and it couldn't come at a worse time
the <unk> murders of seventeen innocent people in three separate attacks in as many days has led to a <unk> city shaken shocked and in mourning
the new concerns raise the serious possibility that national security and surveillance of suspected terrorists in france will need to be increased or totally reviewed and <unk> to provide better safety for the nation as a whole some experts told cnn
and with one of the suspected terrorists still on the loose of as sunday night and new reports of sleeper cells being activated the security concerns are only <unk>
on saturday french police were told in a briefing that sleeper cells have been activated over the past twenty four hours inside france terror expert samuel laurent said he had been told by a police source
he said officers were told to erase all visible online presence on social media and keep their weapons on themselves at all times he said
there is a huge security failure those people were all considered as extremely dangerous said laurent a french expert who has written several books on terror groups their actions and <unk>
they were all supposed to be monitored
in the u.s. they were on a no fly list
so we can ask the question whether the u.s. is more able to monitor french jihadis on french territory than the french intelligence itself said laurent
one of the most common complaints heard by experts
simple <unk> showing aspiring terrorists in france having the upper hand
one former director of a french counterterrorism unit put it in these terms
there are far too many of them and far too few of us he said asking to speak <unk> because he did not have permission to speak to reporters
we can not possibly keep track of them all and we are seriously <unk> he said
two other former french terrorist officials agreed
jean charles <unk> head of the french center for analysis of terrorism put it like this
to put someone under surveillance you need two things
you need a good reason you need to believe someone is going to be radicalized that someone is going to become violent
the second thing you need is resources
you need twenty five agents
to survey them physically his phone his <unk> <unk> whatever
it is virtually impossible to put surveillance on three thousand to five thousand people in france who we know now are radicalized he said
beyond concerns about the state of simple surveillance experts point out other issues in the fight against terrorism
they're worried about the <unk> of jihadi videos on social media the growth of radical jihadi <unk> and the relative ease with which citizens of france can get into turkey and across the syrian border
the week of terror began at the offices of charlie hebdo where twelve journalists and others were murdered in close quarters leaving a gruesome and violent crime scene behind the likes of which paris has not seen in years
the attackers were two brothers who were well known to authorities and who would seemingly call out for increased surveillance and scrutiny
cherif and said kouachi were <unk> and had criminal records
the younger brother cherif was actually <unk> and jailed for his ties to a jihadist recruitment ring in the northeast <unk> of paris
the ring known by name for a park where they met the <unk> <unk> was recruiting young <unk> parisian muslims to join in the iraq war as jihadis against american forces
three of the young recruits wound up in <unk> where american forces died in numerous fierce battles
cherif kouachi was arrested in two thousand and five when he was about to leave for iraq
he was sentenced to three years in prison in two thousand and eight
but cherif didn't serve any time after the conviction the judge ruled that his <unk> detention had been enough
still his radicalization was well known to officials <unk> out in detailed court documents back in two thousand and seven
the documents obtained in conjunction with l'express show cherif had a long history of jihadist aspirations including going to iraq to combat the americans for the <unk> they had inflicted on iraqis
in two thousand and ten cherif was connected with a foiled plot to help a convicted terrorist escape from jail though there was not enough evidence to send him back to jail
during his stint behind bars cherif met djamel beghal a jihadi who was jailed for plotting to bomb the u.s. embassy in paris
beghal a known al qaeda recruiter was also connected to amedy coulibaly who died the same day as the two brothers after he killed several hostages at a kosher grocery store in eastern paris
at times before and after his stint in jail cherif kouachi was under surveillance by french authorities
but several former top french government officials told cnn he had dropped off priority lists this past summer and was less carefully monitored
<unk> older brother said traveled to yemen in two thousand and eleven according to a u.s. official for three or more months and is believed to have trained with al qaeda while he was there
coulibaly was also known by french authorities
he too had a criminal past with jihadi links
like cherif he was connected to the plot to free a convicted terrorist from jail
a western intelligence source told cnn that coulibaly was arrested in connection with the plot known as <unk> project in may of two thousand and ten
he was in possession of two hundred and forty rounds of <unk> for a <unk>
while he was awaiting trial for the foiled plot cherif visited coulibaly according to the western intelligence source
despite all these well known links to terror concerns and even the links between coulibaly and cherif all three attackers seem to have largely dropped from french surveillance priorities up to the moment they were linked to the ongoing attacks
we know that the level of alert has been <unk> in two thousand and fourteen said laurent
but he said the level of alert could and should have been raised
speaking just about the kouachi brothers and coulibaly laurent said
actually they could not be considered as a lower level threat
those people were extremely dangerous they were very motivated and the french have made a huge mistake by letting them off the radar or allowing them such a level of freedom in terms of operating finance and preparing this attack he said
<unk> head of the french center for the analysis of terror agreed
coulibaly had made several phone calls to target police in france
coulibaly is believed to have killed a french policewoman on thursday
he was killed during the hostage attack on the kosher market on friday
while not known previously it is now believed the kouachi brothers <unk> extended beyond iraq to yemen and al qaeda in the arabian peninsula
during their rampage the kouachi brothers had told witnesses they were avenging the prophet
on the day of their final shootout and deaths french station <unk> says it spoke with both cherif kouachi and coulibaly
the men both gave details of their jihadist yemeni ties
they said independently that they were <unk> and supported by anwar al <unk> the american born cleric who became the a key jihadi leader in yemen and was killed by americans several years ago
the ties to yemen and al qaeda prompted many of the experts speaking to cnn to raise even more security concerns for the future
said kouachi is suspected of <unk> off for terror training in yemen in july two thousand and eleven during a trip he made with another french national to oman in july two thousand and eleven according to multiple french officials who spoke to l'express national security reporter eric <unk>
<unk> shared the details of his reporting with cnn
u.s. intelligence agencies developed intelligence suggesting a high probability he <unk> across to yemen during the trip to oman and informed their french counterparts according to <unk> french sources
the french responded by placing said kouachi under surveillance in november two thousand and eleven by <unk> a <unk> de surveillance notice multiple french officials told <unk>
the surveillance was conducted by both <unk> france's domestic security service and later by the judicial police
<unk> were authorized for his cell phones and that of his brother cherif
but the surveillance of said was <unk> in june two thousand and fourteen because french security services <unk> him no longer dangerous <unk> was told
the surveillance of his brother cherif stopped earlier at the end of two thousand and thirteen
<unk> phone calls suggested he had <unk> with violent extremism and was focusing on <unk> clothing and shoes
the fact that al <unk> affiliate in yemen pulled off the most deadly terrorist attack in europe in a decade speaks for itself said cnn national security analyst peter bergen an expert on al qaeda and osama bin laden
groups like al qaeda in yemen as well as isis and other jihadist groups in the middle east are likely to continue to be a problem in europe for the foreseeable future
<unk> is of course always twenty twenty
in the case of a large scale terrorist attack there is often intelligence in the system that was <unk> before the event said bergen
the cia for instance knew that two men associated with al qaeda were living in the united states who later turned out to be among the <unk> of the flight that crashed into the pentagon on nine <unk> the lead bomber in the london bombings of two thousand and five was known to british law enforcement and the fort <unk> <unk> major <unk> <unk> had come to the attention of the fbi because of <unk> he exchanged before the attack with anwar al awlaki an al qaeda leader based in yemen
this time it's the french that dropped the ball but this is not a problem particular to france
i think it's fair to say that we should have sent someone with a higher profile to be there white house press secretary josh earnest said monday afternoon
he said obama himself would have liked to attend the march had the circumstances been a little different
but planning began friday night thirty six hours before the event began and there wasn't enough time for the <unk> and significant security work that needed to take place ahead of a presidential visit earnest said
he said obama's presence also would have meant extra restrictions on the people who were there
that said there is no doubt that the american people and this administration stand <unk> behind our allies in france as they face down this threat he said
and that was evident throughout last week
more than forty world leaders including the british german and israeli heads of state and russia's foreign minister joined at least one point five million people on the paris streets sunday for a unity march that became france's biggest ever public demonstration
but obama and his <unk> top hands were nowhere to be found an absence that triggered complaints that he missed a key leadership opportunity
the united states appeared to have options to send to the march
obama spent sunday at the white house with no public events on his schedule
vice president joe biden was at home in <unk> for the weekend also with a blank public schedule
<unk> attorney general eric holder was already in paris for security meetings and even recorded interviews with several u.s. sunday morning programs but he didn't attend the march
a secret service official said the agency was not asked to draw up security plans for a potential presidential trip to paris in advance of sunday's march
we weren't asked or <unk> about a trip the official said
but the agency had secret service agents on the ground in paris per its standard operating procedure
it would have been a challenging advance
based on what we know secret service spokesman brian <unk> said
but <unk> did not say that such an advance would have been impossible
during the white house briefing earnest suggested security challenges were a factor in not having the president travel to paris
but earnest acknowledged the secret service could have pulled it off
an agency official noted previous last minute presidential trips have happened during the obama presidency including a <unk> visit to south africa in december two thousand and thirteen for the memorial service for nelson mandela
the white house noted that it was represented in paris on sunday and has offered support to france in recent days
u.s
ambassador to france jane <unk> was in the march as was assistant secretary of state victoria <unk>
at a security summit holder was joined in those security meetings by deputy homeland security secretary <unk> <unk>
obama personally visited the french embassy in washington last week to offer his support
secretary of state john kerry meanwhile will visit paris on friday
kerry <unk> monday's march because he was in india on monday for a long planned event there with new prime minister narendra modi a key relationship as the united states tries to improve long <unk> trade ties with the country
kerry <unk> the criticism off as <unk> saying he'll visit paris on his way back to the united states to make <unk> clear how <unk> we feel about the attacks and response
the u.s. has been deeply engaged with the people of france since this incident occurred kerry told reporters adding that the united states has offered intelligence and law enforcement help
this is sort of <unk> a little bit in the sense that our assistant secretary of state victoria <unk> was there and marched our ambassador was there and marched many people from the embassy were there and marched
france's ambassador to the united states <unk> <unk> sought to show there are no hard feelings tweeting on monday
i am extremely grateful for the overwhelming support france has received from everybody here from the president to the ordinary american
the white <unk> push back comes as obama takes heat particularly from republicans considering two thousand and sixteen presidential <unk> for his absence
<unk> <unk> tweeted that obama should have stood with france in person to defend western values and show support for victims
sen. <unk> <unk> wrote for time
our president should have been there because we must never <unk> to stand with our allies
and sen. <unk> rubio said monday that it was a mistake not to send someone
rubio said on <unk> this morning that he <unk> that the president's security detail can be problem in mass <unk> like the rally but suggested holder or kerry should have gone in his place
i think in <unk> i would hope that they would do it differently rubio said
british prime minister david cameron german chancellor angela merkel israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu palestinian authority president mahmoud abbas and russian foreign minister sergey lavrov were among those who attended along with religious leaders
fareed zakaria host of cnn's global public square called the absence of top u.s. officials a mistake
france is the united states deepest ideological ally he said and it would have been a meaningful image to have a senior administration member or the president standing shoulder to shoulder with other leaders
zakaria noted that security concerns didn't <unk> netanyahu or abbas or other leaders from showing up
but obama's absence did show that the struggle against radical islam is not all about america zakaria said
many people have tended to think that islamic terrorism wouldn't exist without america zakaria said
this is really a struggle between the civilized world and a band of extremists
even if you take the u.s. out of it
the civilized world is up in arms
and jake tapper host of cnn's the lead said american leaders were <unk> <unk> from historic paris rally perhaps the most important public demonstrations in europe in the last generation
tapper not only called out the president and his administration but also prospective two thousand and sixteen <unk> from both parties for missing the opportunity to share in the global moment
obama spoke about the paris attacks on friday saying he wants the people of france to know the united states stands with you today stands with you tomorrow
the white house also announced sunday that it will host a february eighteen summit aimed at <unk> violent extremism
earnest said that event will highlight domestic and international efforts to prevent violent extremists and their supporters from <unk> recruiting or inspiring individuals or groups in the united states and abroad to commit acts of violence efforts made even more <unk> in light of recent tragic attacks in <unk> sydney and paris
he said the summit will include <unk> panel discussions and small group meetings focused on the local state and federal government levels
divers found the flight data recorder under the wreckage of one of the plane's wings said bambang soelistyo the head of indonesia's search and rescue agency
the search teams have also found but not yet recovered the other key source of information about the plane
the cockpit voice recorder said mardjono <unk> the chief investigator into the crash
the voice recorder is underneath debris he said expressing hope that it could be <unk> easily
the two devices known <unk> as black boxes are seen as crucial to <unk> the mystery of what brought down flight qz eight thousand five hundred and one as it flew toward singapore from the indonesian city of surabaya with one hundred and sixty two people on board
finding the data recorder is a huge step in the right direction for investigators said cnn aviation correspondent <unk> <unk>
it gives them so much information that they didn't have before
coupled with the debris that's already been collected the data recorder will enable investigators to begin to paint the picture of exactly what happened when things went <unk> wrong for this aircraft <unk> said
the data recorder is expected to provide a vast range of information about what the plane was doing including its air speed engine performance and the cabin pressure
the discovery of the device under the wreckage of a wing is significant according to mary schiavo a former inspector general of the u.s. department of transportation
that itself is a <unk> because i think that pretty much indicates that the plane broke apart when it hit the water she said adding that if the aircraft had broken up at a high altitude investigators wouldn't have found the wreckage that close together
one indonesian search official who goes by the single name of supriyadi said the debris pattern suggests the aircraft exploded on impact
but the country's transportation investigators said it was premature to <unk> about what had happened and one expert questioned the search <unk> choice of words
the word exploded i think maybe loses a little bit in translation said david soucie a former federal aviation administration safety inspector
i think really what he's meaning is a <unk> from the impact itself
as with any <unk> object hitting something very hard the pressure <unk> between the outside and the inside is very significant and it'll actually tear apart the aircraft on the top soucie told cnn
that may be what he's referring to
the cockpit voice recorder is expected to give insight into how the pilots responded to the crisis that brought down the plane
it captures all sounds on the flight deck notably conversations between the crew members
the flight data recorder is expected to be taken to a lab in jakarta the indonesian capital for analysis
once the information is <unk> investigators should have a pretty good idea within a couple of days of what happened aboard the plane schiavo said
the devices usually contain hundreds of <unk> and thousands of data points she said that look a bit like an <unk> when they're printed out
but schiavo added that she didn't think officials would release any information publicly for a couple of weeks
french aviation experts are helping the indonesian investigation which also expected to involve airbus the <unk> of the <unk> plane an a three hundred and twenty two hundred

surprising gesture
among those condemning the attack included the palestinian militant group hamas which the united states and others consider a terrorist organization

but obama's absence did show that the struggle against radical islam is not all about america he said

this is really a struggle between the civilized world and a band of extremists
even if you take the u.s. out of it

that's one challenge for authorities in the wake of last week's bloodshed in france
understanding what happened is one thing
understanding why it happened requires not just knowing the players involved but also their backgrounds and how they were linked
and according to authorities and sources the links extend between the suspects in the paris shootings and some of biggest names in the terror world
they have been tied to two of the world's biggest and strongest terrorist groups
al qaeda and isis
the names cherif kouachi said kouachi amedy coulibaly and hayat boumeddiene are now known around the world with three of them dead and the fourth boumeddiene being sought
here's what they did and their relationship to one other
who was he
like his brother said the thirty two year old french citizen of algerian descent was born in paris and raised in <unk> and foster homes from a young age
reports in french media described him as a <unk> fan more interested in <unk> girls than going to the mosque at least until he became a student of well known french spiritual leader farid benyettou
where did he go
french justice minister christiane <unk> told cnn that one of the kouachi brothers had been in yemen in two thousand and five but did not say which one
on friday shortly before his death as police stormed the building where he and his brother had holed up cherif kouachi told cnn affiliate bfmtv that he'd trained in yemen with al qaeda in the arabian peninsula
the united states believes cherif kouachi traveled to yemen in two thousand and eleven but investigators are still trying to confirm that the trip happened and <unk> details with other intelligence a u.s. official said
in two thousand and five he was arrested for being part of a jihadist recruitment ring in paris that sent fighters to join the conflict in iraq
the arrest came not long before he and another man were about to set off for syria en route to iraq where war was raging
evidence suggests cherif kouachi traveled to syria and returned to france in august two thousand and fourteen a french source close to that nation's security services told cnn
who did he know
in his conversation with bfmtv cherif kouachi said he met with anwar al awlaki the american born muslim who was the face of aqap until he was killed in the fall of two thousand and eleven in a u.s. drone strike
while in <unk> detention before his <unk> conviction of being part of a jihadist recruitment ring cherif met djamel beghal who was in prison for his role in an attempted attack against the u.s. embassy in paris in two thousand and one
beghal a french algerian was once known as al qaeda's premiere european recruiter
cherif kouachi and amedy coulibaly were also close associates according to court documents obtained by cnn which show that french authorities knew <unk> details about them as recently as a year ago
once they were freed from prison they would visit beghal bringing him food and money and sometimes spending days at his apartment
boumeddiene was also part of the visits
cherif kouachi and coulibaly <unk> their conversations by using code names over <unk> cell phones according to the court documents

where did he go
a senior yemeni national security official told cnn that said kouachi entered yemen multiple times with an officially issued visa during which time he was not being watched
kouachi first went to yemen in two thousand and nine said yemeni journalist and researcher mohammed al <unk>
officials haven't confirmed a connection between the two
he stayed there until mid two thousand and ten before leaving briefly and returning at the end of that year
he remained in yemen most of two thousand and eleven according to <unk> who said he met the man twice
u.s. officials have said said kouachi spent several months in yemen in two thousand and eleven receiving weapons training and working with al qaeda in the arabian peninsula
al <unk> said he saw kouachi again in two thousand and twelve in the old city of sanaa at another arabic language center
usa today reported that said kouachi traveled to syria
who did he know
while in yemen he lived in the same apartment as convicted underwear bomber umar farouk abdulmutallab journalist al <unk> said
this would have had to have been before december two thousand and nine when abdulmutallab was detained in detroit after his commercial airline bombing plot failed
kouachi said that he and abdulmutallab used to pray together at yemen's al <unk> school and that they shared an apartment for one to two weeks in yemen according to al <unk>

cnn does not have official confirmation that said kouachi knew abdulmutallab a nigerian national who authorities said at his u.s. trial told the fbi that he that he had links to yemen based al qaeda in the arabian peninsula
it's also possible that he met al awlaki while in yemen

we can certainly <unk> with the tragedy and the <unk> <unk> slaughter of a dozen inspiring lives but as an episode of political and cultural significance
its characteristics are decidedly <unk>
part of this is due to the fact that the united states and canada <unk> no muslim population <unk> to that of europe
the rising european impulse to push back against islam in this case through <unk> cartoons that <unk> insulted the faith its followers and prophet can appear <unk> <unk> even <unk>
north america also <unk> a satirical culture of the sort charlie hebdo <unk> in which <unk> <unk> are understood to be the appropriate language of <unk> commentary
cartoonists in north america increasingly do not see themselves as <unk> <unk> <unk> for whom no subject is beyond <unk> but rather as cautious advocates for a particular strain of <unk> tolerance
the cartoonists i know <unk> <unk> about committing <unk> of <unk> racism and various other <unk> of intolerance in their art and stories
they worry about drawing obama's <unk> too big and female <unk> <unk> too narrow not who they can get to hate them
the paris killing raises an <unk> question
to what extent <unk> of a free press should continue to needle an <unk> but <unk> minority
it's a question increasingly <unk> to an american culture ever more prone to aggressive self censorship in the name of preserving the <unk> <unk> of the easily <unk>
i do not think much of those on this side of the atlantic who are <unk> so <unk> in support of a right they've shown little interest in <unk> themselves

they moved to their current office a year ago paul moreira who works in the building told cnn's <unk> <unk>

on thursday businesses around the corner in the <unk> inner city neighborhood <unk> cafes filled with <unk> and traffic <unk> streets
aside from a <unk> of journalists satellite trucks the only sign of the carnage a day earlier was a tribute <unk> to a tree
a <unk> of <unk> and a quote by a french <unk>
it read there is only one step from <unk> to <unk>
aleppo has somehow <unk> between late two thousand and twelve when it was the open <unk> of the syrian civil war and today when the fight against isis has completely grabbed the world's attention span <unk> off the radar screen
but here is why it must not
there remain an estimated three hundred thousand civilians there in rebel held areas alone
these are people who suffer any one or all of the following <unk> of <unk> daily
barrel bombs randomly dropped <unk> made devices intended to <unk> kill and <unk>
<unk> rebel militia also fighting with the regime
radical islamic groups
shortages of food and water
people cutting down whatever trees they can find for fuel
and above all a sense for months now of <unk> that their world has only <unk> since the fight for aleppo began in june two thousand and twelve
that their fight has been deemed by some to be so <unk> and <unk> that the outside world has left aleppo to its own devices willing to help the winner but not to assist a victory
aleppo is the greatest prize in the fight for syria's north but also its greatest victim
aleppo the biggest city its commercial hub its cultural heart is a <unk> of what stood proudly merely three years ago
it is very difficult to gain independent access to aleppo
you can count on one hand the number of western tv channels who have done so in the past year
cnn last entered in june for six hours
kidnapping is now the major <unk>
after months of hospitality and risking themselves to assist journalists rebels now find their ranks <unk> by radicals and criminals who see foreign media often as a form of currency to help with boosting funds or dealing with another <unk>
isis
there are a few <unk> who through luck of contacts manage to <unk> the various <unk>
brazilian photojournalist gabriel <unk> managed to spend a month in aleppo with some of the more moderate rebel groups
they provided him access to their world
access to a school hidden away in a house where children still learn english
to an artist who <unk> the <unk> dead with paintings he <unk> out in a cave underground that also serves as a bomb shelter
and to the front lines where the battle for syria's largest city is being fought with a desperation not seen before
<unk> gained access to one key battle currently under way
and as in so much of syria's war it has been that way for months and will probably go on so as the outcome is so vital that nobody is prepared to give up
the fight for a small hill called <unk>
the hill and its associated settlement lies to the northeast of aleppo city on a vital road into the rebel held areas
the regime has a strong presence to its west and has been pushing up to the east for the past weeks
daily <unk> they push towards this raised bit of <unk> which if it were to fall into their control would allow them to shell the only roads in and out of rebel held areas effectively denying the rebels and the civilians who live among them their use
then many fear the siege of aleppo would begin
the regime has tried this <unk> dubbed <unk> or surrender before <unk> in <unk>
they <unk> an area deny its fighters and civilians food medicine everything
eventually the regime presents a deal
leave or surrender
the fear is that the fall of <unk> might present a similar opportunity for the regime
and then the humanitarian catastrophe currently <unk> inside rebel areas would <unk>
<unk> singer a spokesperson for unicef says the situation this winter in aleppo is very desperate regardless whether areas are control of the government control or armed opposition groups
<unk> diseases continue to spread partly because often as many as fifty to seventy displaced people share the same <unk>
there is no electricity or fuel for <unk> which leaves many people with the only choice of cutting trees from the public spaces and use them to heat the houses she says adding the situation is even harder for the displaced as many live in <unk> buildings or collective shelters where they have no windows doors or even walls
unicef estimates that sixty five thousand families risk being cut off from any assistance should the regime take <unk> hill that's about three hundred thousand people
another one hundred thousand children simply need warm clothes for this winter singer adds
that is around aleppo alone
this is the nightmare of being caught between a regime trying to <unk> them on one side and on the other the evil of isis trying to impose their radical <unk>
editor's note
<unk> <unk> is the author of <unk>
the life and times of jesus of <unk> and a professor of creative writing at the university of california <unk>
the opinions expressed in this commentary are his
the tragic murder of <unk>
<unk> <unk> by michael <unk> <unk> a recent convert to islam as every media outlet in the united states would like to remind you has added fuel to the already fiery debate in this country over the <unk> violent nature of religion in general and islam in particular
it seems that in the minds of many the only possible reason a muslim convert would go on a shooting <unk> in the canadian parliament is because his religious beliefs <unk> him to do so
of course it could very well be the case that <unk> <unk> was motivated by his islamic beliefs
it could be that he read a particular passage in the quran understood it to mean he should kill as many canadian government officials as possible and then went out and did just that
after all there's no question that a person's religious beliefs can and often do influence his or her behavior
the mistake lies in assuming there is a necessary and distinct <unk> connection between belief and behavior that <unk> actions were exclusively the result of his religious beliefs
the notion that there is a one to one <unk> between religious beliefs and behavior may seem obvious and self evident to those <unk> with the study of religion
but it has been repeatedly <unk> by social scientists who note that beliefs do not <unk> explain behavior and that behavior is in fact the result of complex <unk> among a host of social political cultural ethical emotional and yes religious factors
in the case of <unk> his violent behavior could have been influenced as much by his religious beliefs as by his documented mental problems his extensive criminal past or his history of drug addiction
yet because <unk> was a muslim it is simply <unk> that the <unk> <unk> factor for his abhorrent behavior was his religious beliefs
indeed there's even a term for this idea
sudden jihad syndrome an <unk> <unk> <unk> by the <unk> conservative commentator daniel <unk> to describe how any normal <unk> muslim can suddenly snap for no reason at all and go on a <unk> rampage
<unk> this <unk> connection between belief and behavior seems not to be as <unk> applied if the criminal in question claims a different religion than islam
take the example of the norwegian terrorist <unk> <unk> who slaughtered seventy seven people the majority of them children in two thousand and eleven
<unk> explicitly defined himself as a christian warrior fighting what he called an <unk> conflict with islam
nevertheless a great deal of the media coverage surrounding his actions seemed to take for granted that his crime had nothing to do with his christian identity that it was based instead on his right wing ideology or his anti immigrant views or his <unk> <unk> or even as <unk> <unk> ali famously argued because his view that europe will be <unk> by islam was being <unk> by a politically correct media leaving him no other choice but to use violence
all of the above <unk> for <unk> behavior including his religious beliefs are <unk> in understanding the <unk> for his behavior
but to argue that <unk> or <unk> actions were motivated solely by their religious beliefs or that their religious beliefs necessarily <unk> their actions is simply <unk>
and yet this <unk> has become <unk> common among some critics of religion
take the following <unk> from the <unk> book the end of faith by the anti <unk> activist sam harris
the link between belief and behavior raises the stakes <unk>
some <unk> are so dangerous that it may even be ethical to kill people for <unk> them
this may seem an extraordinary claim but it merely <unk> an ordinary fact about the world in which we live
certain beliefs place their <unk> beyond the reach of every peaceful means of <unk> while inspiring them to commit acts of extraordinary violence against others
there is in fact no talking to some people
if they can not be captured and they often can not otherwise <unk> people may be justified in killing them in self defense
harris argument is that a person's religious beliefs do not merely influence his or her behavior
they determine it
in other words people holding certain beliefs should be killed not because those beliefs may lead to violent behavior but because they necessarily will
therefore in order to save ourselves we may be justified in killing the <unk> before his or her beliefs turn into action as they <unk> will
it is true that religious beliefs can often lead to actions that <unk> basic human rights
it is also true that a great many of those actions are taking place right now among muslims
but it is ridiculous to claim that the actions of islamic extremists are either necessarily or exclusively the result of their belief in islam
there may be millions of muslims who share the ultra orthodox <unk> strain of islam called salafism that fuels the members of isis
but the u.s. is not at war with salafism
it is at war with isis and not because of what they believe but because of the actions they have carried out based on their interpretation of those beliefs
arguing otherwise leads to the <unk> conclusion that anyone who shares any measure of religious beliefs with a violent extremist is equally guilty for that <unk> violent actions regardless of how diverse the <unk> of those beliefs may be
in fact harris makes this exact point
given the link between belief and action it is clear that we can no more tolerate a diversity of religious beliefs than a diversity of beliefs about <unk> and basic hygiene
the danger of this mistaken view of the link between belief and action is that it makes it that much more difficult to counter religious violence
when we condemn an entire community of faith for sharing certain beliefs with extremists in their community we end up <unk> the very people who are best <unk> to counter such extremism in the first place
people should be free to believe whatever they want to believe no matter how <unk> those beliefs may appear to us just as people should be free to criticize those beliefs
it is when such beliefs lead to violent behavior that people of all faiths as well as those of no faith should <unk> in condemnation
badawi was sentenced to ten years in prison one thousand lashes and a fine of one million saudi arabian <unk> in may two thousand and fourteen by a saudi court accusing him of insulting islam said his wife and a source who followed the case closely

a <unk> would then be used to raise the section
search officials said that the underwater <unk> and currents are much better than conditions in previous days
experts say the information contained within the flight recorders is likely to enable investigators to figure out why flight qz eight thousand five hundred and one dropped off radar and went down in the sea on its way from the indonesian city of surabaya to singapore
the plane's pilot had asked to change course and climb to a higher altitude minutes before contact was lost according to indonesian officials
the vast majority of the people on the plane were indonesian

music fans often reach the height of <unk> as they crush themselves to the front of the stage in an effort to get as close to the <unk> as possible
entertainment photographer gabriel quintao has been capturing the faces in the crowd for a few years now and <unk> their <unk> to a battle scene
the idea of the <unk> is to drive the audience into a war environment quintao said about his front row project
the <unk> of gray with a lot of contrast associated with the dramatic faces and the desperate acts of the crowd gave me the drama i wanted
indeed the images he captures depict the <unk> and frustration someone might feel in conflict
but amid the pain there is also joy and excitement as music lovers get a taste of something most people at a concert do not
<unk> photographs from the rock in rio festival in rio de <unk> are up close personal and <unk>
the festival is one of the largest music concerts in the world and has brought together some of the most popular acts of their time
queen prince <unk> john <unk> <unk> and more recently <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
it draws hundreds of thousands of fans from all over the world to see and hear their favorite acts
but for some people it is the chance to show the <unk> how they feel about them
i realized that people who stay at the first row in these situations don't want just to listen to the music better or to see their idol closer quintao said
they want to prove love to the person on the stage and to prove to themselves that they're brave
the thirty year old photographer from <unk> <unk> brazil said the crowds who press forward during the music festival is mostly younger and male
however there is a woman he thinks is in her sixty s who is ever present at many of the venues and somehow makes her way to the first row
from <unk> photos it might appear that the action on the stage is <unk> to the rush in the crowd
quintao trains his camera on what he believes is the most unpredictable places to get the most emotional images at the events
sometimes the artist behind the <unk> just doesn't move the light doesn't change and a few pictures already present what the <unk> was he said
but the front row is always unpredictable
it changes every time
people reaching their physical limit just to be as close as possible to their idol is much more interesting than the planned and controlled situation happening on the stage
the subjects of his <unk> have described themselves as proud to go through such pain for their musical <unk> and they <unk> the front row is only for the real ones on the facebook page of his projects
people who face this situation until the end of the concert go home feeling they've received an honor <unk> for being strong quintao said
who wants to see the concert <unk> from an empty space
while he's never seen a serious injury from his position in the <unk> the space between the stage and the crowd quintao hopes his photos do justice to the level of emotions portrayed in the name of <unk>
he thinks the people in the front row believe they answer to a higher calling
the aim of this work is to show the power of <unk> he said
i wanted to show how a rock concert can be similar to a religion <unk> where sometimes people submit themselves to suffering just to prove their love to their idol

just inside the western walls of the old city of jerusalem beneath the tall <unk> era <unk> known <unk> as the tower of david <unk> this week proclaimed the discovery of the site of jesus trial by <unk> <unk> at which he was condemned to die by <unk>
more <unk>
they proclaimed the opening to visitors of the site which has now been <unk> and prepared for public viewing
without <unk> the precise location scholars have known for a long time that the trial must have taken place somewhere in this general <unk> despite the fact that tradition has put the spot of the trial on the very opposite side of the old city in the <unk> fortress
according to the gospel of matthew jesus trial before <unk> happened in a place called the <unk>
originally a term used to <unk> the tent of the general when <unk> for war and thus the place where the important military decisions were made <unk> came to <unk> the palace or administrative center for very high ranking officials
in jerusalem this was the palace of <unk> the great and according to ancient witnesses it was at <unk> palace that visiting roman <unk> like <unk> would hold any necessary trials during their visits to the capital city
these same ancient writers declared that <unk> palace was in the western part of jerusalem near the tower of david
on these grounds scholars have long <unk> indeed outright rejected the notion that the <unk> fortress on the northeastern side of the city was where the <unk> was located and the trial occurred
this most recent announcement is being hailed as a <unk> in large part because the <unk> fortress is the first station of the cross on the via <unk> the path that jesus is thought to have taken from his trial to his <unk> and burial at <unk> ending at the church of the holy <unk>
the via <unk> is an important <unk> site and a massive tourist <unk>
but if its first station is on the completely wrong side of the city then the whole thing is cast into doubt
the tower of david museum which is housing the exhibit of the newly discovered trial site is openly hoping to draw <unk> and other interested visitors and it is certain to get them
what should not be <unk> however is that an important <unk> <unk> about the life and death of jesus was effectively kept under <unk> for nearly fifteen years the discovery of <unk> palace beneath the tower of david was first made in two thousand and one as part of a museum expansion project
the timing of the announcement is linked entirely to the potential for tourist dollars rather than to the remarkable historical and religious significance of the discovery on its own terms
this may sound <unk> but it is <unk> for the course especially in jerusalem where the integration of history religion <unk> and tourism is at the very heart of the city's economy
it is a safe bet that this discovery will not significantly <unk> interest in walking the via <unk> customs and traditions are <unk> hard to break even with the best historical evidence
what is more likely to happen is that there will be two sites of jesus trial <unk> <unk> just as there are two sites of jesus burial
the church of the holy <unk> and the garden <unk>
jerusalem despite being <unk> by conflict remains one of the most religiously <unk> places on earth and that <unk> is nowhere better <unk> than in the sharing <unk> and often just <unk> old creating of religious sites
from a <unk> perspective however it is nice that in this case the significance for the tourism industry of an <unk> discovery really does match up with its significance in history
better fifteen years late than never
the <unk> space telescope <unk> the so called pillars of creation which the space agency describes as three giant <unk> of cold gas <unk> in the <unk> <unk> light from a cluster of young massive stars in a small region of the <unk> <unk> or m sixteen
the previous photo of these pillars taken in one thousand nine hundred and ninety five went on to stand out from all the rest of nasa's space images the agency said
the <unk> image is so popular that it has appeared in movies and television shows on t <unk> and <unk> and even on a <unk> <unk>
in celebration of the <unk> upcoming twenty five th anniversary in april <unk> returned to the pillars and this time with the latest high definition tools
the new <unk> and wider image was taken in near <unk> light as well as visible light nasa said
the <unk> view <unk> the pillars into <unk> <unk> <unk> seen against a background of <unk> stars
that's because the <unk> light <unk> much of the gas and dust except for the <unk> regions of the pillars
newborn stars can be seen hidden away inside the pillars
in one thousand nine hundred and ninety five the captured image gave insight into star <unk>
<unk> star forming regions like m sixteen are the <unk> <unk> signs that say we just made a bunch of massive stars here said paul <unk> of arizona state university who helped lead the original <unk> in a post on nasa's website
the new image <unk> that these <unk> are also pillars of destruction nasa said
the <unk> <unk> haze around the dense <unk> of the pillars is material getting heated up and <unk> away into space said <unk>
we have caught these pillars at a very unique and short lived moment in their evolution
the high profile prosecution of rios montt who is accused of allowing the <unk> of more than one thousand seven hundred indigenous <unk> <unk> in the early one thousand nine hundred and eighty s dates back to two thousand and twelve
he was convicted in may two thousand and thirteen a verdict that was overturned ten days later on <unk> grounds
after genocide trial has justice been done
a retrial which opened monday was characterized by the <unk> and delays that marked earlier proceedings
the accused did not show up in court
lawyers for rios montt argued that the eighty eight year old was too sick to attend the trial
rios montt has maintained since the beginning that he did not order the <unk>
the three judge panel rejected the motion to delay the trial because of rios <unk> health and ordered him to appear
rios montt eventually made his entrance strapped on a <unk> covered with a blanket and wearing <unk>
the <unk> judge <unk> <unk> called rios <unk> absence <unk> according to the state run <unk> news agency
then she herself became the object of further <unk>
the former <unk> defense demanded that <unk> <unk> herself because of a <unk> she wrote for a <unk> degree ten years ago
the topic of the paper
a legal analysis of the crime of genocide as it <unk> to the <unk> committed during the period rios montt was in power
the defense argued that <unk> had formed an opinion <unk> that genocide did occur in guatemala and therefore she could not be <unk>
the judges agreed that <unk> must <unk> herself and now the trial is suspended until an appeals court can name a new judge
it's not controversial that a judge steps aside because of a conflict of interest but it may have been a legal strategy by rios <unk> lawyers to wait until the first day of the trial to make their motion
<unk> <unk> was no secret the <unk> had been written about in the local press as early as two thousand and three
for observers the legal process against rios montt has been both historic and <unk> at times
the <unk> of rios montt by then attorney general <unk> paz y paz was hailed by human rights groups
in guatemala like other latin american countries who lived through <unk> of violence and human rights violations at the hands of the government there were amnesty laws to protect those in power
the first trial against rios montt represented the first time that a former head of state was tried for genocide by his own nation's judicial system
the first trial was almost <unk> several times
lawyers for rios montt <unk> more than seventy <unk> and appeals many seeking to end the process on technical or <unk> grounds
in the end the trial was completed and the guilty verdict came down
in a nation where the powerful and the political elite have historically been able to act with impunity the moment was big
ten days later however a higher court <unk> the conviction and ordered a retrial a move critics considered politically motivated
some observers say they saw the invisible hand of the political elite at work when a court ordered paz y paz the attorney general who indicted rios montt to step down seven months before her term was to <unk>
shortly afterward the judge who handed down the guilty verdict against rios montt <unk> <unk> was suspended by the <unk> bar association for alleged ethics violations
there's no <unk> evidence that the actions against paz y paz and <unk> are retaliation for their role in prosecuting <unk> one time dictator but the sentiment among many is that this is exactly what happened
the first trial <unk> <unk> complicated relationship with its own history as both protesters and supporters rallied outside the <unk> last year
rios montt came to power in a march one thousand nine hundred and eighty two coup only to be <unk> eighteen months later
during the trial prosecutors argued that rios <unk> <unk> government <unk> the <unk> period of the country's one thousand nine hundred and sixty one thousand nine hundred and ninety six civil war that left more than two hundred thousand people dead and one million refugees according to various truth commission reports
the statement doesn't so much <unk> off my <unk> as it <unk> out of my mouth as i look at the <unk> <unk> of <unk> on the <unk> head of a <unk> stork
others on the boat <unk> similar sentiments
it's one of the ugly five says amos our captain and guide on an afternoon safari cruise at <unk> game reserve in <unk> <unk> river delta
his enthusiasm feels <unk> for such a <unk> bird
safaris tend to focus on the so called big five lions <unk> buffalo rhinos elephants but the ugly five makes for a fun alternative for anyone who's already checked off the safari stars
the list runs like a cast call for the lion king's least majestic animals
<unk> stork hyena <unk> <unk> and <unk>
and we're here to meet them all
the <unk> stork doesn't just rely on its looks it's also got a <unk> thing going down
they can grow up to five feet long says amos as we get close enough to see the <unk> looking <unk> of one these large birds
and be glad it's not close enough that you can <unk> him
everyone except our guide <unk> as the bird <unk> its <unk> twelve foot wings and takes off from a tree giving us a full view of its <unk> and <unk> throat <unk>
the <unk> delta is one of two <unk> grounds for the <unk> stork
during <unk> season the birds are known to eat live <unk> including adult <unk>
the stork also goes by the name of the <unk> bird in recognition of the grim but important role it plays in the delta reducing diseases and <unk> up the ecosystem by <unk> <unk> <unk>
one the next <unk> bush walk we get lucky in spotting a hyena
we're certainly <unk> than the <unk> dead animal it's <unk>
your nose is the strongest <unk> of game says amos
apparently your <unk> are the second but we're <unk> to the <unk> presence not by its <unk> <unk> laugh but by the sound of the bones it's <unk>
we peer over the brush to see a spotted hyena with its <unk> in the stomach of an <unk>
before anyone can ask our guide says
it probably didn't <unk> this <unk> from lions
<unk> are very successful hunters
the hyena <unk> low on the <unk> meter
this one couldn't get any more ugly unless it was covered in blood
which it is
my friend <unk> <unk> claiming that <unk> are so <unk> they're actually <unk>
they're only ugly because they're <unk> in movies she says
showing me a photo of a hyena <unk> her sister took in south africa's kruger national park she adds the babies are so <unk>
that's <unk> but they certainly get <unk> with age
as we're watching our hyena <unk> its bloody face out of the <unk> revealing its <unk> neck <unk> <unk> and dirty <unk> <unk>
with one of the strongest <unk> in the animal world <unk> don't leave much for <unk>
even so where there are <unk> there are usually <unk>
while the <unk> is the only species of stork on the list the entire <unk> family can claim <unk> to the ugly club
<unk> overhead in a flying <unk> the <unk> we see aren't too bad to look at
their wings <unk> <unk> against the blue sky
the <unk> is broken when a few fly down to compete with the hyena for <unk> meat revealing that though they have the wings of an <unk> they have the face of <unk> kruger
it's no surprise the <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> have inspired a <unk> <unk> <unk>
their <unk> is efficient says amos
the <unk> <unk> is effective in <unk> meat according to our guide
the <unk> <unk> feature the <unk> head and neck is easy to keep clean after eating <unk>
<unk> it's the stuff of <unk>
the <unk> is another case of <unk> over <unk>
these wild pigs are <unk> with useful but <unk> <unk> on both sides of their faces landing them firmly in the ugly crowd
the <unk> protect the faces of male <unk> when they fight even if they do look like surgery gone wrong
<unk> are <unk> in the <unk> delta
anywhere out of <unk> range from <unk> we see <unk> families <unk> for roots with their front <unk>
together with <unk> <unk> <unk> down their backs and <unk> body hair the <unk> is the least appealing pig in the delta
their bodies seem <unk> <unk> in comparison to their <unk> legs and short necks
as we're watching a mother and two babies someone in our group steps on a <unk> and <unk> them
we're treated to the beautiful sight of <unk> <unk> with <unk> straight up in the air
during an afternoon heading out from the <unk> <unk> crossing resort in a <unk> dug out canoe we cross paths with the last of the ugly five
<unk>
as we <unk> from one end of the small <unk> to another a dozen weary black faces with <unk> <unk> <unk> us down perhaps concerned we might try to eat them
because they're one of the most populous safari animals and not much to look at many people don't <unk> to photograph them says amos
as the <unk> cousin of the more <unk> <unk> and <unk> the <unk> is a <unk> genetic <unk>
it has the head of a buffalo body of an <unk> and tail of a <unk> horse
its <unk> face is connected to a dirty looking neck <unk> and features a mouth shaped and used like a <unk>
<unk> gray bodies decorated with black and white <unk> add to the <unk> appearance
its <unk> is no problem for <unk> they're practically blind amos <unk>
the only way to get to <unk> crossing is by small plane followed by a five minute boat ride
the guided cruise bush walk and <unk> rides are part of all <unk> <unk> for guests
the scottish <unk> is appealing for information on facebook after the male <unk> <unk> <unk> was discovered friday night tied to a <unk> outside the <unk> train station
beside him was a <unk> with some of the dog's belongings including a <unk> toy a <unk> and food
heart <unk> photos of the <unk> dog attracted thousands of shares and sympathetic comments on social media with many people condemning his former owner
poor <unk> what a thing to do to him wrote one woman on facebook
i hope his future is <unk>
<unk> inspector <unk> taylor said the dog is <unk> allowing authorities to find out his name
kai
the <unk> contacted the owner registered to the <unk> who said they had sold kai online in two thousand and thirteen but did not know the address of the person who bought him
this case highlights the potential consequences of selling an animal online as it often leads to the impulse buying of <unk> that people know very little about taylor said in a post on the scottish <unk> website
regardless of the fact kai was left with his belongings this was still a cruel incident and we are keen to identify the person responsible
if anyone can help we would ask them to get in touch as soon as possible
a woman from <unk> scotland told the daily record on friday that the dog's <unk> was the result of an attempted sale gone wrong
the woman said she responded to an online ad and agreed to buy the dog for about six hundred dollar but changed her mind once she arrived at the <unk> train station to meet the <unk>
i went to buy a dog but the dog was not the same as the picture <unk> she told the record
the <unk> then took off in his car leaving the <unk> she said
the woman said she considered taking the dog home but <unk> and left him tied to the <unk> because she had to catch the last train to <unk> with her daughter who <unk> from <unk>
meanwhile the <unk> has been <unk> with requests from people wanting to <unk> the dog
taylor of the <unk> said kai is about two to three years old and is a <unk> dog with a nice nature
we will look after him until we can find him a permanent and loving home
some people noted that <unk> plight <unk> that of <unk> the <unk> bear in a series of popular kids books who was adopted by a family after they found him sitting on his <unk> at <unk> railway station in london
<unk> an animal is an offense under <unk> animal health and welfare act and anyone found guilty of doing so can expect to be banned from keeping animals for a fixed period or even life
the small airport serving the southwest england port city has emerged as the world's most <unk> aviation hub in two thousand and fourteen <unk> some of the biggest destinations on the planet
with connections to europe and north africa <unk> managed to get ninety four point four percents of its flights on or off the ground within fifteen minutes of schedule according to <unk> from uk based aviation data monitors <unk>
it's a figure that might <unk> officials at the main airports serving london including europe's busiest at heathrow none of which made the top rankings with the exception of london <unk>
that puts it top of the league not only for small airports but also larger facilities
john grant <unk> executive vice president says the findings of his company's first annual <unk> league were positive although many leading <unk> would probably be looking to up their game in two thousand and fifteen
with many airports and airlines achieving in excess of ninety percents on time performance within fifteen minutes of schedule there is a lot to celebrate he said
european destinations dominated the <unk> list when it comes to small airports with <unk> followed closely by brussels south charleroi airport at ninety three point one percents and berlin <unk> at ninety two point three percents
japan's <unk> international airport claimed the top spot for medium sized airports with ninety three point two percents followed by moscow <unk> and <unk> airport
the most <unk> large air hub was named as <unk> airport a fact <unk> do little to <unk> <unk> of german <unk> but one that also highlights the five year delay to <unk> still <unk> <unk> airport
<unk> was followed by tokyo <unk> at eighty seven point nine percents and <unk> sea <unk> airport at eighty six point two percents
the world's busiest air destination atlanta was ranked twelve th on the large airports list with a score of eighty two point four percents
dubai at fourteen th with eighty two point three percents was the only middle eastern airport to make any of the top <unk>
in a week when it emerged that passengers spent twenty eight hours stuck on a delayed flight from abu dhabi to san <unk> <unk> rankings for the world's most <unk> airlines makes interesting reading
smaller operations again took the lead with <unk> <unk> <unk> all others at ninety four point nine percents
second and third were <unk> airlines at ninety two point three percents and <unk> airlines at ninety percents
the rest of the top ten includes
<unk> <unk> saudi arabian airlines <unk> japan airlines <unk> and <unk> airlines
norwegian air shuttle was named the most <unk> low cost carrier with almost nine out of ten flights <unk> to schedule
it was followed by thai airasia and <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> out happy birthday not far from <unk> <unk> rendition as the pyongyang crowd <unk> in <unk> during a basketball game
this year's birthday affairs are less likely to be bizarre <unk> is not in town
kim's birthday is believed to fall on january eight but like most affairs of north korea his personal details are <unk>
north korean state media has not acknowledged the exact date of kim's birth in either of its korean and english language <unk>
there is a lot of debate about the year he was born said <unk> <unk> <unk> a senior research fellow at the <unk> institute a korean think <unk>
some say it is one thousand nine hundred and eighty four while others say is eighty three or eighty two
in previous years kim has distributed sweets to children on january seven which was a tradition held by his grandfather and father during their <unk>
the birthday of kim il <unk> the founder of the country is considered the day of the sun and falls on april fifteen
kim jong <unk> birthday on february sixteen is known as the day of the <unk> star
these are the days when residents received goods from the state and children got sweets
the days are marked with <unk> and <unk> including military <unk> patriotic <unk> and <unk> of <unk> to the leaders
but the current leader kim's birthday has been decidedly more low key during his three years in power
there's a lot of speculation why that's the case said lee <unk> <unk> professor of international relations at <unk> university in south korea
kim could be trying to put out this image as a humble guy that he's not <unk>
then there's sort of negative take on this issue as to he's still very young twenty nine thirty or thirty one
when you start marking his birthday then the whole north korean people will start to wonder then what's his age
and revealing his age raises questions about experience
it could be because he is a young leader
being young could have its advantage and <unk> but it appears as though he doesn't want to make it public yet said <unk>
unlike his <unk> there's little sign that kim's birthday is a major national holiday
the <unk> news reported last year that the current north korean <unk> birthday is not likely to be celebrated as a national holiday this year after it reviewed five north korean <unk> for two thousand and fifteen
and north korean workers at the joint <unk> industrial complex never have asked for a holiday on january eight in the past two years according to the south korean <unk> ministry the agency which <unk> north korean affairs
his birth date was first revealed by kenji <unk> the former <unk> chef of kim's father kim jong il
the date is known as accurate but north korea never officially confirmed it said <unk>
the <unk> ministry recorded kim's birthday as january eight although the exact year of birth is marked as one thousand nine hundred and eighty two one thousand nine hundred and eighty three or one thousand nine hundred and eighty four
in kim's three years in power he's largely followed the <unk> of his father and grandfather said lee
a south korean report that released this week indicated that north korea could be closer to <unk> a nuclear <unk> indicating that kim has continued with the focus on nuclear weapons
and his regime has also been marked by the <unk> of kim's uncle jang song <unk> who was executed after being branded a <unk> in december two thousand and thirteen
unfortunately there were some hopes because he was educated in switzerland and that he's young people hoped that there might be some change
none of that has happened
it might be worse because he's less experienced than his father and grandfather and very <unk> and <unk> as we've seen with the cyberattacks lee said referring to a sony hacking scandal in which the fbi blamed north korea
editor's note
retired lt. gen. mark <unk> former commander of u.s. army europe served in the army for more than thirty seven years and spent more than three years in iraq
he was the director for war plans on the joint staff on september eleven and has extensive experience in strategy development and implementation
he is a cnn military analyst
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author
the uniform
all the attackers are uniform in appearance
all have <unk> capable of holding multiple magazines of ammunition for their weapons and perhaps grenades
additionally they are all wearing what appear to be heavy <unk>
that could indicate either body <unk> or possibly suicide <unk> underneath to be detonated if captured
some experts are suggesting they came to kill not to die but those of us with experience in these kinds of encounters might suggest they came to kill until they are trapped then they will <unk> die if they can kill more by <unk> a suicide vest as a last resort
use of weapons
the terrorists were wielding ak forty seven s according to police spokesman <unk> <unk> but at least one of them also appeared to have a military three point <unk> attached to the weapon
these <unk> are used in close in attacks
the driver does not appear to have this <unk> which allows for freedom in the car
the attackers appear to be good <unk> as <unk> by the tight shot of a group of bullets that <unk> the <unk> of a french police car shown in several photographs at the scene
additionally the attackers have their weapons on <unk> automatic versus full automatic
many terrorists use what u.s. soldiers <unk> call the pray and spray method
that is they point their weapons on full automatic <unk> a religious slogan and let loose with a stream of bullets most of which don't hit the targets
these terrorists appear well trained with aimed fire single shots and controlled targeting
fire and <unk>
these terrorists appear to have been trained in movement techniques
they use cover and aim fire while their terrorist <unk> <unk> to a new firing location
at that point the moving terrorist aims and fires while the previously covering terrorist moves to join him
<unk>
the attack occurred at <unk> in busy paris yet there was no traffic on the side streets where the citizens filming took place
additionally initial reports indicate that an editors meeting was occurring at that time with all the subjects in one room
that indicates there was intelligence route planning and then individual requirements for the members of the terrorist team
speed
they moved fast knew where they are going did their job and then they were gone
again that's <unk> of <unk> but also single <unk> of mission
selection of target
this was a follow on attack
the offices of charlie hebdo had been previously <unk> but that attack was not successful
much like the initial world trade center bombing in one thousand nine hundred and ninety three that was followed by the two thousand and one attack these terrorists were again going after the same target
usually terrorists film their attacks for future information operations and social media use
they may have had terrorist <unk> in specific locations for that purpose during this attack as well
those videos may appear in the future but until then french citizens posting youtube videos contribute to the terrorists information campaign
in the next few hours and days other countries of europe especially germany and italy will be interested in sharing information from this attack as they face similar threats from muslim extremists
france the european union and interpol will share information and given the ability of the terrorists to move <unk> through europe this passing of information will be critical
the passport free <unk> area allows for movement through twenty six countries in europe on the <unk> and <unk> so while initially this is an attack on france these terrorists are a threat to all of europe
they had taken shelter from three armed men who had just opened fire against their colleagues during the weekly satirical <unk> editorial committee
events unfolded very rapidly from then on
french president franois hollande was very quick on the scene the terrorist nature of the events was confirmed almost immediately and so was the shocking number of casualties
twelve dead and eleven injured some critically
the operation appeared to have been prepared in a military style with weapons of war
what can cartoonists with their pen and paper do against killers with automatic weapons
then the dead were given names this is probably when the news really sank in
the cartoonists with the <unk> de <unk> charb cabu wolinski and tignous known to millions in france had been <unk> at point blank range
cabu and wolinski in particular both in their late seventy s have accompanied generations of french people and made them laugh every week in many different <unk> on radio and on television for over fifty years
i heard people unable to finish their sentences forced to hang up the phone on learning the news too moved to speak
i saw shoppers stopping in their tracks sinking lost onto benches others in tears when learning the news from a <unk> call
as u.s. secretary john kerry later commented both in french and english from washington
france gave democracy to the world and knows better than most the price of liberty
the french have been <unk> reminded that <unk> <unk> <unk> values they fought hard to see every day on the <unk> of their schools and public buildings are threatened by terrorists
while their identities have not yet been confirmed france with the largest muslim community in the western world has always been a prime target for islamist extremists
in one thousand nine hundred and ninety five paris <unk> from a wave of terrorist attacks by the algerian <unk> which killed a total of twelve people
in one thousand nine hundred and eighty six the hezbollah had carried another deadly attack bombing the grand <unk> <unk> and killing eight <unk> by
french secret services were notoriously good at preventing such plots and president hollande today revealed that many planned attacks had been very recently foiled
there will be a lot of soul searching in the next weeks and months within the french and president hollande is facing difficult questions and an enormous task
with the far right of marine le pen <unk> the flames of national divisions and blaming immigration for france's many social and economic problems and the left trying very hard not to <unk> its muslim citizens there is little space left for a <unk> and calm public debate
the news that the french writer michel <unk> is now under police protection as a result of today's attack on charlie hebdo means that the french interior ministry takes no chances with terrorism but it also shows the depth of the <unk> at the heart of french society
<unk> latest novel takes place in two thousand and twenty two during the presidential elections
after a second round between the far right and a french islamist the islamists are rise to victory with the help of the liberal left and france is <unk> as an islamic state
today a french imam called the dead journalists and cartoonists of charlie hebdo martyrs of freedom
but france may have also discovered the price of its <unk> and learned that such <unk> should never be taken for granted
charlie hebdo

once again australian airline <unk> <unk> the top spot
<unk> continues to lead the industry with safety innovations and its fleet is now the youngest seven point nine years it has been since the airline was <unk> in one thousand nine hundred and ninety five airlineratings dot com editor <unk> thomas tells cnn
he says the airline is an industry <unk> for best practice and has taken the lead in virtually every major <unk> in airline safety over the past sixty years
<unk> out the rest of the top ten in <unk> order are
air new zealand british airways <unk> pacific airways emirates <unk> airways <unk> air <unk> <unk> and singapore airlines
our top ten safest airlines are always at the <unk> of safety innovation and launching new planes says thomas
airlineratings dot <unk> <unk> system takes into account <unk> from <unk> governing bodies and lead <unk> as well as government <unk> and the airlines <unk> records
it also <unk> airlines operational <unk> incident records and operational <unk>
of the the four hundred and forty nine airlines it monitors one hundred and forty nine have the top seven star safety ranking
this year the site also included a list of the top ten safest low cost airlines for two thousand and fifteen
these are in <unk> order
<unk> <unk> <unk> airlines <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> dot com monarch airlines thomas <unk> <unk> and <unk>
unlike a number of low cost carriers these airlines have all passed the <unk> international air transport association operational safety <unk> <unk> and have excellent safety records says thomas
low cost does not mean low safety
one fatal accident for every one point three million flights
the release of the airlineratings dot com list comes at a particularly sensitive time for <unk>
while two thousand and thirteen was one of the safest years in global aviation history two thousand and fourteen is considered one of the worst in recent years in terms of fatalities due to several high profile air incidents
airlineratings dot com says there were twenty one fatal accidents with nine hundred and eighty six fatalities in two thousand and fourteen higher than the ten year average
however looking to the positive there were only one hundred and eleven crashes in two thousand and fourteen the lowest number in more than eighty years says the geneva based bureau of aircraft accidents <unk> or baaa
the last time the world had one hundred and eleven crashes was in one thousand nine hundred and twenty seven
if you consider sheer numbers of aircraft crashes flying today is safer says <unk> ray an analyst with the international bureau of aviation a global aviation consulting group
however there are more aircraft in the sky so naturally the overall number may appear similar to previous decades and in some <unk> of disaster higher
according to a report on airlineratings dot com the world's airlines carried a record three point three billion passengers on twenty seven million flights in two thousand and fourteen
<unk> fifty years and there were a staggering eighty seven crashes killing one thousand five hundred and ninety seven when airlines carried only one hundred and forty one million passengers five percents of today's number says the website
another <unk> is that fatal accidents for two thousand and fourteen were at a record low twenty one one for every one point three million flights
two of the crashes last year mh three hundred and seventy and mh seventeen were unprecedented in modern times and claimed five hundred and thirty seven lives
in march malaysia airlines flight three hundred and seventy disappeared en route from <unk> <unk> to beijing with two hundred and thirty nine aboard
officials believe that plane is somewhere in the indian ocean
but nearly ten months later mh three hundred and seventy hasn't been found
in july malaysia airlines flight seventeen was shot down over eastern ukraine killing all two hundred and ninety eight aboard
malaysia airlines has a five out of seven ranking on airlineratings dot com
airasia indonesia still <unk> from the crash of flight qz eight thousand five hundred and one which went down over the java sea on december twenty eight with one hundred and sixty two people on board has a four out of seven star ranking
prior to december airasia had a near <unk> safety record with no previous fatal accidents
airlineratings dot com says if an airline has a crash that involves the death of a passenger and or crew members it will <unk> receive a <unk> of one star giving it a lower safety <unk>
a crash involving fatalities carries with it a one star <unk> for ten years from the date of the incident says the website on a page explaining its <unk> system
of the four hundred and forty nine airlines surveyed by airlineratings dot com nearly fifty have just three stars or less
four airlines only achieved one star for safety
two are from nepal <unk> air and nepal airlines joining <unk> <unk> airlines and <unk> <unk> air
all four are on a list of airlines banned from flying within the european union
the united states doesn't <unk> individual airlines but it does make public a list of countries it judges to fall short of international aviation safety standards

how bad was two thousand and fourteen
to scientists it's something more
evidence of the drought that is suspected to have led to the <unk> of the <unk> civilization
the team <unk> <unk> from the blue hole <unk> and a nearby <unk>
they found that the <unk> of <unk> to <unk> changed in the ninth and ten th centuries a period when the <unk> civilization in the <unk> peninsula went into decline
more <unk> means that heavier rains were <unk> the region since the <unk> from the <unk> <unk> rock is rich in the element
but from about <unk> eight hundred to one thousand the <unk> between the two elements was much smaller indicating that there was much less rainfall
when you have major <unk> you start to get <unk> and unrest <unk> said
the <unk> civilization noted for its advances in <unk> and agriculture dominated the <unk> in the first half of the first millennium <unk>
but by nine hundred most of the <unk> cities located in present day guatemala el <unk> <unk> and southern mexico had been abandoned
the question of why this happened has <unk> scientists and historians for decades
the drought theory isn't new but the findings of <unk> and his colleagues <unk> other studies
in two thousand and twelve samples from a two thousand year old <unk> also showed that drought had <unk> the region in the latter half of the first millennium <unk>
the main finding was that a prolonged drought contributed to the collapse of classic <unk> civilization environmental <unk> douglas <unk> told <unk> two years ago

but mystery surrounds how the thirty nine year old <unk> lost his life
no damage was found to either his body or <unk> said race director <unk> <unk>
<unk> who was located just a few hundred meters from the race track had removed his <unk> prior to his death
the circumstances surrounding his death have yet to be determined as the <unk> did not show any external signs of an accident said a rally statement
<unk> who was competing in his first <unk> was found at kilometer two hundred and six on the stage between san juan and <unk> in northern argentina
shortly after the <unk> wearing <unk> number eighty two failed to appear at the finish line organizers tried to find him
the search was complicated by the absence of a signal from his satellite <unk>
when the race management detected the loss of his <unk> signal and was informed that he had not completed the special stage at fifteen sixteen it decided to start a search for the <unk> at fifteen twenty three said a statement
an ambulance helicopter found the <unk> three hundred meters off the route at sixteen three
unfortunately the on board doctor could only confirm the <unk> death
<unk> death means five competitors have died since the rally moved from west africa to south america in two thousand and nine because of security concerns in the <unk> region
all those five have been competing in the <unk> section
since the <unk> began on december twenty six one thousand nine hundred and seventy eight a total of twenty four competitors have died but there have been over fifty fatalities when including the deaths of <unk> and officials
speaking after the stage the overall leader of the <unk> race <unk> <unk> <unk> said it had been a challenging section
it was really dangerous because we were on river <unk> with a lot of stones and broken up tracks all day the <unk> told reporters
race organizers said <unk> had previously <unk> and completed both the two thousand and thirteen morocco rally and the two thousand and fourteen abu dhabi desert challenge
the whole <unk> family offers its condolences to <unk> family close friends and team added the <unk> statement
the concept has been around since the one thousand nine hundred and forty s when science fiction writer <unk> <unk> <unk> the idea of a robot manned space station that delivered energy to earth via microwaves
today the idea is less science fiction than a steadily advancing reality
the united states china india and japan all have projects at various <unk> of development that would see robots <unk> solar <unk> that could provide the earth with massive amounts of clean and <unk> energy delivered <unk>
some <unk> of the idea could even see as much as one <unk> of energy <unk> to <unk> on earth enough to power a large city
according to dr paul jaffe <unk> engineer at the us <unk> research laboratory the concept is <unk> sound
nasa and the us department of energy did a study in the late seventy s that cost twenty million dollar at the time and looked at it in pretty great depth dr jaffe told cnn
the conclusion at that time was that there was nothing wrong with the physics but the real question is the economics
the cost lies in the number of space launches required to build the power <unk> satellite
with costs as high as forty thousand dollar per kilogram for some space launches the final price <unk> for the first space based solar power station could be as high as twenty billion dollar
while the recent entry of private space companies stands significantly to cut costs basic physics <unk> that getting <unk> into space is still an expensive <unk>
the subject is <unk> every ten years when the technology changes and some of the factors <unk> the economics change
he said the wars in the middle east gave new <unk> to the space based solar power as scientific researchers with the military <unk> with the problems of delivering energy to troops in hostile areas
multiple and potentially hidden <unk> could tap space based solar power and <unk> the military of the expensive and often dangerous task of <unk> troops with <unk> diesel by either road or air he said
if you could deliver electricity from space that would be kind of <unk> he said
two proven ways of getting the power to earth exist in the form of either laser <unk> or microwaves
the laser <unk> option would involve sending small laser <unk> satellites into space at the relatively low cost of between five hundred million dollar and one billion dollar
the self <unk> satellite would lower costs and the small diameter of the laser <unk> would make it easier to collect on the ground
but at just one <unk> to ten <unk> per satellite many satellites would be needed to provide enough energy
as well as this laser <unk> satellites would have difficulty <unk> power through clouds and rain
the <unk> option would have the advantage of <unk> transmission through rain <unk> or any other atmospheric conditions and could provide <unk> of power
<unk> technology dr jaffe explained has been established for decades
as early as one thousand nine hundred and sixty four scientists were able to power a helicopter using microwaves
dr jaffe said with a large receiving area the energy from the microwaves was so <unk> that it would present no danger to life
the chief <unk> however is the fact that as many as one hundred launches into space would be required to <unk> the space stations with costs running into tens of billions
unfortunately too from a public relations <unk> both microwaves and <unk> have negative <unk> for most people because they associate microwaves with the <unk> in their kitchen and <unk> with science fiction space battles dr jaffe said
his research is currently <unk> on the so called <unk> module the part of the solar array that actually <unk> the <unk> into power
one side of the <unk> receives solar energy with a <unk> panel <unk> in the middle convert the current into a radio <unk> and the other side has an <unk> to <unk> it away
people might not associate radio waves with carrying energy says jaffe because they think of them for communications like radio tv or cell phones
they don't think about them as carrying <unk> amounts of power
despite the technology already being available for space based solar power dr jaffe believes the first space power station is still decades away even though the japanese have already made it one of the pillars of their space program
without the similar research base that we have in the united states for say <unk> energy it's unlikely to make meaningful progress he said
if the japanese make progress in the next five years people might start to notice and say why aren't we doing that here
ultimately he said space based solar energy is like most novel ideas

its surface is hot enough to melt lead and its atmospheric pressure is the equivalent of diving a mile underwater

the <unk> at this altitude is only slightly lower than that of earth its atmospheric pressure is similar and the <unk> provides enough protection from solar radiation to make it no more dangerous than taking a trip to canada
known at nasa as havoc high altitude venus operational concept engineers and scientists at the systems analysis and <unk> <unk> at nasa's <unk> research center in <unk> virginia have been working on a preliminary <unk> study on how robots and humans could make a venus mission a reality
the atmosphere of venus is an exciting destination for both further scientific study and future human exploration said <unk> engineer christopher <unk> jones of the space mission analysis branch
one concept is a <unk> than air vehicle that could carry either a host of instruments and <unk> or a habitat and <unk> vehicle for a crew of two astronauts to explore venus for up to a month
he said the study showed the mission would require less time to complete than <unk> missions to other <unk> and could even be a practice run for a mars mission
venus has the advantage of being much closer to earth
its minimum distance to earth is thirty eight million kilometers compared with fifty four point six million to mars
the kind of multi decade mission that we believe could succeed would be an <unk> program for the exploration of venus with focus on the mission architecture and vehicle concept for a thirty day <unk> mission into <unk> atmosphere he said
at the heart of the concept is the <unk> difficult task of sending a <unk> into the atmosphere of venus without landing it
the havoc model involves placing the astronauts inside an <unk> that would enter the atmosphere at four thousand five hundred miles per hour
<unk> during its descent to just four hundred and fifty meters per second and then <unk> a <unk> the shell would fall away to reveal a <unk> <unk>
robotic arms would <unk> the <unk> which would be <unk> with <unk> to allow the <unk> to <unk> thirty miles above the planet's fiery surface
jones said the key technical challenges for the mission include performing the <unk> <unk> at venus and earth <unk> and <unk> the <unk> and protecting the solar <unk> and structure from the <unk> acid in the atmosphere
with advances in technology and further <unk> of the concept missions to the <unk> atmosphere can expand <unk> future in space he said
suspended in a <unk> beneath the <unk> astronauts would not have to <unk> with the physical challenges of zero <unk> where <unk> causes <unk> to <unk> and bones to <unk>
and at a mere one hundred and sixty seven degrees fahrenheit just thirty degrees fahrenheit <unk> than the highest temperature ever recorded on earth even current technology has the ability to <unk> with everything that venus could throw at the mission
even so havoc is <unk> as a multi phase campaign and robotic missions would have to be sent to test technologies and better understand the atmosphere
while nasa has no current plans to fund the concept the <unk> based team continues its work with the hope the space agency could make the plan come to <unk> within several decades
eventually a short <unk> human mission would allow us to gain experience having humans live at another world with the hope that it would <unk> be possible to live in the atmosphere permanently jones said
wind farms of the future go underwater
is the <unk> a glimpse into the web of the future

for dr. <unk> <unk> <unk> one of the leading researchers on the <unk> project it's a serious question
making an idiot proof flying car that anyone can pilot has involved years of <unk> research and may be the secret to the long held dream of firing up the <unk> <unk> and simply flying out of the <unk> to <unk> <unk>
now the european union wants to make the dream a reality <unk> the <unk> of small commuter air vehicles to ease the world's traffic <unk>
it's been a dream of mine since i read it in science fiction books and in the movies as a kid but science fiction is becoming the reality these days says dr. <unk> director of perception <unk> and action at the <unk> <unk> institute in <unk> germany
under the four year project the eu has drawn together six <unk> from across europe to look at the problems associated with <unk> in personal aviation vehicles
at the center of the research is a focus not so much on building the vehicle but on all the issues and challenges surrounding commuter aviation
in the case of his institute it's how to make the machine accessible to ordinary drivers
there's no intention with this project to actually build the system explains <unk> whose research is part of a two thousand and seven eu report called out of the box
ideas about the future of air transport
they said to us please not another proposal for a flying vehicle we have received so many there are so many other issues to address he said
these challenges involve setting up virtual corridor traffic systems in the sky that guide <unk> under existing aircraft using advances in <unk> technology to stop them <unk> into each other and working on landing systems that do not involve air traffic controllers
if you want to make a flying car it should be for everybody but you can't make every car driver into a pilot he said
the idea is to fly in <unk> airspace without <unk> with all the other aircraft
he said the plan is to make the flying vehicles so intelligent they communicate with each other and avoid <unk> without any human <unk>
his institute in particular is focused on the problems of the human machine <unk>
creating a design that <unk> the <unk> array of <unk> and monitors in a helicopter or plane into a few simple controls on a <unk>
keeping the simple <unk> wheel on a flying vehicle where controls must make <unk> for traveling through three rather than two <unk> has been just one of the challenges of the project
for more than one hundred years cars have used the <unk> wheel
it was a good idea for cars but if you make the transition to the air why should a driver learn something completely new
he said
the aircraft would be largely <unk> and would for the most part need no <unk> at all
flying through <unk> in the sky flight paths designed to host <unk> of <unk> flying in <unk> the <unk> would avoid obstacles and select landing spots <unk> by using intelligent sight sensors
the controls would be shared between the pilot and the machine allowing for what researchers call <unk> <unk> awareness
so called <unk> controls that put a feeling of resistance in the <unk> wheel would allow drivers to know when they were <unk> towards the <unk> of the highway in the sky
other aspects of the study have looked at the social impact of <unk> as the commuter vehicle of the future
many people might ask whether we really want thousands of these things <unk> around in the sky dr <unk> said
researchers have been looking at ways of <unk> <unk> flight paths above existing <unk> and roads to <unk> the environmental impact keeping the flight ceiling at fifty meters to avoid commercial aircraft
while flying time is relatively short due to the <unk> of battery life using current technology researchers on the project had found that ninety <unk> of commuter trips were shorter than twenty five km and <unk> about thirty minutes with peak hour delays of about fifteen minutes making a <unk> perfect for short hop journeys from work to home
dr <unk> said recent advances and social <unk> of <unk> <unk> car had given real hope to researchers on the project
that really makes me very optimistic he said
the car industry has been producing the same basic model of <unk> for more than one hundred years
google is doing something that is making the car industry wake up
i would never have expected that several states in the united states have <unk> <unk> driving for example
even so there are many issues still to be examined
<unk> for instance if there's no driver we don't know who's responsible in case of a crash
these questions still need to be answered
while the <unk> car is now a reality he says it might be some time yet before anyone can walk into a <unk> and buy a personal aviation vehicle
the <unk> is to have them available by two thousand and fifty says dr <unk>
but i am not likely to be around in two thousand and fifty so i'm quietly optimistic that we will have one before that
can this one <unk> wonder change the way you <unk> to work
will people still be useful in the twenty one st century
the green man in your traffic lights just got new super powers
at least thirty eight people were killed and dozens others were injured in a car bomb explosion in front of the police college in the yemeni capital sanaa wednesday morning two top interior ministry officials told cnn
the bomber <unk> his vehicle in the middle of the road and then boarded another that was waiting for him said <unk> al <unk> a witness to the explosion
as soon as he left the scene everyone one hundred meters from the explosion was killed or injured al <unk> said
police recruits were waiting in line at the gates of the police college when the attack took place the interior ministry said
no group immediately claimed responsibility for the attack
<unk> the <unk> i've come to meet
the man who grabbed pushed and punched a woman he claimed to love
the one i've <unk> to help me understand
why do some men do this
how can they be stopped
dylan is <unk> league educated a self <unk> <unk> who was raised by loving parents with advanced degrees
he grew up in a beautiful home in a tony atlanta suburb
he enjoyed every <unk> a boy could want
he <unk> in places like cairo london and paris before he could even <unk>
he <unk> the <unk> image of a <unk> i have in mind
i'm <unk> of my own <unk>
lesson one
just because he had it so good doesn't mean he wasn't capable of becoming brutal
dylan has met me after work in a quiet office outside atlanta
he's asked that i change his name and hide his identity to protect him and his victim
in exchange he has agreed to take me back to a time he'd rather forget
he will map out how he became an <unk>
and how some ten years later he became a new person the man he wanted to be
going inside the mind of a <unk> i'll learn means examining much more than the images we hold onto
the story of suspended <unk> running back ray rice and other <unk> doesn't end with a knock out punch in an elevator or an attack never seen on video
nor do these <unk> begin there
<unk> parents weren't perfect
neither were friends who he <unk>
not many people are
scene one
his mother and father argued
the abuse was <unk> sometimes physical
twice he watched his father push his mother
scene two
he was sitting on a bus in the high school parking lot
he watched out the window as an <unk> he respected struck his girlfriend
hard
she was the sort of girl dylan dreamed of dating <unk>
he <unk> with others as she <unk> and <unk>
at home and at school no one talked about what dylan saw
love between a man and a woman as far as he could tell was allowed to look this way
now in his mid thirty s dylan has a tool for identifying what he witnessed and how he acted himself
have you ever seen the power and control wheel
he asks me
i have no idea what this means
he <unk> out a <unk> with a round <unk>
it shows tactics a man might use to gain <unk> in a relationship ways he may behave before <unk> to physical or sexual violence
these are the less obvious but <unk> means by which men keep women down
red flags dylan couldn't identify back then
<unk>
<unk>
male <unk>
at first the language sounds like over <unk> <unk>
but soon i realize that the wheel represents everything i'd like to <unk> my <unk> about before they go out into the world
dylan was in college when he met his first girlfriend
early on without even knowing her friends he told her he didn't like them
isolation
controlling who she sees
when she came to his room later at night than he wanted he locked the door something he never did otherwise and made her knock
he took his time answering to remind her who was boss
male <unk>
acting like the master of the castle
fast forward to after college
he was living with a new girlfriend isabelle in atlanta
she might have had the better job but he was the one who could drive
she has a <unk> and <unk> on him to get to work
he didn't let her forget it
threats
making her feel guilty
the cloud of economic abuse
she could lose her job
his boss treated him like an idiot but dylan felt he had to take it
out in the world it seemed like people walked all over him
so at home dylan <unk> power in the only place he felt he could
he was making more money by then he says and had earned the right to act like a man
more male <unk>
defining their roles
he criticized how she did her hair what she wore even the way she filled the <unk>
emotional abuse
making her feel small and <unk>
you see how this works right
he kept the wheel well <unk> and it would eventually <unk> out of control
it's one thing to hear his story but what about <unk>
once i learned he was still in touch with isabelle i told dylan i wanted to give voice to her perspective too
it seemed only fair i said
he didn't think she'd be interested in talking but he agreed to reach out to her for me
a week later isabelle and i first <unk>
she was eager to speak but only if i used a <unk>
she doesn't want her past to <unk> her present or future
growing up thousands of miles from dylan isabelle watched her father <unk> her mother
he <unk> her with his words and threw things to <unk> her
even though her mother would later find the strength to leave isabelle learned early about <unk>
today she seems self aware and certainly no <unk> as we share <unk> and <unk> in a small mexican joint
thinking back to how her relationship with dylan unfolded she says she should have seen what was coming
she'd taken to going away on <unk> to escape him
she pleaded with him to move out of her house but he wouldn't <unk>
he used her <unk> to drive against her even though she'd managed just fine before he came along
he isolated her from friends and family
too <unk> to admit how <unk> and worried she was she isolated herself further
he put her down in public and made her feel like a child
she was <unk>
after all she had a <unk> degree
she was <unk> than this
still for so long she <unk> for what they had when the relationship was good
i wanted him to come back to me as i remembered him she says
i lived for those moments when he would show up
when she changed the radio station in the car without asking he says he gave her a push and <unk> about wanting to be respected
she remembers him <unk> her against the door in the moving car and worried that if it opened she'd be a <unk>
when she once called him an <unk> he grabbed her arm
if you want to call me an <unk> i'll show you an <unk> he says
it was a sunday morning when he crossed the line for the last time
this is how dylan recalls it
she'd been up late talking on the phone with a male friend and dylan decided she was <unk>
he ripped up some of her favorite photographs
he called her a <unk> and a <unk>
he took a <unk> of flowers they were <unk> he says thinking back a decade and dumped it over her head
he threatened to break her cell phone
and then he <unk> his remaining rage with a punch to her chest
in that moment he says i realized what i'd done
he picked up the flowers and poured on the apologies
he left to give her space
he was at his parents house when the <unk> deputy drove up and served him a temporary <unk> order
dylan never fought it
that last punch was a <unk> to him too
he'd assaulted his girlfriend of more than four years on of all days father's day
i will not bring a child into this he remembers thinking
i was very clear that i needed to find a new way to move in the world because the way i was moving wasn't working and wasn't healthy
when he stood before the court he quickly agreed to stay away from her for a year
he didn't want her to have to sit on a stand and <unk> all he'd done
he says he wanted to protect her feelings
but to be honest dylan didn't want to hear it
the story she tells is less <unk> and more <unk>
isabelle says on the day of the incident she thought she'd die
she hadn't been on the phone late at night as he remembers it
no she'd escaped to a hotel to crash with visiting friends and had stayed up late with them
back home that sunday morning isabelle was <unk> <unk> from a <unk> when he grabbed her
he called me a <unk> she says and began <unk> me around the house
that <unk> of flowers he <unk> over her
he intended to break it over her head she believes but she was able to push his arm away
he tried to snap her cell phone in two and asked her which half she'd want
she tried to close a door between them which only <unk> him further
never shut the door on me
then came that punch to her chest which sent her five foot four one hundred and ten <unk> frame flying into a <unk> of laundry on the floor
the world she says fell silent
and then the universe said just play dead and so i did
he was sufficiently <unk> out and backed off long enough for her to <unk> into the bathroom and <unk> herself inside
he <unk> her with apologies through the door
he offered her <unk>
she <unk> at the <unk> of that <unk>
as if <unk> could make things better
you need to leave she says she told him
and i suggest you take an overnight bag
she's grateful there was no weapon in the house
a friend came over to help her
she called a <unk> to change the <unk> before she left the house
she wore a <unk> to hide the growing <unk>
she <unk> she was ok
but in the restaurant where the two friends went isabelle could barely <unk>
her friend took her to the hospital where the doctor said i don't know how you're alive
one <unk> to the left she was told and the direct blow to her chest could have killed her
i'm very lucky she says
i have <unk> on my <unk>
dylan promised the court he'd stay away
no contact
no phone calls
no showing up at her door
he paid <unk> covering some <unk> such as the cost of changing the <unk> in her house
he then set out to change himself
he <unk> out in the self help section of <unk> and <unk>
he armed himself with books including anger management for <unk>
when books could only take him so far he sought out more and came across men stopping violence a national training institute committed to creating safer communities for women and girls
the thirty two year old organization <unk> <unk> in churches corporations community groups government agencies and schools
the primary aim is prevention to help society understand and change the social norms that create violent men and <unk> prevent the abuse of women from even starting
only a small fraction of <unk> get <unk> explains <unk> executive director <unk> douglas
it's better to engage all men before they abuse whether they are black white rich poor young or old
if we rely only on intervention we miss the mark douglas says
prevention is what we need and this must be a <unk> approach
but there is an intervention arm of <unk> and dylan signed up for its twenty four week educational course to learn <unk> to controlling and <unk> behavior
the atlanta area course which teaches about two hundred and twenty men a year draws those who've been sent under court order and men like dylan who self <unk> <unk> because they feel they have too much to lose
maybe a wife has threatened to leave unless they get help
or protective services has required their <unk> before they can see their children again
dylan learned to let go of his definition of <unk> the image society <unk> into boys
it says tears are for <unk> <unk> is a sign of weakness
it teaches that the only <unk> emotions are anger and rage
he owned what he'd done and who he'd become
only then could he change
he found out how to be <unk> and <unk>
he became <unk> in what men stopping violence calls the <unk> of choice a path lined with speed <unk> to stop knee <unk> attacks <unk> or otherwise
he learned to take deep <unk> and think about his choices
he learned to honor his true emotions and not hide behind others
he learned to listen to his body and catch himself before acting
he learned to as he put it center myself in a spirit of patience respect peace love and empathy for what the other person is feeling
it has to be hopeful
today dylan sees himself as a better man
he went on to work in the field of social justice <unk> his time to the protection of women
and he volunteers with men stopping violence
he says he's had healthy relationships and is in one now
he calls isabelle his best friend
that gives her <unk>
she cares for him deeply sees him as a sort of brother and believes that he's grown and changed
she doesn't believe for a second that he would hurt another woman
but best friend
sometimes she feels that way
other times she struggles to go that far
i <unk> that day because i choose to forgive she says
but some of my life got stolen
she's proud of his success the career he's built but knows in some ways she paid for it
he wouldn't be doing what he's doing after all if he hadn't abused her and found his way to men stopping violence
for her the <unk> effects still <unk>
call it <unk>
if a man takes her arm <unk> she <unk>
a critical comment no matter how small can set her back to a different time
a <unk> even at a television during a football game might leave her <unk>
while he can cut out the ugly details of the past she doesn't feel she can
this old relationship still <unk> how she <unk> to men no matter all the therapy she's had
her radar is on for bad things to come and sometimes she worries that <unk> miss the signs
when a man says something nice to her she may wonder if she's being <unk>
she doesn't love as <unk>
but she also emerged on the other side <unk> in new ways
she isn't afraid to stand up for herself
she's strong enough to know she'd rather be alone than <unk>
isabelle is only willing to share her part of the journey because she wants women to see their value
she wants to give hope to those in <unk> or dangerous relationships
i want our story to encourage women to get out and men to get help she says
it has to be hopeful
otherwise i'd rather keep this <unk> in the past
she knows there are those who can't understand the friendship she's built with dylan
cutting ties though isn't easy when there's history
isabelle will be the first to admit that letting dylan into her life was a gamble
but she <unk> to see the good in him
and she knows he's unusual
he's taken responsibility
he's accountable
he is so in tune with the patterns of men that she benefits from his advice
it's like getting counseling without paying for it she says
and she's not afraid to <unk> out her own feedback to keep him in line
i found my voice she says and he learned to listen
the story of dylan and isabelle moves me
it also <unk> me
they are beyond unique
that's clear
i mean how many men who've battered really go on to build a career dedicated to protecting women
how many women who've been abused can safely <unk> their <unk>
i lose sleep <unk> if it's too good to be true
it's a friday afternoon when i <unk> in to the <unk> county <unk> for a reality check
around me are men who've recently been arrested for <unk> charges related to domestic violence
they are only here because the court made them show up at this afternoon class as a condition for bond
no one is happy to be here
some are <unk> mad
what about when you've got a woman beating on you
what if a girl likes it and puts up with it
i don't like the idea of getting locked up for something i didn't do
what if she wanted to get me in trouble and knew if she called the cops the system would be on her side
these questions are tossed at the <unk> of tactics and choices offered by men stopping violence
they have a little more than three hours to engage men shift thinking and hopefully protect women
if they're lucky some of these men will later land in their twenty four week course the type that helped dylan
i know we don't live with <unk>
i know we don't live with <unk> a teacher says
but the only person in the world i can control is myself
the conversation is <unk> toward the importance of building <unk> based on respect and equality
men are reminded that if a relationship isn't healthy for them they should get out
this talk about equality though doesn't fly with everyone
if i make more money then i have the last word
we are designed to fill certain roles in relationships
it's <unk>
why is man's role being so <unk>
in a minute we're all going to be wearing dresses
i want to learn how to be successful in a relationship without being sensitive
i want you to hear this
the world is changing warns an <unk>
begin to change your thinking <unk> your mind grow into a new possibility
during the last hour of the course as <unk> guide the men through exercises i see a few light <unk> go off but i wonder once they leave the room and return to their <unk> will the <unk> of understanding <unk>
can they like dylan give change a chance
or will they walk the path they've already traveled and abuse again
and most pressing to me how many <unk> will suffer in their <unk>
pirila puts her subjects in a dark space covering the windows while leaving a small hole for the outside light to feed in
an <unk> landscape with colors and depth preserved <unk> the room
this is the camera <unk> technique and it uses a naturally occurring phenomenon that led to the modern day camera
most cameras however have an internal <unk> that <unk> the image back to the position it appears in real life
pirila has used the technique for almost twenty years taking photos of people in finland norway italy and france
they all have a documentary basis <unk>
they show how where people live how their <unk> look and what they see from their windows pirila said
but besides this
because of the two worlds <unk> down to each other a third reality is created and made visible
that reflects perhaps mostly my mental landscape but i feel at least a bit also the landscape of the <unk> mind
before working with the technique pirila had worked with <unk> cameras which are essentially camera <unk> on a smaller scale
light and color <unk> through a small hole to create an <unk> image that is <unk> by light sensitive paper
both techniques are slow and unpredictable and <unk> one to slow down and stop amid the daily routine pirila said
moreover the actual process is crucial in both
they present a challenge to <unk> and extend conventional photography
pirila decided to explore camera <unk> after seeing black and white images by <unk> <unk> in a magazine
she couldn't find much information on this technique and she had many trials before success
pirila now has about seventy images in her project
pirila chose models she knew students friends neighbors or random <unk> though always they are people who touch me in one way or other she said
pirila sets up a room alone then <unk> the model into the space
together they find a place for the subject to pose that is comfortable for the model and <unk> <unk> for pirila
it is a big <unk> for me to show and share this light <unk> with my model she said
pirila used color film when she first started the project and has since switched to digital
film <unk> <unk> from minutes to hours and digital <unk> last anywhere from seconds to minutes she said
regardless models must hold a pose for a relatively long time for a picture to be taken in this space with low light
darkness and long <unk> create the <unk> atmosphere and let us enjoy and be inside the magic world which appears in an ordinary room for a while pirila said
light is the most important factor in photography pirila said and camera <unk> attracted her because of its play with light
i feel that the light is my home she said
that is why i am a photographer
in one thousand nine hundred and eighty four my mother was diagnosed with stage four cancer of the <unk> <unk> <unk> small <unk> <unk> and <unk>
i was eight
she was given six months to live
she refused to accept that and sought treatment in <unk> florida
her condition improved until two years later when she was diagnosed with a brain <unk>
her body was <unk> from all the <unk>
she had to wear an <unk> bag which i learned how to change because she was so weak
she had to give up her <unk> career
she had to give up the fun things in life she enjoyed doing because her body couldn't take it
she no longer had the quality of life that she <unk>
my father no longer physically attracted to her <unk> his physical needs with other women
she was too sick to give him what he physically wanted
in one thousand nine hundred and eighty eight when she was well enough to be at home full time my parents separated and filed for divorce
cancer broke their foundation of love and trust
the pain didn't stop there
in one thousand nine hundred and ninety two she was diagnosed with stage four <unk> cancer and lost her <unk>
the only part she felt that still identified her as a woman was taken away
the same year my father was diagnosed with brain cancer
he died quickly three weeks after his diagnosis
he simply collapsed and died
my right to death with dignity at twenty nine
for years she suffered
it's hard watching your mother cry over the pain
it's hard watching your mother break down piece by piece
for years she fought a pain <unk> addiction
she wanted to live so she could raise her children but in reality she spent her time in the hospitals operating rooms and <unk> offices
her hopes took a horrible turn
she suffered greatly for seventeen years until two thousand and one when doctors found cancer on her <unk>
she killed herself three days later
the person who died was not my mother
she was not the funny intelligent strong and fierce woman i knew
the person who died was sad and had lost all hope
my last memory of my mother is of this person
lying on the bed with a bottle of <unk> next to her and her eyes half open
there is no justice in her <unk> legacy
she <unk> better
she <unk> to go in a more <unk> way
dying with dignity is more than just for the person who is dying
it's for their loved ones
if it meant my mother leaving this world the way she was in one thousand nine hundred and eighty four and not in two thousand and one then i would have supported her decision to do so
my last memories of her should have been when she was still full of life on the outside even though she was dying on the inside
she chose to take her life anyway except it was without her loved ones surrounding her saying their final words and making peace
she died alone
my sister found her
her death was treated like a crime scene because she killed herself at home
there were no final words
no <unk>
nothing but the <unk> <unk> i carry with me every day because maybe i could have done something better for her
it's not fair to throw stones at someone because they are through fighting
no one person or disease is the same so it's <unk> to judge and <unk>
just because a person <unk> they are done does not make them weak or <unk>
dying with dignity is a brave decision to make
it's a decision that involves everyone and it's one of the greatest gifts of love that person can give to those left behind
when assisted suicide is not the answer
some say she beat cancer
she was given six months to live but lived for seventeen years
but what kind of life was it
was it a life worth living
she had so much to live for but at what cost
what kind of life was it for her children
i can tell you it was hard
i was <unk> of a childhood
it was years of struggles and tears
i would never wish what i had lived through on anyone
no child should have to see their parents suffer so much
today i'm <unk> married and have a four year old son
i would never want him to watch either one of his parents suffer
if a diagnosis is final and the options are there i just may choose to die with dignity and end my life on my terms
if you have to explain death how hard is it to include dying before the suffering becomes too great
sure the experiences built me up to be strong and be able to handle some serious stress and in part made me the person i am today but i would <unk> trade it back if my mother could have done things her way when she really should have
being a mother having a six year old daughter how do i explain it to her
no this is not us
said the muslim from virginia
the immigration <unk> powerful video message hit on the emotions some muslims around the world were feeling
outrage <unk> and shame
i am just <unk> said the thirty one year old
i don't know why we feel that it's ok to kill innocent people in the name of protecting something that does not need or require protection
i am really sorry to the whole world as a muslim that we have some ignorant people that have taken some very ignorant actions in the name of faith
to be clear <unk> and other muslims who spoke to cnn were not <unk> for their beliefs some are <unk> to the world on behalf of their religion <unk> by the few muslims extremists who attacked french satirical magazine charlie hebdo this week
of the twelve people who died four were cartoonists and one was a muslim police officer on the scene
<unk> <unk> a self described <unk> converted to islam two months after september eleven
the new <unk> resident wears a <unk> and says she has felt more <unk> than normal after the paris terror attack
i fear the attack will mean that people will be more likely to <unk> at me to call me names in public or even attack me she said
but i hope that it means that people will ask me questions about my faith and that i can make it clear that these attacks have no place in islam
perception is also playing into ahmad <unk> <unk> mind
the twenty year old student from istanbul turkey is no longer thinking of studying abroad in france
the attack made him suspect that some french might look upon muslims differently after wednesday's attack
meanwhile <unk> <unk> <unk> an american living in <unk> oman was initially angry at the <unk> of her religion
but she became <unk> when she realized she would have to <unk> the people around her that this is not islam
i want to <unk> my intense alarm and <unk> at the deaths of the charlie hebdo staff members
but i will not apologize for my beliefs or my religion she said
<unk> sees this time as an opportunity to educate people

the migrants were being sent to reception facilities
authorities responded late thursday to a distress call from the ezadeen italy's coast guard said
it's the second rescue of a <unk> vessel off italy's coast in what appears to be a worrying new <unk> by people traffickers who either <unk> the ship or mix with the passengers
overnight the ezadeen was at a <unk> fifty eight miles off the city of <unk> in the <unk> sea the coast guard said where rescuers were trying to <unk> the <unk> engines
the <unk> coast guard said its vessel <unk> <unk> the stranded ship to shore
the <unk> was unable to <unk> at a <unk> port because of the ship's limited <unk> the coast guard said
the <unk> was doing surveillance for frontex the european union border management agency when it was called in to help
six italian and four <unk> coast guard crew members boarded the <unk> the italian coast guard said
as well as taking control of the ship they brought food and water for its passengers
un
three thousand died in two thousand and fourteen trying to get to europe
the italian air force and coast guard said that weather conditions had made the rescue operation very challenging with coast guard crew members having to be taken by helicopter to the ship which is flying the flag of sierra leone
the alarm was raised when migrants launched an <unk> said <unk> <unk> a spokeswoman for the italian coast guard
since last september she told cnn there have been fifteen similar cargo ships carrying mainly migrants from syria who are <unk> and can pay more than others who are forced to travel on smaller <unk> boats
she cited the international organization for migration as saying the price for each passenger was about six thousand euros with a reduction if there are more than two hundred and fifty passengers on board
such cargo ships leave from a greek or turkish port with the migrants already on board she said
they are old merchant ships that should not be <unk> in the mediterranean sea she said and still have a flag as in the case of the ezadeen or carry a fake flag
they sail in turkish or greek waters without <unk> suspicion and appear to be normal merchant ships <unk> said
however once in italian save and rescue operational waters they launch a mayday via satellite phone to a humanitarian association or directly to the italian coast guard she said

it's a <unk> dollar business for those operating such ships she said
<unk> estimates that each passenger paid three thousand dollar to travel on the ezadeen
while their work is focused on border control frontex vessels provided by eu member states are <unk> to help in search and rescue situations <unk> said

it has now <unk> back the project which cost <unk> nine million euros a month from november two thousand and thirteen to the end of two thousand and fourteen
in october the european union announced that frontex would launch its own operation dubbed <unk> in the central mediterranean to help fill the gap
eu commissioner <unk> <unk> said the new frontex operation would show concrete solidarity to italy by <unk> its border surveillance and supporting its humanitarian efforts
but she said it is clear that the <unk> operation can not and will not replace mare nostrum
while operation mare nostrum is over in name italian <unk> assets are still carrying out <unk> in cooperation with frontex vessels which call them in to help
the san <unk> a navy ship that was converted to rescue migrants under mare nostrum and which was the primary rescue vehicle is still active in such missions and was used last week to rescue those on board the burning greek ferry norman atlantic
it is equipped with an <unk> jail cells for smugglers <unk> sections for potential ebola patients and sleeping quarters for the migrants

there were way too many people stuck down there without a clear entrance or exit
people got stuck and <unk>
a lot of police gathered in that central area but more police could have <unk> the consequences he said
when someone fell down people behind would think the crowd is moving so more people were moving forward and falling
he blamed what happened on <unk> people's lack of awareness of how to protect themselves and on heavy traffic that blocked ambulances from getting to the scene sooner

chinese president xi jinping requested an immediate investigation into what happened and said a profound lesson should be learned from the events xinhua reported thursday
zuo <unk> out what he learned from the terrible end to two thousand and fourteen
don't attend big <unk> like that ever again
kim jong un is not officially on speaking terms with south korean president park <unk> <unk>
but on thursday in his new year's address he said that could change
last week north korea's government news agency branded park's election as <unk> and her father himself a former president a dictator
but in his televised speech for the first time ever the communist leader said he'd talk with park south korean news agency yonhap reported
depending on the mood and circumstances to be created we have no reason not to hold the highest level talks kim said
north korea's state news agency did not publish those remarks in the official transcript of kim's speech
his words may represent a small <unk> <unk> but that doesn't mean things will keep moving yonhap cautioned
still kim spoke in detail about the need to improve north south relations
in between <unk> <unk> particularly against the <unk> military partnership with the united states there have been <unk> <unk>
three months ago some of the <unk> highest officials paid a snap friendly visit to the south that sparked excited live television coverage
and this past monday <unk> <unk> minister <unk> <unk> <unk> sent a <unk> to pyongyang suggesting cabinet ministers on both sides to meet in january yonhap reported
the south and the north will have to meet each other and discuss ways toward peaceful reunification <unk> later told journalists
reunification is what both sides are pushing for
we should make fresh <unk> in the national reunification movement for this year kim said in thursday's address according to the official transcript published by the <unk> korean central news agency
but they have pursued it on <unk> different terms
president park last year announced a two thousand and fifteen road map to reunification which she laid out in a speech in april in dresden germany yonhap has reported
dresden was part of east germany back when germany was divided between the democratic west and soviet communist east and south koreans have drawn hope from that country's reunification for the possible <unk> of their own
park's talk has been called the dresden declaration
since then the south has sought support from its international allies for park's reunification plan selling a single korea as an economic <unk> to a global free market yonhap has reported
the north has <unk> against this <unk> the economically <unk> south <unk> by other <unk> countries would in a reunification effectively <unk> the north
kim does not want <unk> allies involved and criticized the <unk> diplomatic efforts again on thursday
to go on a tour around foreign countries <unk> for international cooperation in <unk> the <unk> korean relations issue the one related with our nation is a <unk> <unk> of leaving its <unk> in the hands of outside forces he said
but kim's conciliatory words following after the <unk> offer to talk again and his <unk> of moving talks up to the highest level could be significant
<unk> who extended that invitation is also park's right hand in her reunification effort yonhap reported
he said his offer to talk was in line with the two thousand and fifteen road map
but kim's speech was not all conciliatory
some of it was <unk>
he <unk> his forces <unk> with the <unk> possibly a reference to <unk> reactions to south korean u.s. military exercises
the dictator also praised political killings in his own ranks
our party detected and <unk> the anti party <unk> <unk> at an <unk> time and with a correct decision the <unk> speech transcript said
south korean intelligence officials said that members of the <unk> ruling party were shot by firing squad for viewing a south korean soap opera
and there are additional pressure points that have <unk> seoul pyongyang <unk> in the past such as the floating of messages via <unk> by activists in the south into the north
north korean soldiers opening fire on these balloons last year struck south korean territory
there were no reported injuries or damage
the north sees the balloons as a violation of its borders
the south sees them as an exercise of free speech
the south imposed an economic sanctions package on the north in two thousand and ten over the attack on a south korean navy ship that killed forty six <unk>
seoul demands that pyongyang take responsibility for <unk> the vessel before it <unk> the sanctions
the sound of gunfire marked new year's eve in the tense disputed region of <unk> between india and pakistan
pakistani rangers shot and killed an indian soldier india's military said
india's military shot and killed two pakistani rangers pakistan's military said
both sides claimed that the other started the <unk>
indian military spokesman <unk> <unk> said pakistani rangers opened fire <unk> at indian positions in the <unk> sector of indian <unk> <unk> as the old year was coming to a close
a second indian border soldier was wounded in the fight he said
pakistan's <unk> rangers said that their indian counterparts had a meeting and when two rangers contacted them the indian side opened fire
the two were wounded and later died they said
the two nuclear armed south asian neighbors had agreed to a bilateral ceasefire in border regions in november two thousand and three and the agreement held for years
but there have been <unk> in recent years
<unk> has been in the <unk> of separatist violence since one thousand nine hundred and eighty nine which has claimed over forty three thousand lives
indian soldiers killed in <unk> with militants in <unk>
searchers looking for more bodies and wreckage from airasia flight qz eight thousand five hundred and one continue to be hindered by tough weather conditions
ships planes and helicopters are being used to try to find victims of the disaster
most of the people on board the flight remain missing and search teams are still looking for the main wreckage of the plane
efforts are being <unk> in a zone covering one thousand five hundred and seventy five square nautical miles that officials believe is the most probable area to find the remains of the aircraft
but on friday waves in the java sea as high as four meters were making it hard for divers search underwater
the weather is the biggest <unk> said bambang <unk> chief of police in indonesia's central <unk> province where much of the search operation is based
here's more key information about where things stand on flight qz eight thousand five hundred and one
what we know
the aircraft took off early sunday from surabaya indonesia bound for singapore
roughly thirty five minutes into the flight the pilot asked air traffic control for permission to turn left and climb to a higher altitude to avoid bad weather
minutes later the plane disappeared from air traffic <unk> radar
what we don't know
what happened on board after contact with the plane was lost
no distress call was received
indonesian aviation authorities have suggested that the plane ascended despite permission being denied because of traffic
some experts have <unk> that the aircraft might have experienced an <unk> stall because of a lack of speed or from flying at too sharp an angle to get enough lift
analysts have also suggested that the pilots might not have been getting information from onboard systems about the plane's position or that rain or <unk> from thunderstorms in the area could have damaged the engines
until the main wreckage of the plane is found along with the flight recorders experts have little evidence to support their theories
what we know
search teams found debris and some bodies in the water tuesday one hundred to two hundred kilometers from the aircraft's last known location over the java sea indonesia's search and rescue agency said
thirty bodies have so far been recovered from the sea indonesian officials said friday
early friday what appears to be a piece of the fuselage was found singapore's defense ministry said
it <unk> a window panel
the uss <unk> the u.s. navy ship that is helping with the search recovered two bodies thursday the u.s
seventh fleet said friday
indonesia is leading the international search effort with assistance from a range of countries including malaysia singapore and the united states
what we don't know
the exact location of the body of the aircraft
an indonesian search official told cnn on wednesday that he thought sonar equipment had detected wreckage from flight eight thousand five hundred and one at the bottom of the java sea
but the country's search and rescue chief said the plane hadn't been found yet
bad weather has hindered the search operation
the ones who missed the flight
what we know
the plane was carrying one hundred and fifty five passengers and seven crew members
the overwhelming majority of those on board were <unk>
there were also citizens of britain france malaysia singapore and south korea
details are emerging about some of the people on the flight recounted by family members and friends
what we don't know
when the missing passengers and crew members will be recovered
indonesian authorities have identified four of the recovered bodies so far
the first victim they identified an indonesian woman named <unk> <unk> <unk> was buried thursday
many family members are waiting in surabaya for news about their loved ones
what we know
the key to understanding what happened may be in the aircraft's cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder <unk> known as black boxes
the black boxes which are actually orange are in the tail of airbus three hundred and twenty two hundred s. if recovered they will be taken to a lab in jakarta indonesia to be <unk> said <unk> <unk> head of indonesia's national committee for transportation safety
the batteries <unk> the <unk> that send <unk> signals have only about twenty five days of power left he said
what we don't know
where the plane's remains might have been taken by the elements
investigators will need to use information <unk> from the flight recorders and clues from the wreckage
the more <unk> i can put into my <unk> the better my picture will be aviation safety expert michael <unk> said
the better the picture the better i can come up with an understanding of what happened
but the conditions at sea make that work much more difficult than on land
in the water you are working with currents and winds and so the pieces won't be where they had the initial impact he said
what happens next
the plane and the pilots
what we know
the six year old airbus a three hundred and twenty two hundred operated by <unk> indonesian affiliate had <unk> around twenty three thousand flight hours in about thirteen thousand six hundred flights according to airbus
the plane's last scheduled maintenance was on november sixteen
flight eight thousand five hundred and one's veteran captain <unk> fifty three had twenty thousand five hundred and thirty seven flying hours six thousand one hundred of them with airasia on the airbus a three hundred and twenty the airline said
the first officer <unk> <unk> <unk> forty six had two thousand two hundred and seventy five flying hours a reasonable amount for his position
what we don't know
whether technical problems human error or other issues were involved in the crash
according to information from the aviation safety network accident database there have been fifty four incidents involving the a three hundred and twenty
in the a three hundred and twenty family accidents and incidents range from fan <unk> <unk> landing gear collapse bird strikes right through to <unk> losses through pilot error said <unk> ray an analyst with the international bureau of aviation a global aviation consulting group
most aircraft have <unk> problems and in most cases these are <unk>
very rarely these issues cause disasters largely because of a <unk> of factors that lead to the event ray said
peter greste mohamed <unk> <unk> and <unk> mohamed were convicted in june of supporting the banned muslim brotherhood
greste and <unk> were sentenced to seven years in prison and mohamed to ten years
the muslim brotherhood a religious and political group was banned in egypt and <unk> a terrorist organization after president mohamed <unk> <unk> in two thousand and thirteen
he was egypt's first <unk> elected leader after the arab spring uprising
tv cameras were not allowed in thursday's hearing in the court of <unk> and the <unk> journalists were also <unk> from the <unk>
the men's families were disappointed at the outcome
they had hoped the court would throw out the case and release them or at least free them on bail pending retrial but they remain behind bars
the retrial date has not yet been set
this was not good as we hoped for <unk> greste mother of australian journalist peter greste told reporters at the court
i believe in his innocence
lawyers for the three defendants asked the court for their release but told reporters that the chances were <unk>
<unk> lawyers asked for his <unk> to canada he is egyptian canadian taking advantage of a new law allowing a president to <unk> defendants
the judge <unk> the retrial will decide on their release said <unk> el <unk> a lawyer for peter greste and mohamed
<unk> brothers mike and andrew greste expressed mixed feelings about the court's decision
it's a step in the right direction
obviously it's a little <unk> that we didn't get the most positive outcome but on reflection it's certainly the next best result for us mike greste told cnn affiliate seven network australia
but <unk> family hopes egypt's government will make use of other legal <unk> to free his brother peter sooner
following <unk> from peter and the family <unk> egyptian lawyer <unk> an application with the egyptian attorney <unk> office to have peter <unk> <unk> to a presidential <unk> that was issued in november andrew greste said
we believe there is now a window of opportunity for the egyptian president to exercise his presidential power under the <unk> he greste said
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> said they planned to <unk> despite his <unk>
we will hold our wedding <unk> inside the prison she said
i believe it's a message to the whole world that mohamed is innocent and i believe in his innocence
and it is a personal message to him that i love him and i know that he is innocent
<unk> brother <unk> <unk> said the whole family had shared in the <unk> ordeal
it's the <unk> of injustice what happened he said
he lost a year and more now of his life
we are suffering as a family severely for my brother as all the families are for their loved ones
and i can't describe in words what we've been through this year
in a statement issued after the ruling al <unk> urged egyptian authorities to move <unk> to a retrial
lawyers point out that the appeal process from this point could take another twelve to eighteen months the broadcaster said
<unk> peter and mohamed have been <unk> in jail for over a year now an al <unk> spokesman said
the egyptian authorities have a simple choice free these men quickly or continue to string this out all the while continuing this injustice and <unk> the image of their own country in the eyes of the world
they should choose the former
there has been wide international condemnation of egypt's prosecution of the three journalists who deny wrongdoing
the united states australia and european union have all called for the men to be freed as have rights groups including amnesty international the committee to protect journalists and the international press institute
the appeal was accepted because of <unk> <unk> in the trial that led to the conviction
the men had appeared in a special court created to handle terrorism cases which may in <unk> be considered illegal
prosecutors are now expected to present the same case in a new court
the three journalists have been imprisoned in cairo since december two thousand and thirteen on charges that included conspiring with the muslim brotherhood <unk> false news and <unk> national security
they have steadfastly denied the charges as has al <unk> and the prosecution put forward no evidence to support the allegations
prosecutors were criticized for <unk> evidence that was purportedly made up or <unk> to the case like videos of <unk> old news reports from other countries
amnesty international has said that greste <unk> and mohamed are <unk> in a geopolitical dispute between egypt and qatar the tiny but oil rich middle eastern country that <unk> al <unk>
qatar has long been perceived as a supporter of the muslim brotherhood which was declared a terrorist organization just days before the al <unk> journalists were arrested at the cairo hotel where they were working
with saudi <unk> however there has been a recent improvement in egyptian qatari relations
president <unk> <unk> el <unk> met with a qatari envoy in december and the meeting was followed by al <unk> decision to <unk> its egyptian <unk> <unk> channel
this channel is already banned by an egyptian court and was at the center of the journalists trial even though they work for the <unk> english language channel
<unk> <unk> <unk> welcomed the apparent improvement in the two countries relations
i hope the reconciliation between egypt and qatar can lead to a better outcome she said
it's very hard for us to feel that they will stay for a year in prison
it's very tough
they did nothing
but thanks to authorities a ship on course to crash against the <unk> italian coast was stopped in time saving passengers and <unk> a possible environmental catastrophe
italian coast guard commander <unk> <unk> said the vessel was cruising on <unk> toward the coast at six nautical miles per hour
when it entered italian search and rescue waters the coast guard sent helicopters with six men who boarded the ship and took control
the course of the vessel was <unk> to avoid a <unk> with the rocks and it was <unk> instead to <unk> in italy's southern <unk> region
it <unk> safely there wednesday
the <unk> carried seven hundred and ninety six migrants the coast guard said thursday most believed to be from war torn syria
authorities on wednesday put the number of migrants on board at seven hundred and sixty eight
the crew of the blue sky m apparently jumped ship
the coast guard said a <unk> would not only have led to the deaths of passengers but would also have created an environmental disaster
it said a real disaster was avoided
the <unk> sent a distress signal near the greek island of <unk> on tuesday <unk> italian and greek authorities to the situation on board
the greek merchant marine ministry and the greek navy have said the pilot of a greek helicopter that flew over the cargo ship spoke with the captain who said the ship was not in distress and did not need assistance
<unk> <unk> a spokeswoman for the italian coast guard in rome said there were no deaths related to the blue sky m incident
she added that about one hundred people have been hospitalized mainly because of the cold and <unk>
it was not immediately clear where the migrants will go
the authorities will investigate what happened to the crew and how the <unk> reached italy's waters
but let's start with the bad news
isis is not going away
no one is <unk> a swift defeat of isis the self proclaimed islamic state which has proved resilient in the six months since its sudden <unk> through iraq to the <unk> of baghdad
the easy <unk> are fewer the challenge of governing <unk> air strikes debilitating
and a new iraqi prime minister <unk> al abadi has begun to <unk> bridges with the country's sunni minority and <unk> the army
but isis is still as much on the offensive as the <unk>
it appears to accept the <unk> and flow of conflict <unk> between holding territory and classic terror tactics
it is constantly seeking ways to stretch iraqi forces which are still very much a work in slow progress
perhaps isis best hope in iraq in coming months is that <unk> north of baghdad will turn to it if shia dominated militia <unk> them
isis greatest <unk> will be the expensive and labor intensive job of governing
providing social services power and water ensuring food supplies
there are already plenty of signs in iraq's second city mosul especially that isis is failing on most of these counts
at some point in two thousand and fifteen iraqi security forces will look to retake mosul but predictions of a new year offensive seem optimistic
in syria there are signs that isis is looking to open up new fronts south of damascus and toward the lebanese border either itself or by co <unk> other factions
it holds territory north of aleppo ready to take advantage of other rebel groups being <unk> by the assad regime
the syrian battlefield is very complicated with <unk> coming and going in a country of dozens of factions that spend as much time fighting each other as they do bashar assad
military victory for the government or its opponents is as unlikely in two thousand and fifteen as it was in two thousand and fourteen or two thousand and thirteen
<unk> <unk> a longtime syria <unk> at the university of <unk> says the somalia <unk> of the country is inevitable so long as the international community <unk> all centers of power in syria and the opposition <unk> to <unk>
only a political settlement will end the bloodshed as was the case in lebanon and <unk> in decades past
but that too appears remote despite russia taking on the <unk> of <unk>
the strongest factions include isis and the al qaeda affiliate al nusra while moderate groups <unk> by the international community have lost ground
even so waging war for three years has taken its toll on the regime
<unk> <unk> in syria comment expects the <unk> <unk> base
<unk> infrastructure and perhaps <unk> to become a critical factor in the coming year noting its difficulty in <unk> enough capable troops
and the <unk> main allies iran and russia are among the countries hit by lower oil prices
the three million syrians who have become refugees face another year in tents and shelters with two thirds of the children receiving little or no schooling according to unicef
iraqi foreign minister ibrahim al <unk> recently compared the rise of isis with the thirty years war that <unk> apart much of europe in the seventeen th century
it's difficult to argue with him as fifty <unk> of <unk> spread across the arab world from <unk> in libya to sanaa in yemen
four of the region's largest countries are in the <unk> of civil war
the situation in libya has <unk> throughout two thousand and <unk> now a chaotic mix of tribal and jihadist groups fight for territory and oil while a parliament <unk> from tripoli stands powerless on the <unk>
oil production is less than a quarter of the level four years ago
expect the situation in libya to get still worse in two thousand and fifteen with the absence of state authority also encouraging bigger <unk> of illegal migrants from sub <unk> africa to the mediterranean
<unk> chaos is likely to <unk> over <unk> weak neighbors like niger and the presence of jihadist camps in the desert may invite egyptian military action
u.s. president barack obama recognized the long term problems in the arab world and america's limited ability to <unk> in his year end national public radio interview
when it comes to what is going to be a <unk> project in a place like libya or a place like syria or a place like iraq we can help but we can't do it for them he said
obama made it clear that in the last twenty four months of his presidency that he would not be rushed into nation <unk> in the middle east or anywhere else saying the <unk> in washington think you can just move <unk> pieces around the table
and <unk> we have that kind of <unk> we tend to get burned
obama also spoke of strategic patience which is very much on show in <unk> <unk> reaching out to tehran
a common enemy isis has led to a <unk> understanding between the united states and iran
whether that opens the window to a broader relationship and whether negotiations on iran's nuclear program will succeed is one of the big questions of two thousand and fifteen
<unk> for agreement on <unk> iran's nuclear program have come and gone
the next is july
the obama administration has invested heavily in seeking a deal since president hassan <unk> election in two thousand and thirteen and <unk> is keen to show the iranian people he can end their economic and political isolation
obama in his year end interview with <unk> said he believed there are elements inside of iran that recognize the opportunity and want to take it
<unk> in iran may see such an opening as <unk> their influence and opening the door to all sorts of western <unk>
the momentum appears to be <unk> against them but the <unk> between tehran and the international community remain <unk>
perhaps the best to be expected is an <unk> deal that further <unk> sanctions
it seemed like happy christmas
war is over in kabul as the international security assistance force this week <unk> the flag and ended combat missions
the taliban marked the ceremony by mocking the west for <unk> billions of dollars and hundreds of lives
training and assistance to the afghan military will continue with some thirteen thousand troops most of them american staying on under operation <unk> support
some will conduct anti terrorism operations but are unlikely to be enough to <unk> off the <unk> <unk> in southern provinces
we will also find out whether <unk> <unk> successor as afghan president <unk> <unk> can improve the regional <unk>
<unk> one of the worst <unk> of two thousand and fourteen the pakistan taliban attack on a school in peshawar may help him
for years pakistan and afghanistan have traded accusations alleging the other supports terrorist groups
while the afghan taliban use pakistani soil as a rear base so the pakistani taliban slip into afghanistan to avoid the military and to <unk>
cnn's <unk> robertson on the horror of pakistan school massacre
the day after the school <unk> a senior pakistani military official flew to kabul to meet <unk>
pakistan clearly wants action against the <unk> of the attack at least one of whom was purportedly in afghanistan
<unk> will want a <unk> pro quo which pakistan may be <unk> to provide
it has always seen the afghan taliban and associated groups like the <unk> network as a tool against indian influence in afghanistan
but the two governments already are stepping up border cooperation
it's rare that one event changes the direction of a region but there does appear to be a rare window of opportunity for a more <unk> campaign against terrorism
the history of the region suggests it may not stay open long
and the <unk> territory of the region <unk> the insurgents
by most <unk> the world will be heavily <unk> on the united states and china to drive growth this year
<unk> <unk> <unk> u.s. growth of three percents and china's at seven percents while much of europe <unk> into positive territory
the numbers may be improved by the suddenly lower price of oil
the international monetary fund says the sharp fall in the price of crude should add nearly one percents to global growth
many analysts expect the price to recover slightly but only a catastrophe on the production side would see the price back above one hundred dollar a barrel
for europe the united states and china a lower oil price is good news
it's essentially a tax cut for consumers
the economist estimates that the average u.s. <unk> could save eight hundred dollar
but economies heavily <unk> on oil revenues nigeria russia and <unk> for example will suffer
so may heavily <unk> oil companies
for every one dollar drop in the price of crude <unk> is estimated to lose some seven hundred million dollar in revenue making it difficult to service debt and fund basic imports
<unk> global demand and the rise in u.s. <unk> oil production are two reasons for the fall in crude prices
saudi arabia's decision not to cut its production is another
some oil analysts believe the saudis are trying to <unk> their market share and make <unk> sources such as <unk> less viable
look out for <unk> among smaller <unk> <unk>
but for russia another problem
one of the safest predictions for two thousand and fifteen is that russians will have a tough year
besides the <unk> oil price high interest rates to defend a vulnerable <unk> a <unk> economy and financial sanctions are a toxic combination
the <unk> question is how president vladimir putin will respond
will he double down seeking closer ties with china india and the rest of asia and causing <unk> in the <unk>
or will the kremlin see the <unk> of ukraine as not worth the <unk>
jeffrey <unk> in foreign policy asks whether <unk> to <unk> his people from ever <unk> economic straits putin could <unk> separatist sentiment in say the majority russian <unk> town of <unk>
putin certainly sees an historic struggle under way
he told the <unk> in december that the policy of <unk> by western powers was not <unk> yesterday
it has been carried out against our country for many years always for decades if not centuries
to moscow ukraine's bid for nato <unk> is the latest <unk> of that policy
but russia's and ukraine's weakness may also provide <unk> for a deal
ukraine <unk> few of the conditions for nato <unk> and is unlikely to for years
what if obama and german chancellor angela merkel <unk> <unk> that the alliance will keep ukraine at <unk> length and <unk> <unk> sanctions in return for an end to the russian sponsored rebellion in eastern ukraine
but until this frozen conflict finds a solution russian companies will suffer unable to tap into international credit markets and more than ever <unk> on <unk> to the kremlin
and russian citizens standard of living will be hurt by inflation and <unk> interest rates
cheaper oil just may help europe <unk> another <unk>
but the european central bank is not taking any chances
it's planning to take a page from the <unk> of the u.s. federal reserve through a massive program of <unk> <unk> to buy <unk> <unk> and shock the european economy into life
most in need of the <unk>
france and italy
if <unk> president mario <unk> and oil can't <unk> europe back into growth the popular mood will continue to <unk> benefiting parties like the anti immigration anti europe <unk> in britain and protest party <unk> in spain
the british vote is in may and few <unk> to predict the outcome
but it seems very likely that one or more of the smaller parties will be involved in coalition negotiations and the historic decline in the vote of the <unk> and conservative parties will continue
that same <unk> has occurred in greece where snap elections could bring the radical anti eu syriza to power <unk> the complex rescue that kept greece inside the <unk>
<unk> <unk> of the <unk> group says a syriza government in greece part of a wider shift toward <unk> in europe will have the potential to generate <unk> to france and italy where unemployment is high and <unk> governments <unk>
across europe the political establishment is under siege from this <unk> which on the left wants vast programs of public works and an end to austerity and on the right a hard line against immigration and european integration
in germany nearly twenty thousand people marched through dresden in december under the banner patriotic europeans against the islamization of the west
from finland to <unk> elections in two thousand and fifteen will be worth watching
a historic transition in under way in china
the <unk> from an economy based on being the <unk> of the world into one more sustained by domestic demand
the chinese leadership is walking a fine line between growth and <unk> <unk> reforms that include a crackdown on <unk> corruption and <unk> what's known as <unk> banking <unk> and <unk> <unk> lending estimated to be worth nearly five dollar trillion
the coming year will be a critical stage in that transition
one low <unk> conflict that will endure in two thousand and fifteen is beijing's determination to <unk> the map of the south china sea of which it claims eighty percents
this <unk> <unk> is driven by the promise of oil and gas and the importance of the region's shipping <unk>
new chinese passports show the nine <unk> line <unk> a century ago and <unk> the <unk> waters of vietnam malaysia indonesia and the philippines
there have already been <unk> over some remote pacific <unk>
other governments are <unk> up to challenge china in international <unk>
more <unk> seem likely in the coming year and the u.s. is being drawn into the dispute after recently <unk> the nine <unk> line
another testing ground for the world's two largest economies will be trade
the recent u.s. china agreement to reduce <unk> on information technology goods is a hopeful sign but edward <unk> at the council for foreign relations notes that big developing countries like china india and brazil have <unk> into global players in their own right making it harder to reach deals than it was when the united states and europe called most of the shots
a <unk> of international meetings in two thousand and fifteen will be critical for the way the world manages trade
the <unk> pacific partnership between the u.s. and asian countries the <unk> trade and investment partnership and world trade organization talks
none will be easy but republican control may actually help the obama administration get fast track congressional approval for any <unk>
critical to the fate of the doha round of <unk> talks will be the attitude of india a country where <unk> interests have long opposed <unk> in trade and services
narendra modi's <unk> party came to power on a pro business platform and its bilateral agreement with the united states in two thousand and fourteen on food security <unk> the way for progress on the doha round
it's also important for the <unk> future
if the doha round <unk> trade may become more about bilateral and <unk> deals
the history of trade negotiations is that they always take longer than <unk> so we may have to <unk> the topic a year from now
now <unk> the word climate for trade in that last sentence and double it
the world has been waiting for meaningful progress on talks to <unk> carbon emissions since the <unk> summit five years ago
in the meantime the earth keeps getting <unk> in two thousand and fourteen it was one degree fahrenheit warmer than the one thousand nine hundred and sixty one one thousand nine hundred and ninety average
a lot is riding on the paris conference to be held in december
in the wake of the <unk> meeting in lima <unk> in november it seems ambitions have been <unk> to the lowest common <unk>
a final deal will be based on national plans to be submitted by individual governments by april one
lima also produced a <unk> on the issue of how developing nations would contribute to overall goals
few environmental groups are optimistic that anything meaningful and <unk> will emerge in paris and the fund to help emerging nations adapt their infrastructure is worth a <unk> of the one hundred billion dollar target
in the last few weeks a little vehicle called curiosity was <unk> across a <unk> on mars when it picked up wild <unk> in methane levels
why would this be exciting
on earth most methane is produced <unk>
some of it is millions of years old found deep underground
if the same were true of mars it would indicate some form of <unk> life on the planet
much more needs to be done to identify the origin of the methane
but michael <unk> a senior scientist at nasa's <unk> space flight center told scientific american the discovery was very exciting because it very clearly shows methane has a source on the planet
maybe in two thousand and fifteen curiosity will come across another <unk> in methane and can gather <unk> air samples which would help researchers identify the source of the methane
the presence of carbon twelve the scientists say would be cause for real excitement as it would indicate a biological origin
it's a <unk> <unk> of a complex and powerful phenomenon that is about to land on us a massive surge in the data showing what we do when and where
none of this happens in a calendar year of course but by two thousand and twenty according to it industry analysts <unk> there will be twenty six billion connected devices <unk> and <unk> data assisted by the explosion in <unk> technology such as smart glasses and <unk>
so businesses will invest heavily in two thousand and fifteen in data <unk> analysis and <unk>
knowing how to <unk> the data what to keep and what to <unk> what to hold locally and what to store in the cloud will all be critical to smart use of this <unk> amount of information
<unk> <unk> of <unk> expects businesses to make use of big data services in the cloud and we expect machine learning to grow <unk> across the <unk> manufacturing and health care sectors
deep learning will be a big part of this process <unk> computers are designed to behave more like the human brain thanks to deep <unk> networks <unk> them to learn through observation
we are getting close to the point where machines will make better decisions than us
as anthony wing <unk> <unk> in forbes
this will not be the year that eighty percents of the developed world loses their jobs to intelligent machines but it is not too soon to start <unk> out what to do about that <unk>
maybe one of them will be writing this column next year
the governing body of world football fifa has spent the last year <unk> in crisis over the way russia and especially qatar were chosen to host the next two world cups

the popular twenty one day annapurna circuit takes <unk> in a <unk> shaped route around a majestic segment of the himalayas in nepal
on the ten th day of the tour chaudhary and his clients two young israeli women were <unk> from the highest point of the trail <unk> la pass to the next destination a walk that would normally take about seven hours
now after more than ten hours of heading downhill the snow <unk>
the <unk> fell heavier and faster <unk> their vision
there was nowhere to stop or rest
they had to keep walking
you couldn't see the trail there was snow everywhere making it easy to get lost said chaudhary
it was all white in the distance you could only see <unk> of people walking
some <unk> off the trail
as the <unk> continued their feet <unk> into the snow pile
as their steps became heavier they began to cry
as the hours passed chaudhary could make out <unk> and supplies <unk> on the snow
there were people who had fallen or were stuck or resting along the way
i couldn't tell if i saw a dead body
conditions in the himalayas can be cruel
but <unk> dying in <unk> on the annapurna circuit is almost <unk> of until this year
nepal known for its <unk> himalayas including mount everest has endured a deadly tragic year
in april a hanging <unk> mass collapsed and <unk> through a dangerous route on everest killing sixteen <unk> in the worst single disaster
months later an <unk> <unk> struck annapurna killing at least forty three people including locals and foreign tourists
were the disasters just prone to happen or was climate change a factor
everest <unk> have spoken of changes they've witnessed for years
in my first journey there was snow and ice said <unk> <unk> a retired <unk> who made his first summit in one thousand nine hundred and ninety
now we can see more rock
it's more dangerous
the <unk> <unk> the ice is falling there's rocks falling more
after a record twenty one <unk> of everest he has no doubt that conditions are changing rapidly
<unk> stephen <unk> who has been climbing everest since two thousand and six agreed
our <unk> show that <unk> are <unk> off the mountains much <unk> and we're seeing <unk> much more frequently and of greater magnitude
whether the deadly disasters in nepal this year can be linked to climate change is <unk>
i am <unk> of <unk> everything bad in nature to climate change said jeffrey <unk> senior associate research scientist at the university of arizona who studies the himalayas
<unk> out what's specifically due to climate change and what's not is a difficult and sometimes impossible task
that said it's clear climate is changing all over the world including in nepal
while it's difficult to blame any single incident on climate change there's evidence of an increasingly warming himalayas
temperatures in the central himalayas increased by about zero point six degrees celsius per decade between one thousand nine hundred and seventy seven and two thousand according to one study
in the <unk> <unk> the average temperature in <unk> rose by one point three five degrees celsius in thirty years according to a report by international centre for integrated mountain development
the impact of climate change includes <unk> <unk> melt <unk> rainfall changes in the <unk> season and greater risk of <unk> such as <unk> landslides and floods
natural disasters always happen regardless of climate change experts say
what's <unk> is that disasters in the himalayas are becoming more common
extreme flooding hit pakistan in two thousand and twelve and landslides and flooding washed away streets and killed hundreds in two thousand and thirteen at a <unk> holy site in <unk> india
<unk> early and heavy <unk> rains triggered that disaster in which two months of rain poured in two days
these extreme rare events they're not rare anymore <unk> said
the himalayas stretch from the eastern corner of afghanistan through nepal to the northern tip of myanmar
they contain snow <unk> and <unk> with <unk> that feed ten major asian rivers including the <unk> <unk> <unk> yellow and <unk> giving life to the continent's farms

we haven't done anything against nature or contributed to climate change but we are <unk> affected
in nepal climate change is already <unk> lives and <unk> scientists say
climate change is making things worse said <unk> <unk>
senior program officer for integrated climate risk management at the united nations development program
there are lots of dry <unk> <unk> with heavy rain in a short period of time that's causing flooding
farmers say that <unk> they've never seen before are eating their crops
the <unk> rains they've traditionally expected to arrive in june have become <unk> many say
we depend on timely rainfall for crop cultivation said <unk> <unk> a farmer who lives in a small village near the foot of the himalayas
we may not be able to feed ourselves or have the proper yield
the rain is either too late too little or too much
it wasn't like this before they say
<unk> mountains are <unk> with <unk> farms where families have <unk> the soil for generations
more than seventy percents of <unk> work in agriculture and most are <unk> farmers
many farmers like <unk> <unk> have seen landslides and floods destroy their <unk>
he <unk> up several years ago to his house <unk> as a flood swept over his <unk>
the river beating the stones made <unk> sounds that kept growing
i heard the sound of the <unk> rolling with the water
it felt like an <unk> said <unk> who lost his farm in <unk> near the himalayas
<unk> is identified as one of the most vulnerable districts to landslides according to a national study on climate change conducted by the nepalese government
the farmers say their <unk> is becoming harder and they don't know why
the people that are hit the hardest are not the ones causing the climate change said david <unk> director general of the kathmandu based international centre for integrated mountain development
that's the important message
the poorest people in the world are <unk> the least amount of carbon they're the ones who have to adapt dramatically to these changes
one of the issues is that some villages and homes are <unk> up too close to a river or in dangerous areas prone to landslides or floods
people who are building are unaware that they're in dire <unk> <unk> said
right now there's <unk> growth in very vulnerable places with houses sitting on river <unk>
the mountains have always carried risk of landslides <unk> and <unk> even without climate change
but new developments in vulnerable areas <unk> the risks of making them casualty events
the himalayas are changing the way people are living in the himalayas is changing too said <unk>
people are living closer to the river there are more <unk> and mountain <unk>
as everest has become more commercial the number of <unk> has increased
in two thousand and thirteen six hundred and fifty eight <unk> <unk> the peak compared with one hundred and ninety two two decades ago
about twenty thousand people a year now <unk> around the <unk>
more people climbing and <unk> means a greater probability of disasters that impact tourists and local <unk>
it's <unk> for local <unk> like <unk> chaudhary who are exposed to greater risks because of repeated trips
why would you want to go to the mountains
i only do it because i need to survive and i need the money he said
the only opportunities for <unk> <unk> men are to take a construction job in the middle east or work in tourism said chaudhary a <unk> man with a <unk> frame
he has to support his wife and two kids
during the <unk> he guided his two clients to safety after twelve hours
while dozens died went missing or had their hands <unk> from <unk> he and his two israeli <unk> survived without injuries

the annapurna <unk> was the effect of cyclone <unk> which <unk> india and wound up north in nepal in october
hundreds of tourists and local <unk> were stranded when the storms hit
people were not prepared they didn't get the warning signals like they should have said <unk>
while the annapurna event can not be <unk> ruled as a climate change related disaster it can't be ruled out either scientists say
the speculation to the link to climate change is we're getting more intense rainfall or <unk> said <unk>
it's so hard to say that event was due to climate change
all of these things have a relation
to prove that would be difficult
chaudhary <unk> his survival to the rings of ice that formed around his <unk> which blocked snow from <unk> into his bright orange <unk> saving his feet from <unk>
just three days later chaudhary <unk> the same <unk> and headed back to the mountains to guide another group <unk> <unk> to the clouds that for him and others were becoming increasingly difficult to <unk>

this story has stayed with me too challenging me to admit it when in my comfortable everyday existence i fail to demonstrate even a fraction of that empathy and self <unk>
but it's stayed with me in my <unk> identity as well
and it's made me wonder how much of our political and <unk> strife could be <unk> if we learned something from a young man who's been dead a half century but never gave in to fear or hate
look around our country today
look at the new york <unk> who feel so insulted that they think they must turn their backs on their mayor
look at the african american citizens of that city who feel that the <unk> has never shown them the respect those <unk> officers now demand
look at the online comment <unk> after ferguson and <unk> island
look at how black men in <unk> and white men with <unk> are <unk>
look at the escalation of outrage that leads to <unk> hashtag wars about whether <unk> or <unk>
look at the <unk> that <unk> from the <unk> of democrats as they <unk> for a <unk> gop congress and from republicans as they <unk> <unk> democrats
<unk> louis
there are two sides to america's policing issues
look now at the people in your own community
look at the way we walk past people whose circumstances are <unk> different from our own
perhaps they are <unk> or <unk> than you or more liberal or less or more self destructive or less
look at the way we <unk> moral meaning to those differences
look at the way we tell ourselves stories about what our <unk> are
look at the way those stories always accuse others of <unk> and excuse us for our own
look at the way those <unk> <unk> which start with those closest to us <unk> <unk>
i have been guilty of this kind of self justification both personal and political
so have you
and for all of us this season is an occasion to ask what it would take to earn the right to say these words
i know just how you feel
to some people this kind of radical compassion and loving <unk> seems <unk> <unk> a <unk> down the <unk> to moral <unk>
they fear that understanding the heart of another person particularly the enemy will lead to an <unk> of <unk> between self and other between right and wrong
but that's not how it was for michael <unk> and for the other freedom riders
they had a <unk> clear understanding of the moral differences between them and the last stand <unk> of jim <unk> between good and evil
their capacity for empathy <unk> them not to <unk> others but to invite them into <unk> and <unk> transform them
this power does not come easily
it takes a lot to say truly in the heat of conflict that you know how your <unk> feels
and to say nothing more no letting him off the <unk> no further demonstrations of your <unk>
<unk> few of us will ever <unk> the near <unk> <unk> open <unk> of young <unk>
but more of us can come closer
and when few of us even <unk> trying we get the political culture of today
<unk> for its own sake
politics as a game of <unk> rather than repeat play
citizens as <unk> <unk>
as we begin the new year as conflicts over race and class and guns and belonging continue to rage across the land let's resolve to learn just how someone feels
and to let that knowledge guide our lives as citizens
the u.n. security council in a close eight two vote with five <unk> on tuesday voted down a palestinian <unk> resolution that set a deadline for the withdrawal of israeli forces from palestinian territories by two thousand and seventeen
eight nations voted for the draft resolution one vote short of the necessary nine to be adopted including jordan which sponsored the resolution and three permanent security council members
china russia and france
the united states voted against the resolution on the table and had been expected to exercise its permanent council member authority and <unk> the measure had it passed

palestine currently is not recognized as a state
in november two thousand and twelve the general assembly voted to <unk> the status of the palestinians to non member <unk> state
<unk> <unk> jordan's ambassador to the united nations and the <unk> of the draft said she hoped the security council would have adopted the resolution because the council <unk> both the legal and the moral responsibilities to resolve the israeli palestinian conflict which is the <unk> of the conflict in the middle east
elements in the draft resolution including the right for palestinian people for self determination a two state solution with east jerusalem as the capital of palestine and an end to what it calls israeli occupation were acceptable not only to members of the security council but to the international community as a whole <unk> said
u.s
ambassador <unk> power said no other country in the world has invested more than the united states in pursuing peace between israel and the palestinians but said the resolution would undermine efforts to get back to an atmosphere that makes it possible to achieve two states for two people
power said that the current resolution was deeply <unk> and instead of giving a voice to both sides only considered the concerns of one
today's vote should not be interpreted as a victory for an <unk> status quo instead it should serve as a wake up call to <unk> all interested parties to take <unk> responsible steps to achieve a two state solution power said
australia also voted against the measure
the palestinian representative at the united nations <unk> mansour told the diplomats that it is most <unk> that the security council remains <unk>
the repeated requests for us to wait and wait and wait while our people are suffering while our people are besieged while our land is being <unk> and while the two state solution is being destroyed and the prospects for peace are <unk> must understand that such requests are not viable under these circumstances and are <unk> he said
the palestinians have found every possible opportunity to avoid direct negotiations with israel said israel <unk> a <unk> representing israel at the meeting and called the most recent <unk> draft the latest endeavor in a never ending string of political games

five countries <unk> from the vote including permanent member united kingdom
uk ambassador mark <unk> grant told the security council we consider president abbas a man of peace and understand the pressure that the palestinian leadership has been under to act and their frustration at the lack of progress
but we are disappointed that the normal and necessary negotiation did not take place on this occasion
after the meeting jordan's <unk> told reporters that although she would have liked more <unk> and negotiations to come up with a product that would be acceptable to the fifteen member states the importance of this resolution was to put some momentum and <unk> in the security council
heather cho the forty year old daughter of korean <unk> chairman is in the south seoul detention facility the seoul western district prosecutor's office said
officials gave no other details other than the investigation into the incident is ongoing
a spokesman for the office lee <unk> <unk> said an arrest warrant was approved because the <unk> was recognized because of the <unk> of the case and there was an attempt to <unk> cover up the charges since the beginning of the incident
cho resigned from her post as a vice president at the company in the aftermath of the incident earlier this month on a flight from new york's <unk> airport to south korea's <unk> international airport
she ordered that the plane turn back to the gate and that a flight attendant be removed because she was served nuts in a bag instead of on a plate in first class

amid public anger over her behavior she and her father both apologized for the incident
cho whose korean name is cho <unk> ah said she accepted full responsibility for what happened

the warrant was approved tuesday night
when contacted by cnn the press office for korean air said it had no comment on the latest development
testimony from crew members and passengers confirmed that cho used violent language in a loud voice which may not be <unk> with an aviation safety law that requires cooperation of passengers on a flight the ministry of land infrastructure and transport said earlier this month
the captain of the plane has also faced criticism for <unk> <unk> demands to turn back the plane and remove the flight attendant
the airline faces possible disciplinary action from the government because of the <unk> failure to command and <unk> crew members to ensure the safe operation of the flight the ministry said last week

<unk> and schools were just re opening and students brandishing little red books <unk> in factories or on farms
<unk> then a <unk> student leader from the philippines on a study tour found himself stuck in china after his name was placed on a <unk> by then philippines president <unk> <unk>
<unk> arrest as <unk> law was declared in his home country in september one thousand nine hundred and seventy two he stayed on along with four others from the study tour

the idea was to come for three weeks and see what was going on he says
i'm an <unk> tourist
he ended up staying for more than four decades and launching a career as a journalist just as china began opening up to the world
on his day of retirement from cnn he reflects on his ring side ticket to china's rise
what was life like under mao
when it became clear we were staying in china we wanted to study but <unk> weren't ready to <unk> foreign students so we asked to work
our hosts didn't make us but we insisted
i worked on a state farm in <unk> province
initially i found it a romantic idea but it didn't take long for the <unk> to wear off
at the end of the day we <unk> out two hours to learn chinese
our interpreter was our teacher and by the end of those few months on the farm i could <unk> in chinese
from late one thousand nine hundred and seventy two i worked on a fishing boat for two years
<unk> go out on the high seas for five or six days at a time on two <unk> ships pulling a huge net
it was a <unk> life very simple
it was sometimes <unk> but often also exciting because of the political campaigns that were going on
we would only watch from the <unk> see <unk> and in private discussions with chinese friends
we were told not to get involved
tell us about some of your memories of university and your circle of <unk>
i was in the class of one thousand nine hundred and seventy seven the first class when college students were enrolled through a nationwide entrance examination
among my <unk> was current premier <unk> <unk>
he studied law
also among them was bo <unk> once one of the most powerful politicians in china now <unk> and sentenced to life in prison for corruption and abuse of power
he was in my world history class
we would stand in the <unk> holding our <unk> of food there were no chairs to sit on and he <unk> to come close to foreign students like me
he knew enough english to <unk> with me and even then was quite <unk> and <unk>
a lot of that <unk> of fellow students are now in important roles in the government bureaucracy
some are top <unk> scientists and entrepreneurs
i've kept friends with many of them
they've been good <unk> <unk>
read
the good the bad and the exiled
china's class of one thousand nine hundred and seventy seven
you've witnessed the trial of the gang of four the <unk> massacre and the olympics
what else stands out
i covered <unk> concert the first western pop group to perform in china
it was attended by thousands of beijing residents most of whom just looked <unk>
police looked on <unk> if anyone stood up to cheer and dance
i remember when <unk> <unk> went on sale for the first time people thought it <unk> like a chinese medicine <unk>
later on it was a big treat to interview <unk> <unk> when he chosen as the number one <unk> draft
i'm a huge basketball fan and <unk> turned out to be a humble and <unk> guy although i got a <unk> neck
when i was at time my big <unk> was breaking the news of <unk> <unk> suicide several days before it was reported by xinhua
but to be honest <unk> like that were rare and perhaps less important than providing accurate and fair reports and analysis day after day week after week
read

you're the <unk> serving foreign correspondent in china
how has covering the country changed
it's easier than it used to be in the one thousand nine hundred and eighty s
there was a then ten day rule that required us to give notice if we wanted to leave beijing
<unk> except for <unk> we can now go anywhere as long as someone invited us
in recent years though there have been signs of <unk>
many colleagues including our own crew have had <unk> with authorities the hand in front of the camera
cnn comes under heavy scrutiny because it's so closely associated with the united states and we have been accused of <unk> reporting on china
i've had to explain to officials here that we're not an <unk> of u.s. government
we are independent
we report it as we see it
china is a much <unk> place than when you first arrived
have all the changes you've seen since the one thousand nine hundred and seventy s been for the better
i echo what my chinese friends would say
they enjoy much more personal freedom the freedom to travel to choose where to live to <unk> whoever they wish to take a job or quit a job
freedom of speech and expression has it limits but most people know where the red line lies
of course there are problems
many are the <unk> consequences of the reform that started thirty years ago like environmental pollution and <unk> and the lack of a spiritual <unk> for most chinese
i see a nation of one point three billion seemingly <unk> looking for direction and meaning in their lives even those who are rich
it's not a big secret
i think the government <unk> this crisis of faith
you've lived in china for forty years and raised a family here
how do you feel about it
i've lived here forty three years i've seen where it came from
i appreciate all the <unk> changes
i tend to look at china as a glass half full rather than half empty because i've seen it virtually empty
it was my refuge and later my training and battle ground as journalist
i feel <unk> to be ending my time here as a foreign correspondent
it's been a <unk> experience and not really the end
i'll still be involved in china watching in china or wherever my next projects and adventures take me
in the next few months my wife <unk> and i will stay on in beijing where she is <unk> employed
for a change i will be the <unk> <unk> but later i hope to do a bit of writing and <unk>
should you leave china what will you miss about it
china's been my second home although it will never replace the philippines as my homeland
i'll definitely not miss the beijing <unk> but will certainly miss the <unk> old neighborhood nearby including the men who belt out <unk> <unk> early in the morning their way of exercise my wake up call
i'll miss the <unk> <unk> of the beijing taxi drivers and their <unk> opinions
i'll miss the food <unk> <unk> <unk> duck and yes my <unk> foot <unk>
of course i'll miss my friends who've accepted me as a virtual beijing <unk>
what's your advice for journalists in china
the best stories are often of ordinary people doing extraordinary <unk>
keep up the good fight for fair honest and <unk> reporting
china has changed dramatically
i feel fortunate to have been in the right place at the right time to have witnessed these changes up close
for better or worse china now is a major player in the world
i never <unk> china could be so prosperous powerful and proud
whatever china does or does not do has impact on global affairs and our lives
for our sake and china's too i hope china will emerge as a peace loving global power

as we reach the conclusion of a difficult year for our family we wanted to take this opportunity to provide a further update regarding jules medical situation per our pledge to communicate continued information when appropriate to his many fans said the <unk> parents philippe and <unk> in a statement
it was a significant and very <unk> step for us to be able to bring jules home to france last month to continue his rehabilitation surrounded by his family and friends
this is very important for jules and also for us
jules <unk> status remains <unk>
he is unconscious but able to <unk> <unk>
whilst there is no significant information to report we take a great deal of comfort from the fact that jules continues to fight as we knew he would and this has <unk> the medical professionals caring for him to <unk> the planned but very <unk> program of rehabilitation therapy
<unk> parents say they will continue to provide <unk> of their son's progress and thanked the public for their ongoing support
the statement added
as we reflect on the events of the past few months we would like to <unk> once again the overwhelming <unk> and <unk> shown towards our son
these continue to be challenging times for our family but the knowledge that he has touched the lives of so many people all around the world has helped us through
earlier this month the <unk> published a report which stated that <unk> did not slow sufficiently to avoid losing control during his crash at the <unk> circuit
<unk> <unk> team <unk> in november after <unk> failed to find fresh investment
in the days after the crash <unk> moved to address accusations that <unk> had not reduced his speed and that the team had actively encouraged him not to do so
the <unk> f one team is shocked and angered by these allegations said the statement issued in october
at a time when its driver is critically ill in hospital and the team has made clear that its highest priority is <unk> for jules and his family it is <unk> to have to respond to deeply <unk> rumors and <unk> in respect of the circumstances of jules accident
regarding point one jules did slow down under the double waved yellow flags
that is an <unk> fact as proven by the <unk> data which the team has provided to the <unk>
regarding point two an audio copy of the full radio transmission between jules and the team and a written transcript were provided to the <unk>
it is quite clear from the transmission and the transcript that at no point during the period leading up to jules accident did the team urge jules to drive faster or make any comments suggesting that he should do so
the update on the french <unk> condition comes a day after the first anniversary of michael <unk> skiing accident
the seven time world champion is continuing his recovery from the severe head injuries sustained in a crash at the french ski resort of <unk> on twenty nine th december last year
<unk> spent nine months in hospital in france following emergency brain surgery but was moved to the family home near lake geneva in switzerland in september to continue his rehabilitation

militants say they <unk> an f sixteen jet manned by moaz al kassasbeh as he took part in u.s. led coalition air strikes near isis's de facto capital <unk> last week
images provided by the extremist <unk> media wing and circulated widely on social media showed bearded men with <unk> pulling the terrified <unk> out of a nearby river
we entered the region of <unk> to <unk> the area then the <unk> jets entered to begin their attack al kassasbeh said according to the online publication
my plane was struck by a heat seeking missile
i heard and felt its hit
the jordanian government and u.s. central command described the incident as an aircraft crash and <unk> stated that it was not shot down by isis
i checked the system display and it indicated that the engine was damaged and burning the pilot is quoted as saying
the plane began to <unk> from its normal flight path so i ejected
i landed in the <unk> river by <unk> and the seat caught on some ground keeping me fixed until i was captured by soldiers of the islamic state
a still image of al kassasbeh wearing the orange <unk> <unk> the short article titled
the capture of the <unk> pilot
journalist james foley american ngo founder peter kassig and british aid worker alan <unk> among other hostages wore similar <unk> in videos purporting to show their murders at the hands of the extremists
the magazine also contains an article claimed to have been <unk> by british hostage john <unk> <unk> <unk>
the article suggests the world is facing economic collapse and says it makes enormous sense for the islamic state to <unk> their own gold <unk>
<unk> was a photojournalist and freelance writer for major british newspapers before he was kidnapped in november two thousand and twelve along with american journalist james foley who was also killed by isis militants
the family of the captured jordanian pilot have made several emotional pleas for his release and called on the jordanian government to launch an investigation into the crash
be supportive of our brother moaz and to be <unk> on him please send him back to us <unk> al kassasbeh told cnn arabic last friday
he is just a soldier who is following orders and has no authority
jordan is one of several nations participating in an american led mission against isis an organization which is seeking to establish a caliphate or islamic state and has <unk> territory spanning from central syria to about one hundred km north of baghdad
the united nations says the group's acts of brutality including the enslavement of women mass killing and the torture and imprisonment of its enemies amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity
in two thousand and twelve i was diagnosed with stage three c ovarian cancer at age fifty two
as i watched dr. <unk> <unk> interview doctors researchers and two patients at <unk> new <unk> medical center <unk> cancer center i decided then and there that i wanted to be in a research trial
some days in our lives are <unk>
we all <unk> the good days <unk> <unk> and <unk>
june eight two thousand and twelve was not one of those days for me
that was the day i was diagnosed
i went immediately from being a lawyer mother and wife taking care of everyone to being a professional patient
read
why <unk> won't take down the <unk>
before diagnosis i did not know approximately twenty one thousand women are diagnosed with ovarian cancer <unk> in the united states and fourteen thousand five hundred women die from this disease
that's forty per day and one thousand two hundred per month
i am positive for the <unk> genetic <unk> <unk> via my father who carried the <unk> in his <unk>
women like me with this <unk> have a fifty percents chance of getting ovarian cancer in their lifetime
while women with <unk> cancer have a ninety percents five year survival rate women with ovarian cancer have a forty five percents five year survival rate
as there is no test to find it at an early stage when it is most <unk> it's most often found in the late stage when it is difficult to treat and life <unk> is at its lowest two point five years on average but i am now <unk> that average
i had seen my <unk> eight weeks before diagnosis and had a <unk> <unk> and a <unk> <unk> which were clear
over the next few weeks i began to experience <unk> <unk> appetite back pain and frequent <unk>
i had all the classic symptoms but was not seeing what they were signs of ovarian cancer
i hadn't paid attention because i was busy running my practice and my home
busy with life
suddenly june six i could not <unk> properly
my <unk> examined me and scheduled a <unk> <unk> the following day
then on june eight came the <unk> named cancer
read
how deep brain <unk> could <unk> secrets of <unk>
surgery was june eleven
after nine days collapsed <unk> from <unk> and losing over twenty pounds of <unk> a <unk> produced by the cancer i was released from the hospital and allowed a few weeks to heal
the <unk> report showed i had low grade <unk> cancer which is notoriously difficult to treat
i have a less than thirty five percents chance of living through the next five years
unfortunately there has been no breakthrough drug for ovarian cancer treatment in more than twenty years
my treatment began with <unk> three weeks on one week off
the drugs <unk> and <unk> were <unk> into my body
i spent the weeks off trying to clear my <unk> brain and raise my blood levels
i went through six of these <unk> spanning july to december two thousand and twelve
the treatment appeared to be effective but by may two thousand and thirteen i was back on <unk>
after sixteen <unk> in august two thousand and fourteen this too had stopped working
i was faced with the difficult decision of whether to try treatment that would further <unk> me or enter a <unk> trial
i knew i needed a new approach to my treatment and then the night came when i saw the show
the next day i called <unk> and learned a new ovarian cancer trial was about to start for which i might be eligible
they were seeking five patients and my timing appeared to be perfect
within four weeks i had cleared all the testing and began the trial
my form of cancer made me eligible as it releases certain <unk> which attract the <unk> drug <unk> it to attack in a targeted manner
i describe this as tactical airstrike treatment as opposed to most treatments which carpet bomb and kill healthy cells in our bodies as well as cancer cells
my treatments are weekly via <unk> for one hour
since it is a trial i also regularly undergo <unk> <unk> tests and the <unk> nurses check my vital signs to ensure that this drug is helping rather than <unk> me
after six treatments the cancer is stable and has not grown
thus i am allowed to continue treatment for another six weeks and undergo another <unk>
i know i am one of the fortunate women with a lot of support
my husband has been with me every step every day and <unk> in my care and the <unk> doctors and nurses have <unk> for me from the beginning to now
as i say regularly i am not in the mood to die yet
so one day at a time i will keep trying until we find something that will work even temporarily
perhaps this trial will keep me alive long enough for science to catch up and help find a cure for this and other <unk>

imagine you're the kind of person who worries about a future when robots become smart enough to <unk> the very existence of the human race
for years you've been dismissed as a <unk> <unk> to the same category of people who see <unk> <unk> in their <unk>
in two thousand and fourteen you found yourself in good company
this year <unk> the world's greatest living scientific mind stephen <unk> and its leading <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> voiced their fears about the potentially <unk> rise of artificial intelligence
they were joined by <unk> <unk> and computer scientists all of whom spoke out about the serious risks posed by the development of greater than human machine intelligence
in a widely cited <unk> <unk> co written with <unk> physicist <unk> <unk> nobel <unk> <unk> <unk> and computer scientist <unk> russell <unk> sounded the ai alarm
one can imagine <unk> financial markets out <unk> human researchers out <unk> human leaders and developing weapons we can not even understand
<unk> the short term impact of ai depends on who controls it the long term impact depends on whether it can be controlled at all
<unk> was reportedly more <unk> expanding on his tweeted warnings by calling ai <unk> biggest <unk> risk and <unk> it to <unk> the <unk>
the debate over ai was given a big boost this year by the publication of <unk> nick <unk> <unk>
paths dangers <unk> which makes a close study of just why and how ai may be so <unk> dangerous
<unk> is the director of the future of humanity institute at <unk> one of several new institutions devoted to studying <unk> threats to the human race of which ai figures <unk>
in may the massachusetts institute of technology <unk> its own future of life institute
in the academic community at least ai anxiety is booming
they're right to be worried
the first and most immediate issue is the potential for ai to put large numbers of humans out of work
a study by <unk> <unk> and michael <unk> of <unk> program on the <unk> of future technology put the matter <unk>
in their analysis of over seven hundred jobs almost half could be done by a computer in the future
this wave of <unk> could destroy not simply low wage low skill jobs but some white <unk> and service sector jobs previously thought to be <unk> as well
technology is marching on both our <unk> and mental labor
as serious a threat as widespread job loss is we've seen this movie before
during past technological <unk> humans have <unk> created jobs and industries from the <unk> of <unk> ones
we may be able to keep our collective heads above water even if ai <unk> on more creative and <unk> industries
what we should be more concerned about is humanity losing its <unk> as the earth's foremost intelligence
for those <unk> about ai current efforts to develop self <unk> <unk> coupled with the relentless growth in computer power and the increasing <unk> of sensors collecting all manner of intelligence and information around the world will push ai to human and ultimately <unk> intelligence
it's an event that's been dubbed the intelligence explosion a term <unk> in one thousand nine hundred and sixty five by computer scientist <unk> john good in a paper <unk> the development path for artificial intelligence
what makes an intelligence explosion so <unk> is that intelligence is not a tool or a technology
we may think of ai as something that we use like a <unk> or <unk> but that's <unk> the wrong way to think about it
sufficiently advanced intelligence like <unk> is a creative force
the more powerful it is the more it can <unk> the world around it
artificial intelligence does not need to be <unk> to be <unk> dangerous to humanity
when computer scientists talk about the possible threat to humanity from <unk> ai they don't mean the <unk> or <unk>
instead it's typically a more <unk> end
humanity <unk> out because an ai tasked with a simple goal <unk> all the energy and <unk> materials on earth to <unk> <unk> out paper <unk> <unk> and out <unk> all human attempts to stop it
in <unk> telling there are always humans left to fight back but such an outcome is <unk> if humanity is faced with a truly superior intelligence
it would be like <unk> attempting to <unk> a human
in that event ai researchers like <unk> <unk> see a less inspiring <unk>
all the people are dead
<unk> to say not everyone shares this <unk> forecast
in the ai <unk> camp <unk> and google director of engineering ray <unk> also sees intelligent machines <unk> human extinction of a sort only in <unk> telling humanity is not <unk> but <unk> into a <unk> machine
<unk> human machine <unk> is not a <unk> catastrophe but the ultimate liberation from <unk> biological <unk>
others are skeptical that ai will ever reach human levels of intelligence and <unk> let alone <unk> it
some like new york <unk> <unk> <unk> are on the <unk>
i don't know of any proof that we should be worried <unk> told me this year but nor of any proof that we should not be worried
<unk> john good famously described the development of an <unk> machine as the last <unk> that man need ever make for after that humanity would <unk> innovation and technological development to its <unk> <unk>
even if it's not a straight line from <unk> to extinction we humans should probably be watching our machines just a bit more closely
gone are the days of the <unk> camera phone images with the resolution of a poor <unk> <unk>
today's smartphone cameras are so advanced that mobile photography is becoming an art form in its own right turning photo sharing apps like instagram into <unk> <unk> for <unk> photographers and professionals like street style photographer <unk> <unk> and chief official white house photographer <unk> <unk>
you have the dark room in your pocket says pierre le <unk> the paris based founder of out of the phone the world's first publishing house dedicated to mobile photography
this month out of the phone follows its <unk> publication last year's book of mobile photos from two time <unk> prize nominated photographer richard <unk> hernandez with out of the phone
the mobile photo book two thousand and fourteen a diverse selection of one hundred instagram images taken by users from twenty five countries
before founding out of the phone in two thousand and thirteen le <unk> ran a fine art photography printing company that counted <unk> <unk> and william <unk> as clients
he first started following mobile photography on instagram in two thousand and eleven and was surprised and impressed by the quality of work that <unk> were creating
now there are many well known photographers who use the platform but at the very beginning there were many people who didn't know so much about photography and these were the kind of people that i wanted to showcase he says
but on the other hand it was also something confusing because there are too many images
the desire to <unk> what he was seeing coupled with a longtime ambition to create books led him to give publishing a try
while le <unk> had <unk> a number of established photographers to feature in this year's <unk> <unk> he also gave instagram users the chance to put themselves up for <unk> using the hashtag <unk> to <unk> their best works
he was <unk> to receive over twenty thousand <unk>
what was he looking for in a successful entry
technical skill was <unk> important but le <unk> says he also sought something less tangible
at the end what is important is the story and the <unk> of the photographer
it's a mix between a good story a good composition he says
photography for me is a sort of fresh air a way to look at things differently
so i'm looking for that sort of feeling when i look at pictures
now that the mobile photo book has been published le <unk> is looking forward to promoting his concept and expanding
he's looking to start <unk> in the new year and <unk> investors and partners
several projects are set for release next year including books from award winning documentary photographer benjamin <unk> and other photographers he believes are using the medium to its <unk>

the individual was transferred to the hospital by the scottish ambulance service yesterday after falling ill while visiting <unk> in the scottish <unk>
meanwhile a health care worker who was diagnosed with the ebola virus after returning to scotland from sierra leone was transferred to the royal free hospital in london
the patient is <unk> cafferkey thirty nine of glasgow scotland the hospital said
she was working with save the children at an ebola treatment center said michael <unk> <unk> humanitarian director at that organization
she traveled via <unk> morocco and london heathrow airport before arriving at glasgow airport on a british airways flight late sunday the health agency <unk> scotland said
after feeling <unk> she sought medical attention and became the first person to be diagnosed with ebola within the united kingdom
british media outlets said cafferkey is a public health nurse in <unk> south <unk> area who was part of a thirty strong team of medical volunteers deployed to west africa by the uk government last month in a joint endeavor with save the children
she was reportedly transferred to london in a military aircraft <unk> with an isolation <unk>
the royal free hospital is equipped with a high level isolation unit with access restricted to specially trained medical staff
a specially designed tent with controlled <unk> is set up over the patient's bed
a british volunteer nurse william <unk> was successfully treated in the unit after he was brought home from sierra leone in august having been diagnosed with ebola there
uk authorities are working to trace those who have come into contact with cafferkey
the scottish government has set up a special number for people to call if they traveled on the same london heathrow to glasgow flight as cafferkey
british airways said it was working closely with health authorities in england and scotland and would help with any information needed
the safety and security of our customers and crew is always our top priority and the risk to people on board that individual flight is extremely low the airline said
ebola patients become infectious only after they display symptoms such as <unk> and <unk>

a <unk> street spokesman told cnn that british prime minister david cameron and scottish first minister <unk> <unk> had discussed the procedures in place to handle such a case
they agreed that both governments would remain in close touch and ensure everything possible was done to support the patient and although the risk to the general population remained low all measures would be taken to protect public health

news agency <unk> reported that navalny was detained by police and was returned to his home instead of being taken to jail
he was on house arrest for a conviction in a two thousand and nine case
earlier navalny was in court where he got a three and a half year suspended sentence for the <unk> conviction while his brother <unk> also convicted of <unk> was given a prison term of the same length
both were hit with steep fines but only <unk> navalny was ordered to pay
when the sentence was read <unk> navalny shouted out in anger and frustration with the judgment against his brother
the brothers denied charges of <unk> thirty million <unk> from a russian <unk> of french cosmetics company <unk> <unk> between two thousand and eight and two thousand and twelve
there were strong feelings among some in moscow that the brothers should not have been sentenced as they were
despite the <unk> winter cold their supporters gathered near the kremlin in <unk> <unk> square tuesday night to rally against the <unk>
a facebook page promoting the event predicted that thousands would attend but the numbers were far smaller as the protest got underway
the sentencing hearing was originally scheduled for january fifteen when a big rally was planned but was brought forward at a <unk> notice leading <unk> supporters to <unk> what they said was an attempt to <unk> protest
many people have left moscow ahead of the new year public holiday making it harder to muster a crowd
the protest is likely considered illegal because <unk> supporters didn't have enough time to apply for the <unk> required under russian law raising the prospect of a confrontation between protesters and police
after the sentencing navalny supporters also accused the kremlin of using <unk> navalny as <unk> against his brother
however they did voice surprise that the sentences were not <unk>
prosecutors had asked for <unk> navalny to be given a ten year prison sentence and <unk> to receive an eight year term
a corruption fighting lawyer <unk> navalny famously branded the ruling united russia party founded by president vladimir putin the party of <unk> and <unk>
he was a prominent <unk> of mass street protests three years ago and has attacked corruption in russian government using his blog and social media

indonesian searchers battled bad weather wednesday in their efforts to find more remains from airasia flight qz eight thousand five hundred and one a day after the first signs of debris were spotted
there was conflicting information about whether any parts of the plane had been located underwater
one search official told cnn that he believes sonar equipment has detected wreckage from the plane at the bottom of the sea
i think that that's the case said muhammad <unk> the head of search and rescue for the city of surabaya where flight eight thousand five hundred and one began its journey on sunday
he was <unk> back earlier comments he made to cnn in which he said the sonar equipment had located wreckage from the plane
indonesia's national search and rescue chief said the body of the aircraft hasn't yet been discovered
until now we haven't found the plane bambang soelistyo said according to indonesia's national news agency <unk>
we've only found seven bodies to this day
the grim discovery tuesday of parts of the missing plane and several bodies on the surface of the sea dealt a heartbreaking blow to families whose loved ones were lost
debris was found one hundred two hundred kilometers from the aircraft's last known location over the java sea indonesia's search and rescue agency said
seven bodies four men and three women have been recovered from the water so far soelistyo said
one of the women found was wearing a flight <unk> uniform he said
search teams are looking for other bodies and parts of the plane including its so called black boxes
those could help investigators determine what went wrong on the flight which lost contact with air traffic controllers on sunday with one hundred and sixty two people aboard
sonar equipment has been searching the bottom of the sea tens of meters below the <unk> surface according to <unk> supriyadi the search agency's director of operations
dozens of ambulances were lined up in the indonesian city of surabaya ready to carry any bodies recovered
the search isn't easy
heavy wind and rain as well as big waves are <unk> efforts officials said
as families watched a live news conference tuesday about the discovery of the debris and saw video of a helicopter <unk> a <unk> to what appeared to be a floating body some people <unk>
<unk> were brought into the room
family members burst into tears <unk> their eyes as officials passed out <unk>
some sat with their eyes full of tears hands covering their <unk> or heads buried in their hands
others had phones <unk> against their <unk>
everyone became <unk> especially the mothers
one mother even <unk> out said maria <unk> <unk> whose daughter son in law and two grandchildren were on the flight
her husband imam <unk> said he was relieved the plane had been found
we hope that our children will be saved by a miracle he said
airasia ceo tony fernandes told reporters he hoped there was at least some <unk> for families
my heart is filled with sadness for all the families involved in qz eight thousand five hundred and one he tweeted
on behalf of airasia my condolences to all
words can not express how sorry i am
soelistyo the head of indonesia's search and rescue agency said the debris was discovered when a crew on a military aircraft spotted the <unk> of an object that looked like a plane in the water off the coast of indonesia's central <unk> province on <unk>
further searching found floating objects believed to be the bodies of passengers and then what appeared to be an emergency exit of the plane
officials sent other search teams racing to the area
several nations are contributing resources to the effort including the united states
the u.s. navy <unk> uss <unk> arrived tuesday
the uss fort worth is also being prepared to <unk> from singapore pentagon spokesman rear <unk> john kirby said
it can be ready to sail in a day or two to get on station and can be there very quickly he said
the united states is also preparing maritime patrol aircraft that could help he said
the flight which was lost sunday on its way to singapore was carrying one hundred and fifty five passengers and seven crew members
the overwhelming majority were <unk>
there were also citizens of britain france malaysia singapore and south korea
search and rescue teams are <unk> all their resources to where the debris is in the <unk> <unk> about one hundred and ten nautical miles southwest of the indonesian city of <unk> bun airasia said
fernandes said the focus for now must remain on the recovery effort and no sweeping changes were planned for the airline which has one thousand flights a day
but rest assured he said that once the investigation is done if there are things we need to change that we will change it
the airbus a three hundred and twenty two hundred lost contact with air traffic control early sunday shortly after the pilot requested permission to turn and climb to a higher altitude because of bad weather according to indonesian officials
authorities mounted a huge effort to find the aircraft <unk> out a search zone covering one hundred and fifty six thousand square kilometers
questions remain about why flight eight thousand five hundred and one lost contact with air traffic control and what happened afterward
some experts have said the aircraft might have experienced an <unk> stall because of a lack of speed or from flying at too sharp an angle to get enough lift
analysts have also suggested the pilots might not have been getting information from onboard systems about the plane's position or that rain or <unk> from thunderstorms in the area could have damaged the engines
the key to understanding what happened is likely to be contained in the aircraft's flight recorders
until we get the black boxes we won't know what's going on with the engines said bill <unk> a former pilot with thirty years of experience

relatives of mh three hundred and seventy victims speak out about airasia qz eight thousand five hundred and one
what happened to malaysia airlines flight three hundred and seventy and will we ever find it
watch <unk>
the mystery of malaysia airlines flight three hundred and seventy tonight at nine p.m
et
an airliner <unk> over the waters of a southeast asia ocean
there's no distress call no wreckage nothing but water and questions
so far the story of airasia flight qz eight thousand five hundred and one sounds <unk> similar to that of malaysia airlines mh three hundred and seventy which remains missing nearly ten months after it disappeared from radar <unk> on a flight between <unk> <unk> malaysia and beijing
but it isn't analysts say
here are four ways the two incidents appear to <unk>
one
there's not anywhere near as much <unk>
when mh three hundred and seventy disappeared the plane's identifying <unk> appeared to be <unk> shut off its pilots stopped making radio <unk> and the airliner made a mysterious turn before possibly traveling for hours until all <unk> <unk>
concerns over <unk> and terror <unk> that case but so far they haven't come up in the airasia case
in this case you had normal communications with the pilot a line of weather that appeared to be pretty difficult severe and he was asking to climb as high as he could to get out of it said peter goelz an aviation expert and former national transportation safety board official
two
the water is much <unk> and a <unk> used shipping channel making wreckage easier to find
the area where mh three hundred and seventy is believed to have gone down features <unk> deep water
it's also relatively mysterious the <unk> had never been <unk> in some places making getting a fix on the plane's <unk> very difficult
in the airasia case if the plane went down in the water it likely <unk> in no more than a few hundred feet of heavily traveled ocean making the task of <unk> and recovering it much <unk> analysts say
three
airlines and governments have learned a lot since mh three hundred and seventy
in the hours after the malaysia airlines <unk> <unk> in march confusion <unk>
when officials spoke at all the information was often <unk> or confusing and families of passengers and crew complained about how they were treated
in this case both government and airline officials appear to be striking a more appropriate tone
families of airasia flight passengers given support through the nightmare
airasia ceo tony fernandes tweeted that his only thought was the passengers and crew and pledged to do whatever we can
malaysian defense minister <unk> hussein also tweeted his support
i will be there with you he said
and the search appears to be getting off to a more efficient start
indonesian officials quickly posted a search plan indicating ships from its navy as well as assets from malaysia singapore and australia were being called to help
cnn's will <unk> said the way fernandes is handling the crisis is notable
what he's doing is something that malaysia airlines did not do in the initial hours the initial days and weeks which is being very <unk> <unk> this is a terrible situation <unk> said
in this case it appears as though the airline and the authorities are in <unk> and they really are putting the families first which is the way to do it
four
we almost certainly won't be searching for this plane in ten months
with a more precise fix on where the plane was when it lost contact a smaller search area and <unk> seas the airliner almost certainly will be much easier to find said steven <unk> former director of the federal aviation <unk> office of accident investigations
it's very unlikely that we're going to see anything <unk> close to what we saw with malaysia three hundred and seventy he said
it will not surprise me if this airplane is found in the next twelve hours of <unk> because they know to a <unk> high degree of <unk> where it was the water is one hundred and fifty feet deep as opposed to ten or twenty thousand feet deep in the indian ocean

her <unk> family was traveling to japan via singapore she said
i knew about this incident from watching tv and tried to get more information from my family
but my brother never flew with airasia so i kept calm
then someone told me that they saw his name on tv
then i saw it she said breaking down in tears
we are just waiting for news
now they just wait
we don't know what to do she said
we are just waiting for news
two young teenage schoolgirls arrived at <unk> international in the early hours
according to relatives and school officials who were traveling with the girls they are friends whose parents were on the flight
the parents were traveling to singapore to spend new year's with their daughters
that flight never arrived so the girls traveled to surabaya to find out what had happened to their parents
they sat at a desk <unk> by airasia officials looking lost and <unk> as they waited for information
at <unk> airport in singapore <unk> <unk> told channel <unk> her fiance and his family were on the plane
when i was on the way to the airport i <unk> to the radio and they said his plane was missing she said
it was supposed to be his last vacation with his family before the wedding she said
indonesia is by far the hardest hit in this mystery because one hundred and forty nine of the one hundred and fifty five passengers were from that country
surabaya is the crisis center
airasia group ceo and founder tony fernandes flew in late sunday night
his first words at the news conference
we are very devastated by what's happened it's <unk>
our concern right now is for the relatives and for the next of <unk> there is nothing more important to us for our <unk> family and for the passengers families
on monday morning he briefed the families behind closed doors
it's not known what he said
airasia staff has been taking families from <unk> international to the nearby <unk> hotel to keep them together and critically to keep them informed
many family members are in shock
they're <unk> eyed <unk> <unk> and afraid
some are grieving
others <unk> pure despair
children are among them in some cases clearly too young to <unk> what's going on
i should have gone with them but i canceled it two weeks ago as i had something to do one relative of a passenger said <unk> according to a translation by channel <unk>
speaking at <unk> international airport the relative whose name was not given said this morning before i went to pray one of them called me and <unk> said see you in the new year and goodbye forever
that's all and then the bad news came
we still have hope
william kai waiting in surabaya for news of his brother in law and three other relatives who were on the flight said he's hopeful the plane will be found soon according to the bbc
this flight is only from surabaya to singapore so it's not like it's missing in the indian ocean or the big seas he said
it's just there
so it should be easier to find
he also said he's not giving up hope for the safe return of his relatives
we still have hope he said
we can not lose hope
the losses will be felt around the world
while nearly everyone on the flight is from indonesia there are also three south koreans one malaysian a french co pilot one <unk> and one singaporean the airline said
sixteen passengers were children and one was an infant

we will do everything possible to support them as the investigation continues and have already mobilized a support team to help take care of their immediate needs including accommodation and travel <unk> he said
fernandes took to twitter to <unk> families and offer more information
i am touched by the massive show of support especially from my fellow airlines he wrote
this is my worse nightmare
but there is no stopping
the company switched its <unk> on its twitter and facebook pages from bright red to gray
peter goelz a cnn aviation analyst <unk> a task force that wrote the aviation disaster family assistance act of one thousand nine hundred and ninety six which the u.s. congress passed to provide <unk> on how to deal with families when responding to these types of crises
that legislation set the worldwide standard in aviation disaster response according to goelz and <unk> of it have been adopted by virtually every country including indonesia
the key is families need to hear it first
they need to hear what's going on and they need to hear it from the investigators goelz said on cnn's state of the union

when we imagine the robots of the future they often look and move like humans standing up on two legs and using a pair of arms to grab and move objects
nasa's jet <unk> laboratory is working on a different kind of robot for disaster response that's designed to move like an <unk>
<unk> but covered with seven cameras that act as eyes the <unk> has four <unk> <unk> that do double duty as arms and legs
together they <unk> move the robot across rough terrain and rubble but can also pick up and <unk> objects
it has wheels it can coast on if the surface is smooth enough
the robosimian is <unk> final entry into the <unk> robotics challenge a twenty seven month long competition among some of the world's top robotic talent to create an emergency response robot
in situations such as a nuclear disaster one of these robots could go into <unk> too dangerous for human rescue workers and <unk> simple tasks such as <unk> debris off survivors or turning off a <unk>
in june robosimian and up to eighteen other <unk> will have to make their way through an <unk> course that <unk> eight common scenarios
each robot will attempt to drive a car move across rubble use a tool and climb <unk> all without a human controlling it
<unk> says the final competitors should be as <unk> as a two year old child
the winning team will receive a two million dollar prize
<unk> used <unk> parts from robosimian to create another robot called <unk>
the more traditional <unk> robot has a flexible <unk> head and two arms
while better at <unk> objects <unk> ran on tracks and wasn't as <unk> at <unk> the complicated terrain that is common in a disaster
after considering both candidates the team decided to take robosimian to the <unk>
one trade off is that <unk> is slower than many other competitors
<unk> team is working with the university of california santa barbara and <unk> to increase the <unk> walking speed
it is <unk> the <unk> relative to the other <unk> in the <unk> feel that a very stable and deliberate approach <unk> our technical <unk> and provides a model for one vital element of the ecosystem of robots that we expect to be deployed to disaster scenarios in the future said <unk> <unk> kennedy who is <unk> of the robotic vehicles and <unk> group
the jet <unk> laboratory is most known for designing robotics for space exploration such as the mars <unk>
but the <unk> competition was an opportunity for the <unk> group to take its existing robotics research and <unk> <unk> directly to other <unk> teams
nasa also has a long history of taking technology developed for space exploration and using it here on earth
robosimian software was influenced by programs used to control the mars <unk>
in both cases the system is designed to let the robots work as <unk> as possible when communication with a human operator is dropped
<unk> communications are common in disaster scenarios
the team has thought hard about all aspects of <unk> design even making sure it has the right look
we included industrial designers in the team in an effort to create a robot that looked professional rather than either threatening or <unk> <unk> said kennedy
basically we wanted the <unk> equivalent of a st. bernard
while <unk> is focused on <unk> the <unk> like design for earth bound applications for now this is just one stop in the <unk> life of nasa technology
we intend to <unk> the technologies developed for the <unk> robosimian back out to applications in space said kennedy
these tasks include assembly and maintenance of <unk> structures
exploration of low <unk> bodies like <unk> <unk> and <unk>
exploration of <unk> and <unk> on mars or our moon
and even <unk> of <unk> wherever humans care to <unk> in the solar system
the mission of impact your world and our <unk> is change the story
not only do we bring you the latest news on all cnn's platforms but where possible we provide ways on the network and on cnn dot com impact to get involved and to donate to help those whose stories we tell
only sometimes we can't
a missing plane a sinking ferry a random act of violence whether it's in your state half way across the country or the other side of the world these <unk> appear on your phone at work in your living room
you feel powerless and so frequently do we
the <unk> is to help
unfortunately sometimes effective ways to help are hard to come by
it's often while situations are still developing and cnn's coverage is the most in depth that the desire to impact is strongest
images of the family members of passengers on asia air eight thousand five hundred and one <unk> and desperate for news are heart wrenching
the families of passengers on the burning ferry pleading for rescuers to work faster fill us all with sadness horror and sympathy
they make us wonder
what if it were my child my mother my husband
how can i help
<unk> it is often when stories are still <unk> that the answer too frequently is that all we can do is wait
we don't know when or whether people will be found or what medical <unk> will be
we wish we did
sometimes ways to help are part of a bigger picture
when schoolgirls are kidnapped by a militant group it is in the hands of the governments to get them out and all we can do is wait
but to help stop it from ever happening again we can provide links to connect you with organizations working to <unk> <unk> to education for girls worldwide
we may not be able to stop children from being recruited as soldiers by armed militias but we can connect you with unicef who is working to end the participation of children in armed conflict
often we rely on you
we don't always know about how you are working to raise funds raise awareness volunteer or get involved
but we want to know so keep us in the loop by tweeting <unk>
sometimes the best way to get involved is to stay informed aware ask questions
imagine if it were your child or <unk> <unk> that was in <unk> way and ask could the response be improved
at cnn our first <unk> is to bring you all the facts provide context and keep everyone involved honest
armed with this information we hope you'll decide just how you want to impact your world

hillary clinton hasn't said whether she's going to run for president in two thousand and sixteen
and massachusetts sen. elizabeth warren has said repeatedly that she's not planning to run
but given the <unk> of today's politics the two women need each other
and they both should run for the democratic nomination
a primary challenge from warren could be the very best thing to happen to clinton in a run for the presidency
most <unk> have argued that a warren challenge would be a problem that clinton needs to confront a genuine <unk> in her path to the presidency
the division and <unk> they say would be a repeat of the two thousand and eight <unk> where she ultimately lost to barack obama
but a warren candidacy could have a very healthy effect for clinton and for the democratic party
the biggest challenge that clinton faces right now assuming that she <unk> to run is that she might be unable to generate enough excitement among democrats that would <unk> voters and <unk> the media in the general election
part of the problem <unk> around the same old issue of <unk>
as in two thousand and eight people treat her candidacy as a given and <unk> that she would be the likely democratic <unk>
in american politics voters tend to like the <unk>
when clinton hit the campaign trail in two thousand and eight as the inevitable winner she often fell flat
obama used the image of <unk> against her
indeed some of the <unk> moments in her campaign came toward the end when it became clear that obama was probably going to win the nomination
her fight intensified and she made a much stronger appeal to key elements of the democratic party
as new york sen. <unk> <unk> recently reminded his party democrats do best when they deal with the issues facing the middle class and advance an agenda that focuses on economic security for all
far from being radical this has been the kind of policy agenda for which democratic voters <unk>
it was the heart of the new deal and the great society as well as successful democratic <unk> campaigns and the two thousand and eight election
in recent times democrats have done well when they pay attention to the middle class and suffer when they move too far away from these issues
this kind of agenda could inspire democratic voters and attract <unk> who are frustrated with the continued challenges facing the middle class
if warren forces clinton to confront these issues and to <unk> a stronger response to the economic issues of our days creating <unk> pressure to the political experts who will <unk> her to stay away from these questions it would only make the former first lady and secretary of state a stronger candidate
<unk> candidacy would force clinton to put herself on the record over how she would help the middle class committing to the kinds of policies that will be <unk> to many voters including some <unk> and even moderate republicans who are struggling in this economy and who are uncomfortable with the solutions offered by a gop that continues to <unk> hard to the right
a warren candidacy would also put pressure on <unk> team to make sure they pay close attention to the grass roots
in the two thousand and eight <unk> the clinton campaign <unk> in dealing with the political ground war the job of <unk> and organizing local activists and <unk> social media to bring out supporters
if there is no democratic challenger clinton might not do enough to prepare for the onslaught she would face from a gop a party armed with tea party activists and a huge network of campaign donors ready for battle
if warren runs clinton will be forced to have her campaign infrastructure in place and in top form before the general election campaign begins
there is also the <unk> of clinton <unk> her basic campaign skills
although she has never really left politics since her husband's election as president in one thousand nine hundred and ninety two she is probably a bit <unk> as her book <unk> in june showed
in the current media environment there is no room for mistakes and given that the republicans might have some pretty strong candidates in the mix she will have to be at the top of her game
clinton is an <unk> skilled politician and can compete with the best but the challenge of running against warren would make her stronger by the fall of two thousand and sixteen
both candidates would benefit from a real primary
polls show clinton has a <unk> lead against any challenger including warren so the odds are this would not be a genuine threat to her nomination
but a primary would vastly <unk> <unk> <unk> on <unk> hill and give her a bigger profile within the party for years to come
for clinton a <unk> challenge from the base of the party will be just the kind of <unk> <unk> that she needs

fans are <unk> for more disappointment

<unk> for their ultimate self portrait <unk> cameras <unk> on old <unk> <unk> up for their own selfie against <unk> that bring out their best <unk>
no <unk> necessary
these unusual photos offer a view of the <unk> forgotten film cameras that brought us to the digital age and <unk> in the selfie
wanting to capture the rich history of <unk> in a modern striking fashion photographer and engineer <unk> novotny developed <unk> a continuing project featuring cameras from the one thousand nine hundred and twenty s <unk>
novotny has a personal tie to some of these <unk> cameras
the <unk> <unk> was a gift from his father when he turned six
it gave him the outlet to deal with his creative <unk> he said the freedom to <unk> <unk> and generate special <unk> views on a situation
this passion turned into a <unk> with <unk> ranging from still life to surreal landscapes
novotny could think of no better way to pay <unk> to the medium of his work than by having the cameras themselves display their true colors
he began to collect historic cameras from friends or on auction sites like <unk> for little to nothing
i learned that <unk> cameras seemed in fact to be forgotten
beautiful and still great equipment i couldn't afford a few years ago are now available for a few <unk>
good for me but somehow sad novotny said <unk> him a bit of the toy story movie
what if those abandoned and forgotten cameras would try to depict themselves and their situation
without users anymore looking back upon their glorious times
he said
thus the idea for <unk> was born
the photographs themselves are not <unk> in the traditional definition
novotny captures them with his modern digital <unk> <unk> t one in a small modest studio
i tried to capture them in their natural and <unk> correct environment on backgrounds of contemporary <unk> he said
<unk> uses the <unk> trend to remind the <unk> of the <unk> of photography and also keep in mind that <unk> photography is more than noise reduction smile detection and technical <unk> he said
these cameras are not only tools reduced to their technical data but also still an inspiration for artists and a source for creativity
here the <unk> is out of the frame the cameras and the creative potential they offer stand in the <unk>

the disappearance of airasia flight eight thousand five hundred and one between indonesia and singapore over the weekend and discovery of debris from the plane two days later <unk> a bizarre year in aviation
but could two thousand and fourteen be the worst year in recent aviation history
yes and no
depends on how you <unk> worst
in terms of crashes two thousand and fourteen has seen the lowest number in more than eighty years says the geneva based bureau of aircraft accidents <unk> or baaa
with the airasia disappearance now counted as a crash this year's number <unk> one hundred and eleven
the last time the world had one hundred and eleven crashes was in one thousand nine hundred and twenty seven
if you consider sheer numbers of aircraft crashes flying today is safer says <unk> ray an analyst with the international bureau of aviation a global aviation consulting group
however there are more aircraft in the sky so naturally the overall number may appear similar to previous decades and in some <unk> of disaster higher
in terms of fatalities the numbers paint a <unk> picture
before airasia qz eight thousand five hundred and one aviation disasters this year claimed one thousand one hundred and fifty eight lives
the airasia flight was carrying one hundred and sixty two people
authorities have not issued a statement on whether everybody died
if all the people on board died this year would have the most aviation deaths one thousand three hundred and twenty since two thousand and five according to baaa
already two thousand and fourteen has put an end to a steadily improving global aviation safety record
every ten years or so we have a year that is less safe than others
unfortunately this year was one of those said <unk> <unk> with the baaa
last year two hundred and sixty five people were killed in flight incidents marking the safest year in aviation since one thousand nine hundred and forty five the aviation safety network said
the aviation safety network and the baaa track their numbers differently
the aviation safety network says its figures on fatal aircraft accidents include only civil aircraft of which the basic model has been <unk> for carrying fourteen or more passengers
the baaa includes accidents of aircraft capable of carrying at least six passengers besides the crew
another key difference
the aviation safety network doesn't include fatalities from malaysia airlines flight seventeen because it does not count shoot <unk> or acts of <unk> in its safety <unk> numbers
the baaa statistics count any event where aircraft suffered such damage that it is not in a position to be used anymore
before two thousand and fourteen malaysia airlines had an excellent safety record
then in march malaysia airlines flight three hundred and seventy disappeared en route from <unk> <unk> to beijing with two hundred and thirty nine aboard
officials believe that plane is somewhere in the indian ocean
but nine months later mh three hundred and seventy hasn't been found
in july malaysia airlines flight seventeen was shot down over eastern ukraine killing all two hundred and ninety eight aboard
while airasia is based in malaysia the flight that crashed sunday was operated by airasia indonesia an affiliate with hubs in jakarta and surabaya
the wreckage was not found until tuesday creating a fear that two <unk> had disappeared in the same year in the same part of the world
search teams located airasia debris on tuesday in the java sea
airasia had a near <unk> safety record with no previous fatal accidents
but now that record has changed
this is my worst nightmare airasia ceo tony fernandes tweeted as crews searched for airasia qz eight thousand five hundred and one
two other disasters claimed dozens of lives both in july
in taiwan forty eight died on <unk> airways flight two hundred and twenty two
the cause of that crash is unclear
the crash of air <unk> flight five thousand and seventeen killed one hundred and sixteen people while en route from <unk> <unk> to algeria
the plane went down in mali
the cause of that crash is also <unk> but the plane changed flight paths because of bad weather
when air disasters happen they make news
but on the whole far fewer people die in plane crashes than in cars
about one point two four million people die each year on the world's roads the world health organization said last year
by contrast the deadliest year in aviation had three thousand three hundred and forty six deaths the baaa said
that was in one thousand nine hundred and seventy two
since then technology has improved and airlines <unk> companies and <unk> have worked to increase aviation safety levels to get closer to zero risk said <unk>
accidents are not always <unk> he said but with each accident we learn something new and improve
according to the international civil aviation organization the number of commercial flight <unk> has grown in recent years to thirty million in two thousand and eleven
despite the fatalities from this year goelz said that's a relatively low rate when you <unk> it to the massive numbers of people who are flying today

smoke spotted rising from an island in the java sea
as ships planes and helicopters <unk> the waters off indonesia's coast for missing airasia flight qz eight thousand five hundred and one there have been several reports of possible signs of the missing plane
so far officials say none of them have <unk> out
on tuesday search teams will be checking the area where indonesian navy helicopter crews saw the smoke the head of search and rescue in the province of <unk> <unk> told cnn indonesia
but authorities don't know whether there's any connection to the missing jet
local media in indonesia reported the smoke was seen on long island one of thousands that make up the <unk> that forms indonesia
searchers have been <unk> the <unk> surface for signs of the plane which went missing with one hundred and sixty two people aboard on sunday as it flew between the islands of <unk> and <unk> a heavily traveled shipping channel with shallow waters
our early <unk> is that the plane is in the bottom of the sea said bambang sulistyo the head of indonesia's search and rescue agency
that belief is based on the plane's flight track and last known <unk> he said
several possible signs of the missing plane including an oil slick within the search zone and the sound of a <unk> <unk> have been <unk> according to indonesian authorities who are heading the search
indonesia vice president <unk> <unk> said there were some reports from australia about possible objects found but it was unclear whether they were from the plane
because there is a great deal of traffic along the water in the search area authorities have cautioned that objects found might have nothing to do with the missing aircraft
rescuers say weather was probably a factor in the plane's disappearance and it has made finding <unk> of the plane more difficult
large waves and clouds hampered the search for the plane on sunday and monday
it is not easy of course
the operation in the sea especially in the bad weather like this <unk> said
but <unk> said his country will not give up or set a time limit for the operation
the search area is expanding with six zones added to the operation on tuesday sulistyo told reporters
now he said teams in the air on sea and on land are searching thirteen zones over an area that <unk> about one hundred and fifty six thousand square kilometers
airasia says air traffic controllers lost contact with the aircraft at seven twenty four a.m. sunday singapore time
the plane flying from the indonesian city of surabaya to singapore went missing as it flew over the java sea between the islands of <unk> and <unk> a heavily traveled shipping channel with shallow waters indonesian authorities said
before the plane an airbus a three hundred and twenty two hundred lost contact with air traffic controllers one of the pilots asked to change course and fly at a higher altitude because of bad weather officials said
heavy thunderstorms were reported in the area at the time
air traffic control approved the pilot's request to turn left but denied permission for the plane to climb to thirty eight thousand feet from thirty two thousand feet <unk> <unk> an aviation official at the indonesian transport ministry told the national newspaper <unk>
the increased altitude request was denied because there was another plane flying at that height he said
<unk> suggested that flight eight thousand five hundred and one ascended despite air traffic control denying it permission
airasia ceo tony fernandes said storm clouds caused the pilot to ask for a flight plan change
but he added we don't want to <unk> whether weather was a factor
we really don't know
once the aircraft is found there will be a proper investigation fernandes said

the <unk> airbus a three hundred and twenty that will take families from surabaya over the zone has room for as many as one hundred and eighty people he said
some police said authorities were seeking additional materials to help identify passengers such as photos with close ups of teeth dna or <unk>
but police officials later told cnn they were not immediately seeking these materials
east java police have set up a disaster victims identification area at the surabaya airport
of the people on board the passenger jet one hundred and fifty five are indonesian three are south korean one is british one is french one is malaysian and one is singaporean the airline said
eighteen children including one infant are among the passengers the carrier said
seven of the people on board are crew members
families of airasia flight passengers given support through the nightmare
since the flight disappeared in indonesian airspace indonesia is heading up search efforts
more than one thousand one hundred search and rescue personnel from australia singapore malaysia south korea japan and new zealand are joining the search alongside indonesia's teams cnn indonesia reported
the missing plane is made by airbus a french company
and france has <unk> two investigators to indonesia

china will <unk> aircraft and ships to participate in search and rescue efforts the chinese ministry of national defense said tuesday
airasia a successful budget airline group <unk> in malaysia had a clean safety record until the disappearance of flight eight thousand five hundred and one
the missing plane is operated by the company's indonesian affiliate
the loss of contact with the plane comes nearly ten months after the disappearance of malaysia airlines flight three hundred and seventy which dropped off radar over southeast asia on march eight with two hundred and thirty nine people on board
airasia and mh three hundred and seventy cases are very different
searchers have yet to find any remains of flight three hundred and seventy which officials believe went down in the southern indian ocean after <unk> flying thousands of kilometers away from its planned route from <unk> <unk> to beijing
but some aviation experts don't think the search for flight eight thousand five hundred and one will be as challenging as the hunt for mh three hundred and seventy
we are not talking about the deep indian ocean here cnn aviation correspondent richard quest said
we are talking about <unk> airspace around southeast asia
there will be much better radar coverage
there's certainly better air traffic control coverage
cnn's <unk> <unk> andrew <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> contributed to this report
<unk> <unk> also contributed to this report
editor's note
<unk> <unk> is a boeing seven hundred and seventy seven captain for a major airline with thirty years of flying experience
he is also a cnn aviation analyst and senior <unk> to flying magazine
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author
before the world <unk> a conclusion as to the outcome of airasia flight qz eight thousand five hundred and one it's important to understand that the details are far too limited for drawing a parallel to malaysia flight three hundred and seventy
<unk> that the airplane disappeared suggests it <unk> into thin air
at this point the airbus a three hundred and twenty has simply not been found but the search is in its <unk> compared with the months of searching since malaysia <unk> boeing seven hundred and seventy seven went missing in march
a crucial difference in the flight eight thousand five hundred and one event is that the airplane had been in constant radar contact at least from the information provided thus far
radar data from air traffic control can provide tracking data that will indicate the flight path altitude and direction the a three hundred and twenty two hundred followed
this will assist in more <unk> defining the search area
with malaysia three hundred and seventy radar data was <unk>
satellite data has been the primary source in <unk> the track and thus the search area
although it appears airasia eight thousand five hundred and one flew through a large area of <unk> weather this fact might have been a contributing cause and not the only cause of the event
no matter how obvious it might appear airplane incidents and accidents generally involve more than one factor
any good accident investigator will tell you that it is important not to focus on one theory until all the facts have been <unk>
so what could have occurred
no doubt the crew was attempting to <unk> <unk> cells through the use of sophisticated on board weather radar
on occasion <unk> around storm activity becomes a matter of <unk> the path that has a lower probability of <unk> encounters
airline pilots always attempt complete <unk> <unk> a wide <unk> around thunderstorms
unfortunately route restrictions other aircraft traffic and altitude <unk> sometimes prevent our flights from <unk> as far as <unk> like
this isn't to say we <unk> safety only that we might not be able to provide the most comfortable conditions for flying
experience <unk> much of the decision process that airline pilots use to <unk> around <unk> weather
operation of the radar itself can be an art with respect to <unk> the <unk> angle and intensity the <unk> reflects on the display screen
although <unk> are <unk> designed to <unk> <unk> <unk> flight into a <unk> is never an option
and let's not be <unk> by the reported request of flight eight thousand five hundred and one asking air traffic control for a higher altitude
this request may not have been an indication of a problem
<unk> a request for a higher altitude is to provide a <unk> ride
yes it is possible to top a <unk> cell but most airline pilots attempt to turn away from the weather because <unk> can still be <unk> above a building storm cell
but there may be other contributing factors to the possible loss of airasia flight eight thousand five hundred and one
investigators will want to know whether the <unk> <unk> that provide <unk> data to the cockpit computer systems <unk> as a result of a <unk> failure similar to the circumstances with air france flight four hundred and forty seven
erroneous <unk> data would send confusing information to the <unk> panel displays
because of the confusing information pilots would have difficulty <unk>
it is also possible that the airplane flew through heavy <unk> <unk> out both engines
although the a three hundred and twenty is designed to continue flying without engine power being able to control it at high altitude would be a challenge especially in turbulent conditions
if the airplane flew to the limits of its capabilities in regard to altitude the difference between maximum <unk> and its lowest <unk> would have been a very small <unk>
perhaps a high altitude stall occurred and the airplane never recovered
regardless of any speculation it is much too early for theories
for the moment i am keeping my fingers crossed that a search and rescue operation will find survivors
bigger <unk> have occurred
in the end at least ten people died the italian coast guard said on monday
but many more were saved four hundred and twenty seven the coast guard said
<unk> <unk> was one of those who survived
we were <unk> and cold and the rain was like <unk> she said
there was always these explosions and this feeling you have in your feet
it goes through your body

it was <unk> but i knew it is so real
this was really bad to really know it is real
the italian coast guard earlier said that all remaining passengers had been evacuated from the vessel with the <unk> commander finally leaving the ship at two fifty p.m. monday
the coast guard said it was <unk> the ship and <unk> how to transport it and where
the public prosecutor in <unk> italy said he had requested the <unk> of the ship as part of a criminal investigation
authorities are waiting for <unk> from <unk> officials to release the ship because it is in <unk> waters

no charges have been filed
more than four hundred passengers were traveling on the norman atlantic between the greek port of <unk> and the italian port of <unk> when the fire began apparently in the <unk> parking bay

photos showed survivors wrapped in emergency <unk> blankets being carried away on <unk>
one man died after he jumped or fell into the cold water authorities said
it is unclear how the other victims died
dramatic cell phone images <unk> by a passenger showed flames through shattered <unk> while a wider view released by rescuers showed a huge <unk> of thick black smoke streaming from the <unk> vessel
many passengers were unable to reach the lower <unk> because of the heat and the water below was so cold that jumping clear of the ferry was not an option
sea surface temperatures had been around fourteen to fifteen degrees celsius cnn meteorologist tom <unk> said which would have limited the survival time in the water to six hours at most
passengers told greek and italian <unk> they had felt like prisoners on a burning ship
it's not known how the fire started but it is believed to have <unk> in the parking bay
a truck driver told the greek news media that trucks filled with oil were packed like <unk> their cargo <unk> the ceiling which could have set off <unk> in rough seas to start a fire he <unk>

<unk> high court ruled friday doctors can withdraw life support in the case of a <unk> dead woman who is eighteen weeks pregnant as there is no reasonable prospect her unborn child will survive
the court earlier this week heard the woman's family had appealed for her treatment to be stopped saying they wanted her to die with dignity
however doctors refused to turn off the life support machine as they were concerned about the rights of the unborn child
under the <unk> constitution the unborn have the same right to life as the mother
abortion is illegal except in cases where the <unk> life is at real and substantial risk due to medical <unk> or the threat of suicide
the woman in her twenty s with two other children was put on life support on december three when she was pronounced <unk> dead after suffering serious brain trauma
a panel of three high court judges ruled friday the life support can be <unk>
they found the medical evidence in the case shows the prospects for a successful delivery of a live baby are virtually <unk>
justice nicholas <unk> announced the decision
he said
to maintain and continue the present <unk> support for the mother would <unk> her of dignity in death
it would subject her father her partner and her young children to <unk> distress in a <unk> exercise which <unk> only because of fears held by medical specialists of potential legal consequences
<unk> continued
highly experienced medical <unk> with the best interests of both mother and unborn child in mind do not believe there is any medical or <unk> based reason for continuing with a process described as <unk> on the <unk>
the court is therefore <unk> in the circumstances of this case that in the best interest of the unborn child it should <unk> at the <unk> of the medical team the withdrawal of ongoing <unk> support being provided for in this tragic and unfortunate case

editor's note
fareed zakaria is the host of cnn's global public square
this column was <unk> from <unk> a gps special <unk> at ten a.m. and one p.m
et sunday on cnn
the views expressed are his own
<unk> are exciting inspiring
but they are also expensive and not all of them work out like apollo eleven
so are they worth it
should we focus time money and energy on these kinds of ambitious scientific projects
the answer is yes
think of it this way
imagine that the apollo moon landing had not succeeded
would it still have been worth it
almost certainly
after all the challenge of getting to the moon and back meant coming up with all kinds of technological innovations and solutions that have then had almost <unk> commercial applications
for example apollo needed small computers for its trip
so nasa says it made a big purchase of a relatively new technology the integrated circuit the technology behind what we now know as the <unk>
the companies that <unk> this product <unk> such as <unk> <unk> whose <unk> founded <unk> partly had nasa to thank the agency says for the popularity of the technology that followed
the u.s. government by buying the initial products helped the computer revolution take off
and it's not just the <unk>
gps technology which is now <unk> the next phase of the information revolution was originally developed by the u.s. military
but it was only after the one thousand nine hundred and eighty three soviet shooting down of a korean air lines flight that the <unk> administration said it would share the technology so that civilian airplanes would not <unk> into restricted and dangerous territories
and it was only after the cold war ended that the clinton administration opened up the technology fully to commercial applications which of course <unk> a flood of innovation that continues to this day
or consider the <unk> of the human <unk>
according to the <unk> memorial institute the federal government spent three point eight billion dollar on the massive project from one thousand nine hundred and ninety to two thousand and three an amount few other <unk> could ever have <unk>
but in leading the way it encouraged others and now a person's dna can be <unk> for as little as one thousand dollar
the impact on the economy of human <unk> <unk> from one thousand nine hundred and eighty eight to two thousand and ten was estimated by <unk> at almost eight hundred billion dollar enough to support more than three hundred and ten thousand jobs in two thousand and ten alone
reading all this you might think the united states is on the right track
<unk> the problem is it is not
federal funding for research and development has barely been keeping up with inflation in recent years if you look at the numbers from the national science foundation
since big <unk> such as social security are <unk> spending programs it is <unk> spending such as science that often <unk> the <unk> of the budget <unk>
and this cutting comes at a time when others around the world are moving fast
the united states has dominated the world of basic science for years even decades
but recently its share of global research and development has been falling from thirty seven percents of the total in two thousand and one to thirty percents in two thousand and eleven according to the national science foundation
as scientist <unk> <unk> points out china is on course to <unk> the united states in the <unk> of its gross domestic product it <unk> on research and development in just a few years
it used to be that funding basic science was not a <unk> issue
as <unk> notes a certain rock <unk> republican was a big <unk> of basic research
<unk> said in a one thousand nine hundred and eighty eight radio address
the remarkable thing is that although basic research does not begin with a particular practical goal when you look at the results over the years it ends up being one of the most practical things government does
this is why i've urged congress to <unk> more money to research
it is an <unk> investment in america's future
americans used to understand that <unk> inspire us but that they also power america's future
let's hope that today's politicians follow <unk> advice and invest in science research and development

young said while capa drew <unk> for his action photos those he took at the battle of the <unk> are of a different nature
the images of dead soldiers a farmer <unk> a dead horse in the snow and german prisoners <unk> with their hands raised <unk> to the <unk> of this deadly campaign young said
capa who young describes as decidedly anti <unk> was not an <unk> <unk> of the war but rather an official allied photographer
he photographed for the american and english press to <unk> readers of the war in the hope that his photographs would help garner allied support young said
you'll see several photos of german prisoners in the accompanying gallery
young said that capa would only photograph german soldiers if they were prisoners
despite <unk> allied status he cast anything but a military appearance according to <unk> koyen a u.s. army public relations officer who assisted capa during the battle of the <unk>
writing in the history of photography koyen <unk> how that appearance almost cost capa his freedom when koyen <unk> capa into a u.s. army intelligence headquarters where an intelligence officer lt. col. harry brown was working on a wall mounted map of battle positions
arrest that man
get him out of here
brown shouted as he tried to <unk> the map from capa who was wearing a <unk> german <unk> <unk> according to <unk> account
koyen was able to convince the <unk> of <unk> allegiance but the <unk> appearance almost cost him again later in the battle when u.s. soldiers began shooting at capa koyen wrote
koyen stepped in and waved the <unk> off he wrote
and then
capa and i exchanged a long glance
without a word he took off the <unk> <unk> and <unk> it in the
those <unk> were among the one million soldiers who fought in the battle of the <unk>
more than one hundred thousand germans and sixty seven thousand americans were casualties according to the national <unk> ii museum
the battle was considered finished on january twenty eight one thousand nine hundred and forty five when german forces were pushed back to positions they occupied when their offensive began six weeks earlier

neither sony or <unk> which own playstation and xbox respectively have had much to say about the <unk> that have kept millions of its gamers from playing one another online but there were signs friday evening that it may soon be resolved
at two sixteen a.m friday <unk> verified <unk> account tweeted some xbox one users may currently be <unk> issues signing into xbox live and directed users to its service website for the latest
sony's official playstation support twitter account posted at two thirty a.m
et our engineers are continuing to work hard to resolve the network issues users have experienced today
thanks for your continued patience
more than fourteen hours later at five ten p.m it tweeted pretty much the same thing
update
we are working to restore full network services for all platforms thanks as always for your patience
but based on the overall sentiment expressed in the comments posted to message <unk> and on twitter the collective patience among playstation users is <unk> as well

i'm getting rid of this piece of trash and going back too <unk> <unk> gaming
totally not cool <unk> said late friday morning
i've tried so many times and am unable to play
some users talked of a possible hack
this is so <unk> wrote <unk> seventy five
the hackers think they're hurting sony but the ones that really pay for this <unk> <unk> are the innocent users
if it turns out that this was indeed a cyberattack chances are it was done by <unk> squad a band of black <unk> hackers who have claimed responsibility
cnn can not confirm the identity or claims of the group and playstation hasn't said anything beyond that it was working to fix the problem
for its part xbox spokesman <unk> <unk> told cnn that we don't share <unk> on the root cause of specific issues
but there is little reason to doubt their claims
in august <unk> squad said it took down the playstation network by flooding it with <unk> traffic something called a distributed denial of service attack in the video game world resulting in millions of gamers being unable to play together online
as <unk> reported at the time when john <unk> president of sony online entertainment tweeted about those large scale attacks he became a target himself even at thirty thousand feet
we have been receiving reports that <unk> plane three hundred and sixty two from <unk> to san has explosives on board please look into this the group tweeted to american airlines resulting in the flight being diverted
earlier this month sony was hit with a similar outage that <unk> squad not only took credit for but it promised additional christmas presents would soon be coming
unlike santa we don't like giving all of our christmas presents out on one day
this entire month will be <unk> <unk> squad tweeted
at six thirteen p.m. friday a <unk> squad twitter handle tweeted all attacks on <unk> and xbox have stopped
when a cnn reporter hit <unk> moments later on the sony entertainment network website which had been down since thursday evening it was back online
<unk> service page was still reporting limited service however
the network <unk> started just hours after <unk> xbox video store started to stream the seth rogen comedy the interview
the movie was made by sony pictures a <unk> of sony's playstation division
sony was the victim of a massive cyberattack in late november that was widely believed to be motivated at least in part by north korea's anger over the interview which <unk> the assassination of the country's leader kim jong un
but there was no indication that thursday's problems were in any way connected to the <unk> digital release
other participating <unk> of the movie such as youtube were <unk>
and playstation is not participating in the release

vladimir putin delivered a <unk> of coal in the <unk> <unk> this year when he announced thursday that he has canceled holiday <unk> for members of the government
russia's president delivered the bad news at a december twenty five meeting he <unk> of his government but for those thinking that his timing was merely the <unk> <unk> of a <unk> <unk> christmas is celebrated in russia on january seven the traditional date in the eastern orthodox church
the government and its various structures can not afford such extensive holidays at least not this year putin told government ministers in a speech broadcast on state television
you know what i am talking about
he was talking about russia's battered economy
we have been making efforts to change the structure of our economy to <unk> it and make it more innovative
quite a lot has been done in this direction he said
however recent events show that this is not enough
it was a change in tone from just a week ago when putin largely blamed the west for russia's <unk> even suggesting a u.s. saudi conspiracy theory to bring down oil prices at his annual press conference
at thursday's meeting however the president admitted at least some fault
the <unk> we have come across are not only of an external type
they are not only due to some sanctions or <unk> caused by the global market situation they are also the result of our own <unk> that have <unk> up over the years
so now people will go to the movie when it opens christmas day in the u.s. and then perhaps everyone can judge the <unk> of this massive incident but let's take a moment to speak for the only <unk> not represented in the viral debate
the film is about journalists yes
ok let's see what this might do for to journalists then
sony chairman michael <unk> said this about the film to cnn
first of all we made the movie because it was because we thought it was a funny comedy
<unk> there is a long history of political satire in film
and this clearly falls into that <unk>
and michael who had run <unk> books after the one thousand nine hundred and <unk> salman <unk> affair when iranian <unk> condemned <unk> to death for writing the <unk> <unk> admitted that sony's originally pulling the interview from theaters was a blow to freedom of expression which is <unk> dear and protected under the u.s. constitution
and after declaring pyongyang was in fact behind the massive attack president barack obama <unk> in about setting a dangerous <unk>
we can not have a society in which some <unk> <unk> can start imposing censorship here in the united states obama said
imagine what they start doing once they see a documentary that they don't like or news reports that they don't like
absolutely right
and that's where we journalists come in
because after all the <unk> <unk> <unk> about process corporate <unk> legal <unk> constitutional rights letting terrorists set the agenda let's talk a little about content
let's in fact spare a thought for our <unk> <unk> working away out there in the united states and around the world
david <unk> media writer for the new york times said this about the <unk> content
while i am all for <unk> creative choices was it really important that the head being blown up in a comedy about <unk> <unk> be that of an actual sitting ruler of a <unk> state
if you want to <unk> a <unk> leader there are plenty of ways to skin that cat as charlie <unk> demonstrated with the great dictator which <unk> hitler in everything but name
yes and
what about those <unk> <unk>
they're journalists right
or meant to be
and what message will that send to every <unk> out dictator from another planet <unk> control <unk> <unk> posing as president
not to mention crazy extremist throat <unk> militant terrorists
i don't want to <unk> the discussion party about satire comedy freedom of expression <unk>
but i can tell you from personal experience the above mentioned already think we are velvet <unk> at best or cia agents military spies
and yes would be <unk>
one of the most <unk> acts of <unk> murder was the killing of legendary afghan freedom fighter ahmad shah <unk> just days before nine eleven
imagine two terrorists posing as journalist and <unk> get the interview
they are in fact <unk> up suicide bombers
no one thought to check them and the rest is history
in iran thirty five journalists are in jail on <unk> charges including iranian american <unk> <unk> of the washington post
his mother told me the family has heard that a closed trial condemned him on espionage related charges
it's <unk> of course but this is what journalists have to endure
the iranian government seems to believe all these people are regime change agents through cultural <unk>
they are terrified of a so called velvet revolution and color <unk> ever since they put down the green movement after the disputed two thousand and nine elections
journalists were swept up in a <unk> forced to <unk> on iranian state tv before being tried and sentenced to the <unk> <unk> prison
check out <unk> <unk> excellent <unk> movie <unk> on the case of british iranian journalist <unk> <unk>
it's a <unk> <unk> of the ridiculous <unk> dark reality of what it takes to be a journalist in iran and other countries
in russia <unk> journalists not to mention anyone who <unk> looks <unk> at putin can feel the <unk> of the system
some are arrested some worse
anyone remember reporter <unk> <unk> shot point blank in her moscow apartment building in two thousand and six
a <unk> critic of the kremlin and author of <unk> russia she was working on a series of reports about human rights abuses in <unk> at the time of her death
and by the way facebook this week <unk> in to the russian government's demand that a site for opposition politician <unk> navalny be taken down
he's under house arrest
<unk>
i didn't hear a <unk> of sony rage about this serious damage to freedom of expression
terrible year for journalists in the middle east
over the years in these and many other countries the number of journalists killed injured arrested and just <unk> shut up has <unk> and continues its horrible <unk> <unk>
finally this year spare a thought for the victims of the <unk> of today's middle east
journalists james foley and steven sotloff aid workers alan <unk> and peter kassig were <unk> up in guantanamo colors and forced to <unk> before their <unk> were <unk> so wide their heads came off
before their execution they were forced to <unk> their families and their flags
they were forced to admit to false charges of <unk> and plotting
they were forced to give up their very dignity before they were forced to give up their lives
as i say the interview might be very funny
i just wish it weren't yet more <unk> for the <unk> who see all journalists as their <unk> enemy
we haven't mentioned what north korea does to <unk> journalists
their own prisoners get labor camps torture and <unk> <unk> if they're not executed
foreigners get traded for a whole <unk> of <unk> and who knows what else
but i bet journalist <unk> <unk> is probably pleased her <unk> prison ordeal there began and ended before this film was released
and <unk> i can <unk> you our colleagues who have been so <unk> killed and imprisoned this year and every year were certainly not the easily <unk> members of the american press who choose gossip type that west wing and newsroom creator <unk> <unk> <unk> against in his sony rage last week
the wishes of the terrorists were fulfilled in part by easily <unk> members of the american press who chose gossip and <unk> fueled reporting over a story with <unk> consequences for the public a story that was developing right in front of their eyes <unk> said in a statement
no the ones we lost this year were brilliant brave and full of heart daring to keep doing the dangerous job of bringing you the truth
may they rest in peace

tiger woods says it is an incredible relief to be over his injury problems and is now <unk> on adding to his fourteen major <unk> next year
woods who turns thirty nine on december thirty failed to make the cut at the u.s. <unk> in august after struggling to <unk> full <unk> following surgery on a <unk> <unk> in his back earlier in the year
the u.s. star made a return to action earlier in december at the hero world challenge the tournament he hosts every year at his home course of <unk> in florida
but the former world number one was unable to finish after being physically ill during his third round leaving him joint last
writing on his end of year blog woods said
i'm mostly excited about being healthy again
i've struggled for the past year and half with my back and it showed in my results
even though i won five times two years ago it was hit or miss some weeks and got <unk> worse
now that it feels healthy strong and stable it's fun to be able to play with my kids again to play soccer and run around with them shoot <unk>
things that i used to do and took for granted
for anybody who has ever had a bad back with <unk> damage it's <unk> debilitating
to not feel that is finally just incredible relief
woods who won the last of his major <unk> in two thousand and eight will spend the holiday season with his children and partner <unk> vonn
ski star vonn who missed out on <unk> the all time record for the number of world cup race <unk> last weekend has had injury problems of her own
vonn was forced to undergo knee surgery earlier this year and missed out on defending her olympic downhill crown at the <unk> olympics
speaking to cnn earlier this year vonn revealed how woods had played a key role in helping her through a difficult time when he too was struggling for <unk>
tiger and i both went through <unk> with our injuries at a similar time so we were both in the <unk> together and pushing each other and <unk> each other both frustrated vonn told cnn's <unk> edge last month
i think we both helped each other a lot through that time and i drew a lot of inspiration from him and i think he does the same with me
we continue to push each other and it's a really positive relationship in that way
some call makoko the <unk> of africa
but while the intricate <unk> may <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> italian city living conditions could hardly be more <unk>
makeshift houses with <unk> iron <unk> balance <unk> atop <unk>
down below narrow wooden boats act as a form of <unk> taxi <unk> goods and people around the <unk> community
nobody knows the exact population of this slum district of <unk> but it is estimated to be as high as one hundred thousand
what's sure is that few tourists will come here to take a romantic <unk> trip beneath the night sky <unk> <unk> off the water onto <unk> <unk>
there is little by the way of a <unk> system meaning all sorts of <unk> <unk> are sure to <unk> the <unk>
on top of that law enforcement agencies rarely enter the slum with security left to groups of young men known locally as the area boys
for photographer <unk> afose however the <unk> waters of makoko have always been home
the aspiring twenty four year old was born raised and continues to live in this chaotic floating district
as such it is one of the subjects he feels most comfortable turning his ever more popular <unk> on
i started my photography here in makoko afose told cnn when we meet at the <unk> surrounds of the two thousand and fourteen <unk> photo festival
it's really inspiring
i've been able to get a lot of inspiration in terms of seeing a lot of things in my community he added
<unk> career has really begun to take off in recent years
after learning his craft in workshops put on by the african artists foundation he went on to study <unk> at the nigerian institute of journalism
he's since had photos <unk> at various national arts and photography festivals as well as <unk> in numerous international magazines and <unk>
afose has even worked alongside the respected spanish photographer <unk> de <unk>
happy to see some of my work published he said
and to see the fact of my name written on the pictures is something very great
yet despite the international recognition its the daily <unk> and <unk> of makoko that continues to inspire afose
he explains that his knowledge of the local customs attitudes and the people who live there gives him an edge over those who may come from outside to document life in the community
to tell the story with this you have to know who this guy is
just by looking at him is he happy or is he not happy
you have to try to know what it is all about
you can't just pick up your camera and start shooting he said
here and now
then there's the skill vital for any photojournalist to develop the <unk> <unk> of being in the right place at the right time
afose was rapidly on the spot when a fire that <unk> through part of makoko in two thousand and thirteen
the scenes were horrific but the images afose captured told the story and brought some of the harsh <unk> of life in the slum to the outside world
they appeared in numerous <unk> in print and online
the fire was caused by a <unk> and it burned a lot of houses in the community afose explained
i had the opportunity to get there at the right time and try document what the scene was all about what caused the scene what caused the fire outbreak he added
it is likely the makoko fire wouldn't have <unk> as much attention in the national and international press without <unk> timely and <unk> images
the experience has made him even more aware of the importance of having local people tell the story of the community there
so much so that it has inspired him on to his next challenge
i want to go further i want to know more he said
when pushed on what this means he added you know maybe having a university degree come back to the community and teach people
to become what i am today
maybe then the outside world will be able to appreciate even more of life in makoko through the sharp shooting eyes of its residents
professional travel <unk> are like <unk> old movie critics once they've done enough traveling dining and <unk> they can become weary and entitled taking for granted the <unk> that <unk> <unk> turn down service or <unk> bread <unk>
that's partly why user reviews on sites like tripadvisor <unk> and google plus local have become so useful
but user reviews too have their <unk>

<unk> <unk> the legendary <unk> state football coach once <unk> of throwing the ball there are three things that can happen when you pass and two of them <unk> good

whether it's anger over a <unk> product or service <unk> competition or a <unk> former employee this makes the user less a reviewer than a <unk>
a <unk> if you will
nothing good to say
there's almost always something good that can be said about terrible things and any reviewer who can't <unk> one is probably still working out high school <unk>
legitimate <unk> about environmental noise or area safety can be helpful

nothing bad to say
the sound from a <unk> is the result of <unk> <unk> in its production
there's almost always a hole that can be punched in even the most perfect things and any reviewer who can't <unk> one isn't sharing the same reality most of the rest of us live in
experiences no one else will have
it's truly <unk> that management took such great care of you
but <unk> the desk <unk> is from my same village in <unk> so he <unk> us from a supply <unk> to a twenty four room <unk>

take a five star tripadvisor review of the uk's <unk> <unk> restaurant titled nineteen <unk> ago had a <unk> here and gave birth that same evening
<unk>
unless this observation actually is <unk> in which case this restaurant too is to be avoided at all cost
according to a harvard study sixteen percents of <unk> restaurant reviews are fake
it's the <unk> only review
contribution counts beside each tripadvisor and <unk> review <unk> at whether a user is being <unk> or just popping in to <unk> up a business
in their <unk> to <unk> up the garden variety <unk> of real <unk> <unk> use <unk> ad speak words like <unk> <unk> <unk> mouth <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
a <unk> study found that fake reviews center more on first person <unk> like details about a travel partner and reasons for a trip
real reviews focus on specifics like bathroom size and <unk> because they're <unk> and useful
it's not often someone <unk> to getting <unk> for their reviews but it sure is <unk> when they do
magic smile one of the businesses <unk> by the new york state attorney <unk> office in its investigation of fake <unk> reviews features this <unk> <unk>

the most <unk> of all <unk> yes even more than profit is that of the user who <unk> a kind of online celebrity from the number of reviews they've written
the <unk> s. <unk> of tripadvisor power users often make their reviews about themselves

we're not talking the <unk> here

in the early centuries of <unk> existence there was no consensus on the date of jesus birth or even on whether the day whatever it was should be celebrated as a holiday
<unk> <unk> writing in christianity today notes that early christians <unk> that the date was <unk> may twenty april eighteen april nineteen may twenty eight january two november seventeen november twenty march twelve and march twenty five and that december twenty five probably didn't emerge as the <unk> date until late in the third century
that <unk> or not <unk> the new christmas onto the old <unk> the most popular celebration of roman times
the seven day festival that started december seventeen to honor the god <unk> and welcome the winter <unk> gave us today's tradition of holiday <unk> gift giving and the office party for the <unk> was a time of much drinking some <unk> certainly <unk> <unk>
the <unk> and yang of that has come down to us through the centuries and can be seen today in the battles over the <unk> of christmas the popularity of <unk> parties too many <unk> <unk> the voices raised in song
a little too much god rest <unk> merry <unk> and not enough o holy night
having enjoyed <unk> merry and happy <unk> through the years as i was growing up and making my way in the world i took those concerns in <unk> and kept ho

at the ready
then in my early forty s when i was living in new england while <unk> through a book as part of my research for a story i hit the <unk>
christmas under the ban
because it happened to be facing a page with an old <unk> illustration of a little girl standing under a living room <unk> <unk> with <unk> i thought the <unk> of <unk> was the ban
complaints about how to celebrate christmas had started early <unk> through the dark ages the middle ages and then came into their own in <unk> england
christmas in <unk> <unk> england was seen by the <unk> as a bit too merry
the holiday had come to be marked by <unk> beer and <unk> and other spirits <unk> in the <unk> on christmas eve <unk> crowds celebrating the <unk> of <unk>
come christmas morning <unk> like <unk> would march down the <unk> in churches where services were being held
unable to <unk> in the <unk> the <unk> turned their back on christmas altogether
not just the celebrations and traditions christmas day itself
it would be just another day
their no christmas policy no way no how <unk> <unk> e <unk> e <unk> crossed the atlantic with them on the <unk>
when the <unk> landed at <unk> in december one thousand six hundred and twenty they observed the <unk> on sunday but come christmas day went <unk> to work
back in england when the <unk> came to power under <unk> a <unk> was issued in one thousand six hundred and fifty two <unk> that stores should remain open on december twenty five
in new england such a law was <unk> on the books in boston <unk> <unk> by the <unk> of the massachusetts bay <unk> on may eleven one thousand six hundred and fifty nine and not <unk> until one thousand six hundred and eighty one
but christmas had its appeal
the rev
increase <unk> felt it necessary to address its <unk> in one thousand six hundred and eighty seven
the <unk> of christmas <unk> observe that festival after such a manner as is highly <unk> to the name of christ
how few are there <unk> that spend those holidays after an holy manner
but they are consumed in <unk> in <unk> in playing at cards in <unk> in excess of wine in mad <unk>
will christ the holy son of god be pleased with such services
in one thousand seven hundred and eleven the rev
<unk> <unk> like father like son <unk> against the holiday <unk>
i hear of a number of young people of both <unk> he wrote belonging many of them to my <unk> who have had on the <unk> this last week a <unk> a <unk> <unk> and ball which <unk> their corruption and has a <unk> to corrupt them yet more
it wasn't just the <unk> in their <unk> keeping a <unk> eye out for signs of christmas
judge samuel <unk> who kept a <unk> that has given historians a rare look at daily life in boston in the eighteen th century has numerous <unk> <unk> expressing his <unk> at the sight of people going about their regular daily business on christmas day equally <unk> of any signs of awareness or recognition much less celebration of christmas
a one thousand six hundred and ninety seven entry
<unk> twenty five
ninety seven
<unk> day
shops are open and <unk> and <unk> come to town with wood and <unk> as <unk> save what <unk> may be allowed on account of the weather
the <unk> were so vigilant <unk> for the <unk> sign of keeping christmas because they saw any <unk> as the first step toward falling back under the <unk> of the church of england from which they'd fled
and anyone who kept christmas became an <unk> literally or <unk>
the tide started to turn in the late eighteen th century
the first waves of immigration to <unk> at the new england shores like the flood tide that would come in the nineteen th century tended to be from countries that observed christmas
not to be <unk> in its importance to the holiday the <unk> of the u.s. constitution removed the fear of falling back under the <unk> of the church of england when it <unk> no establishment of a state religion in fact proclaimed a <unk> of church and state
but the <unk> hold on new england was strong
as late as one thousand eight hundred and fifty six december twenty five was a common <unk> in boston and those who refused to go to work on christmas day were often dismissed
some factory owners would even change the starting hours on christmas day to five a.m. workers who wanted to attend church services would either have to <unk> them or be dismissed for being late to work
opinion
where christmas really came from
henry <unk> <unk> wrote in a journal entry dated december twenty five one thousand eight hundred and fifty six
not a very merry christmas
we are in a transition state about christmas here in new england
the old <unk> feeling <unk> it from being a <unk> <unk> holiday though every year makes it more so
across the <unk> charles <unk> a christmas <unk> published december nineteen one thousand eight hundred and forty three was <unk> the centuries old war over christmas the two sides clearly shown battle lines drawn in the opening pages when <unk> nephew drops by
don't be cross uncle
said the nephew
what else can i be returned the uncle when i live in such a world of <unk> as this
merry christmas
out upon merry christmas
if i could work my will said <unk> <unk> every idiot who goes about with merry christmas on his <unk> should be <unk> with his own <unk> and buried with a stake of <unk> through his heart
he should
nephew returned the uncle <unk> keep christmas in your own way and let me keep it in mine
keep it
repeated <unk> nephew
but you don't keep it
that of course was before the visits from the <unk> of christmas past present and yet to come that <unk> the one hundred and eighty degree turn in <unk> that with the help of the <unk> and tiny <unk> gave us the christmas we know and love today
but pockets of resistance <unk> in boston
in the early one thousand nine hundred s a <unk> from virginia where christmas was celebrated married a man from boston where it was touch and go and they settled into a place on <unk> hill
as christmas drew <unk> she asked around for a group that went <unk> and found there was none
thinking to start one she found a problem
as the <unk> put it when they declined
someone might hear us
as late as the one thousand nine hundred and thirty s some churches in boston would be closed a printed notice on the doors saying there would be no services christmas day
today the old <unk> concerns have been reduced to <unk> <unk> about the <unk> of christmas and the <unk> aspect of the good cheer
while the old <unk> and the <unk> songs by such <unk> as <unk> berlin can be heard in malls large and small <unk> with the <unk> of the <unk> at the <unk> army collection <unk> or on the radio
if white christmas is the best known of the <unk> songs the one that <unk> how much christmas has come to mean to us may be the one that came out soon after when millions of world war ii <unk> were still overseas i'll be home for christmas
the <unk> added to the <unk>
you can plan on me
please have snow and <unk>
and presents on the tree
remember it's a wonderful life ends when george <unk> brother who has been away in the service <unk> home christmas eve joining the family and friends around the christmas tree in time to hear the <unk> ring when <unk> the <unk> <unk> gets his wings

<unk> tomar has worked hard for her shot at fame
from humble <unk> in rural india the thirty one year old has <unk> down the barrel of poverty and <unk> to become one of the world's leading <unk> <unk>
tomar made history in two thousand and ten when she became the first indian woman to win a world cup <unk> and has collected dozens of <unk> shooting <unk> over the years
two <unk> at the asian shotgun <unk> held in the united arab emirates last month were the latest <unk> in <unk> <unk> shooting career which began in the decidedly less <unk> <unk> of <unk> a provincial village fifty km north of new delhi
with around five thousand five hundred <unk> and a local economy based around agriculture villagers have been more used to wielding <unk> than <unk> and air <unk> but <unk> fortunes and others were transformed when a shooting range was set up in the late one thousand nine hundred and ninety s
from the beginning i was always interested in sports but there were no facilities in the village tomar told cnn's human to hero series
but then a local doctor who used to work in new delhi came and built a small shooting range
the <unk> rifle club is a modest affair with a ten meter range and a handful of shooting <unk>
there's also limited electricity so practice can only take place during the day
but these <unk> facilities have changed lives says tomar
when people got to know that a shooting range has opened in the village families realized that rather than the kids roaming free in the village they could get involved in this activity
it had a huge effect she says
along with producing a string of champion <unk> the range has also given villagers access to careers outside farming with many finding work with the indian army and local police forces
for tomar though the prospects of joining their number initially looked <unk> she was approaching <unk> and expected to get married and become a <unk>
i spoke to my mother and father asking them if i could do shooting
looking at the culture and society of the village they said it is not possible
it hurt me a lot and i felt really bad tomar said
i realized that until the time someone from my family most likely an elder would go into shooting my family would not let me enter the sport
so when her mother had a go attitudes towards the teenage <unk> participation changed
my mother was sixty years old when she started shooting and participated in air <unk> and air rifle
she won medals at state level then she played pre nationals and nationals and won medals there too
like her mother <unk> tomar <unk> out using an air <unk> but soon switched to a bigger weapon
i in air rifle for two years and my score was good
three hundred and ninety four hundred
but i thought i needed some other event she said
when i saw the shotgun event for the first time i liked it
it was a very explosive event
my results was quite good in it and i won a lot of medals
tomar enrolled in the indian army in two thousand and four and has been on india's shooting team since two thousand and five winning thirty two gold medals at national level and five <unk> and one silver on the international stage
her <unk> <unk> shooting involves hitting a series of moving targets from a distance of around seventy five meters using a twelve <unk> shotgun
when tomar <unk> her historic silver <unk> at the world cup in two thousand and ten she scored a personal best seventy out of seventy five a mark she <unk> by two points at the recent asian shotgun <unk> during the women's team event
the physical aspects of her sport are <unk> there is a lot of <unk> in the gun she says but to shoot well requires a clear mind as much as a steady hand
the most important is mental <unk> she says
the best thing is music
i love listening to music
before every match i listen to a good song and keep <unk> it
that is the best way to let go of all my mental stress
<unk> i miss the target or i get under pressure then i say no let's sing a song
that song keeps playing in my head
the benefit of the song playing in my head is that i leave the pressure and the match becomes better because of it she <unk>
with her mother still enjoying her shooting well into her seventy s tomar could be around at the top of her sport for decades to come
but for now the <unk> are on some important targets just around the corner like <unk> for the rio olympics in two thousand and sixteen
with a maximum of thirty places available for each competing country and two people per event tomar will need to be at the top of her game next season when the <unk> places are earned at world cup events and world and <unk> <unk>
medals and <unk> are clearly important to tomar but so are the <unk> of equality she has helped foster through her success promoting a message to girls in her village and across india that they too can be the masters of their own <unk>
i remember my older times when i would come to this shooting range nervous and shy
i used to think will i be able to do anything will people ever get to know me
all those things of the past i remember
now i feel really good and people know that and if girls are coming here for shooting they have achieved something
i love the feeling that many girls have come out of their house

there are many different models of peer to peer lending but essentially p two p websites let businesses <unk> money directly from individuals without going through a traditional financial institution such as a bank
funding circle has five thousand five hundred businesses registered and has lent more than three hundred million since it started
the company is <unk> massive growth
while banks still provide the majority of lending in the united kingdom over eighty five percents funding circle is confident it can seize a big <unk> of that
we look to take a large <unk> of that over the next five to ten years said <unk> jones a company spokeswoman
funding circle says the p two p business lending industry is <unk> in size every year and has the potential to be worth over twelve billion a year in the united kingdom in the next ten years according to research by <unk> a charity focused on innovative businesses and ideas

different p two p websites <unk> different levels of <unk> but funding circle said whether it's a small one off investment minimum <unk> or a large investment from a savvy <unk> the net return on average is about six point four percents after fees and bad debt are accounted for

there is a risk
it's an investment product not a savings product said jones
despite this many investors want to <unk> locally or support a particular industry or an ethical business and can do this easily in the p two p model she said

since the super bacteria are resistant to most modern <unk> doctors need to rely on drugs that are rarely used because they are toxic to the <unk>
earlier this year biologist mario <unk> described the <unk> gloria which will serve as a base for the sailing <unk> as a <unk>
while rio mayor <unk> <unk> admits a planned clean up will not be completed prior to the games state officials have <unk> fears over the risk to sailing competitors that take to the water
in a lengthy statement from the state environmental institute <unk> to cnn it said
according to the president of the institute <unk> <unk> the <unk> is not very resistant in the environment especially in salt water
there's no need to <unk>
the possibility of <unk> this bacteria in our beaches is <unk> almost non <unk> assured <unk> <unk> <unk> that there are no records of people contaminated with the bacteria outside of the hospital environment being admitted to rio de <unk> public hospitals
<unk> is a bacteria which loses its <unk> when it comes into contact with salt water
it's not an aggressive bacteria
it's only resistant to antibiotics
it only represents a risk to those people who have a weak <unk> system explained the specialist
as for rio two thousand and sixteen organizers they have been in contact both with the government and also the <unk> <unk> foundation
a spokesman for rio two thousand and sixteen told cnn
we were <unk> to a possible presence of <unk> type bacteria in some parts of the <unk> river
rio two thousand and sixteen created a task force regarding this matter
the group will continue to monitor the matter very closely and discuss with the government and with specialists the solutions to prevent <unk> of the water and continue to guarantee the safety of athletes
this issue does not impose any change in our planning for the test events and competition events

for decades he made an impressive career out of <unk> with great white sharks
the south african <unk> survived numerous encounters with these ocean <unk>
and when he needed to get closer to the animals taking the cage out of cage diving was a risk the <unk> <unk> was willing to take
but a debilitating stroke three years ago <unk> left the ex fisherman unable to get close to the sharks he came to love
today the closest he can get is through the tours of a local shark diving firm supreme sharks where he provides his expert knowledge for eager tourists
it's been eleven years since i last <unk> with a shark and i've love to get back into it again at a later stage hartman says
i'm not ready yet but i'm sure once i can swim properly i'll be there again
this passionate <unk> of the <unk> has spent years studying what many believe is one of the most dangerous <unk> in the world
i'm just <unk> by how they move and what they do and that <unk> me
they're like an <unk> they fly in the water
those wings <unk> with the weight of the body
born in <unk> cape town hartman has been a bit of <unk> ever since he was a child
by his teens he could often be found with his friends trying to catch <unk> with their bare hands
following <unk> the young risk taker <unk> from various jobs
finally after serving his <unk> national service in the army hartman found <unk>
the ancient and rather <unk> tradition of <unk> has been used for <unk> across the globe
it has also become a <unk> sport and hartman soon became one of the country's top <unk>
then one day in one thousand nine hundred and seventy seven during a seemingly normal practice dive hartman would have a close encounter that would change his life forever
he'd been diving for a few hours and was <unk> in his line when a sharp movement <unk> past him
thinking it was a <unk> of fish he tried to move around it and was confronted with a big black eye
it was a white shark my first white shark and i thought <unk> wait until i tell my friends he recalls
first white shark and it's huge
looks like a house next to me
once the initial shock and awe of the situation wore off hartman started to <unk> with the large <unk> pushing back as the shark came in a little too close for comfort
when he bit down on the gun i was <unk> from shock
i didn't expect it
and then it <unk> its mouth and i saw my hands go in
i thought <unk> oh and i jumped back to life and <unk> it out of his mouth
i put my <unk> on his eye meaning to <unk> his eye out and he just <unk> the gun out and <unk> down and <unk> away
after this dramatic confrontation hartman laid still for five minutes <unk> how he <unk> he would never dive again
but the decision didn't last too long
he adds
the next morning a <unk> calls <unk> are we going to dive some <unk> <unk> this afternoon
i said <unk> that's a good idea
in the late eighty s hartman began to see business opportunities from the big blue sea
shark tourism was booming and cage diving was quickly becoming a popular way of getting up close with the great <unk> off the coast
by one thousand nine hundred and ninety seven the savvy entrepreneur had started his own company taking eager <unk> to sea and <unk> them <unk> beneath the waves to meet the sharks at close range
within months the business began to take off and <unk> came <unk> at his door
the <unk> entrepreneur had found his <unk>
i became the guy if you want to film sharks go to <unk>
within two years they needed shots they couldn't get so i said jump in the water and we'll get it
because when you're in the cage with a camera it <unk> so i started taking people out of the cage
over the years <unk> reputation as one of south africa's leading shark experts has brought big opportunities and even the chance to join a film shoot in mexico
but then things took a turn for the worst
when i came back i actually had a stroke on my right hand side which <unk> me completely
refusing to let his stroke become a <unk> he began to fight back recovering quickly
but then three years ago hartman suffered another stroke this time it was too much and left him unable to swim with the sea creatures he <unk>
at the moment i'm just really starting to walk
but i still fall down every now and then
but i mean that happens he says
i've just got to get stronger
i'm walking short steps and it's going slowly
i mean the way i've lived my life if i have to do it again i'll do it exactly the same
watch the full show to find out more about <unk> exciting experiences of <unk> with great white sharks
countless christmas songs tell us that santa is basically the judge judy of <unk>
he <unk> who's been <unk> or nice and <unk> out presents or punishments <unk>
but historians say <unk> <unk> was originally created to keep adults not children off the <unk> list
being <unk> <unk> we <unk> <unk> surveillance turning the spotlight on kids and dramatically changing christmas celebrations
how did we achieve this very important historical victory
picture this
it's the early one thousand eight hundred s and america's christian leaders most of whom were <unk> <unk> types had banned religious celebrations of christmas as <unk> and <unk>
but people still wanted to party
because why not
it was <unk> the crops were <unk> and <unk> were waiting for better weather to <unk>
so on december twenty five working class <unk> got fall down <unk> and <unk> around cities looking for stuff to <unk>
imagine black friday spring break and new year's eve then <unk> them together like <unk> <unk> full of <unk>
that was christmas in the early one thousand eight hundred s
a bunch of blue blood new <unk> decided all this fun must stop
they wanted to <unk> christmas bring it <unk> and focus it on children says <unk> bowler author of santa claus
a history and professor of history at the university of <unk> in canada
these <unk> who formed the saint nicholas society of new york would change the world with two little <unk>
<unk>
<unk>
but let's back up for a minute
when the dutch came to the new world in the one thousand six hundred s they brought a fellow from <unk> named <unk> with them bowler says
<unk> who wore a red <unk> <unk> and a <unk> white beard was based on st. nicholas a three <unk> century greek who lived in modern day turkey
despite being a bishop this nick was a bit of a bad boy
an <unk> who dug up his bones in two thousand and five found that nicholas had a broken nose perhaps a result of the <unk> persecution of christians around that time said adam <unk> english author of the saint who would be santa claus
or could it have been christian on christian violence
according to one medieval legend nicholas punched a <unk> in the nose at the council of <unk> the meeting in three hundred and twenty five that formed the first consensus on christian <unk>
early <unk> of nicholas depict him without <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> that he had been <unk> possibly for <unk>
<unk> the nick at <unk> <unk> is not true said english
but people seem to love the story which <unk> up like <unk> on the internet this time of year
<unk> st. nicholas was known for more than <unk>
he also had a reputation for giving gifts and protecting children
the first quality comes from a story about a poor man with three young daughters
without a <unk> to offer <unk> the man worried that his daughters would fall into prostitution
legend has it that nicholas dropped three bags of gold through an open window in the man's house saving the women from the streets
the second story is a bit <unk>
while staying at an inn nicholas discovered three <unk> children in <unk> <unk>
he <unk> and <unk> the <unk> kids and punished the guilty <unk>
these <unk> along with his <unk> <unk> made nicholas the greatest male saint of the middle ages said bowler
one measure of his popularity is the <unk> list of people places churches and christian groups that list st. nick as their patron
bowler <unk> <unk> says that st. <unk> <unk> day december six was celebrated across europe for hundreds of years often by giving gifts to children
but beginning in the one thousand five hundred s the <unk> <unk> swept away the <unk> of christian <unk> <unk> them as <unk> and <unk>
christmas too went pretty much by the <unk> for much of <unk> europe during this time
some countries though such as the netherlands kept alive traditions associated with <unk>
and it was these customs that nineteen th century new <unk> wanted to <unk>
as they sought to make christmas more family friendly the saint nicholas society found the perfect front man in their <unk> who after all was known for being nice to children
it was a genius move
the real goal was getting <unk> off the street remember
now they could do that by turning christmas into a family event when children who had it pretty rough back then would receive gifts for good behavior
but the <unk> needed more than good cheer to change christmas
they needed stories
drawing on the dutch <unk> about <unk> the american author washington <unk> wrote a series of <unk> featuring st. nicholas <unk> high above new york houses smoking a <unk> and delivering presents to well <unk> children
about a decade later in one thousand eight hundred and twenty one an anonymous <unk> called the children's friend featured a magical figure called <unk> who drove a reindeer led <unk> full of <unk> and filled <unk> children's <unk> with little presents
building on that an <unk> scholar named <unk> <unk> <unk> wrote a <unk> for his big <unk> called a visit from st. nicholas
it's now better known as the night before christmas
<unk> for a <unk> professor <unk> <unk> <unk> st. nick of religious <unk> and reasons
nicholas wears a <unk> suit <unk> down <unk> and gives presents to good children
but he says nothing about the reason for the season as contemporary christmas warriors like to say
still <unk> st. nick story went viral <unk> across the northeastern united states faster than reindeer on <unk>
in some early depictions santa claus looks like an <unk> <unk>
in others he looks kind of <unk> as american artists <unk> st. nicholas with european traditions such as the german <unk> who <unk> bad children
by the early one thousand nine hundred s bowler says santa became <unk> as the white bearded red <unk> <unk> eyed <unk> grandfather that we all know and love
and we're not the only ones
<unk> seized on this guy right away bowler says
they immediately saw the possibility that this <unk> could be useful in their selling
in other words santa was <unk> products almost as soon as he <unk> up his <unk>
but before you blame <unk> <unk> for <unk> christmas think back to what it was like before he came to town when kids and many adults really had something to <unk> about
but <unk> success follows tremendous <unk>
as a teenager he survived two horrific years in concentration camps during the holocaust and lost his parents and siblings at the hands of the nazis
in this <unk> from his <unk> measure of a man <unk> describes how an encounter with an <unk> guard at auschwitz led him to pick up a needle and <unk> for the first time and how tragedy taught him the power of clothes
martin <unk>
it was our second day inside auschwitz
the soldiers asked if we knew any <unk> like <unk> <unk> <unk> kind of thing
dad grabbed my <unk> and <unk> it into the air
he is a <unk>
very skilled he said
above the gates at auschwitz was a sign
it read <unk> <unk> <unk>
by <unk> my skills as a <unk> my father protected me
it was his way of marking me for the germans as a jew whose skills they could exploit as one not to be burned
as soon as my father offered up my skills two germans walked toward us to take me away
i then did something i should not have done something <unk>
i ran
why i do not know
<unk> and soldiers were everywhere
where did i think i was going
i can not say
but for whatever reason i ran
a few <unk> into my <unk> i heard a <unk> german <unk> <unk> down on me
my arms <unk> hard as i <unk> my <unk> and ran faster than i'd ever run before
the <unk> got <unk>
i snapped my head back over my shoulder and saw the dog closing in
he <unk> and <unk> his teeth onto my leg
i looked down
the dog hung from my <unk>
i <unk> his head with both hands
he <unk> and <unk> <unk> as i struggled to <unk> him loose
the dog's <unk> <unk> taking a <unk> <unk> with him
blood <unk> on my prisoner uniform the dog's <unk>
i tried not to cry
not in front of my father not in front of the other men and boys
the two soldiers <unk> over to <unk> the dog and make sure he was <unk>
they then <unk> me up off the ground and <unk> me away from the group
i thought maybe that night i would join my father again but that did not happen
that day my second inside auschwitz was the last time i ever saw my father
the germans dragged me to the laundry
whether they wanted me first to perform a <unk> task than <unk> work or whether this was a punishment for trying to flee i do not know
but after my <unk> <unk> i was eager to show the germans i was a hard worker who could be of use
my first job in the camps was <unk> nazi uniforms
i knew nothing of the task
still i grabbed a brush and an <unk> <unk> shirt and <unk> hard and fast
after working my way about <unk> through the pile it happened
i <unk> so hard the <unk> ripped the <unk>
the face of the <unk> soldier at my station <unk> red
i do not remember his words but i remember his <unk>
he beat me until i <unk>
he needed to make an example out of me for the other prisoners
when he was finished with my flogging he <unk> up the torn shirt and threw it in my face before <unk> off
the shirt was trash to the soldier but not to me
i kept it
working in the laundry was a nice man who knew how to <unk>
he gave me a needle and <unk> and taught me how to <unk> a simple <unk>
i <unk> the shirt
to this day i still don't know why but when i got up the courage i <unk> the <unk> shirt on and wore it under my <unk> prisoner uniform
it was a crazy thing to do because none of the other prisoners had a shirt
but i did it <unk>
from that day on the soldiers treated me a little bit better
they thought i was <unk> who <unk> someone not to be killed
the prisoners treated me a little bit better as well
you must remember that some of the <unk> were jewish prisoners but they could be brutal
they wanted to please the germans so some of them would be hard on us so the germans would not punish them
sometimes the <unk> were harsher than some of the germans
when i had my soldier shirt on however that did not happen
when i wore the shirt the <unk> didn't mess with me
the shirt means something i thought
and so i wore the shirt
in fact i ripped another one on purpose so i could have two
the day i first wore that shirt was the day i learned clothes <unk> power
clothes don't just make the man they can save the man
they did for me
of course receiving your first <unk> lesson inside a nazi concentration camp was hardly the ideal <unk>
i would have much <unk> to <unk> my craft on <unk> row or in the <unk> of milan
looking back though that moment in the camps marked the beginning of the rest of my life
<unk> enough two ripped nazi <unk> helped this jew build america's most famous and successful <unk> suit company
martin <unk> <unk> measure of a man is available now
<unk> <unk> twenty from <unk> park in western sydney appeared in <unk> local court wednesday after having been arrested at his home the previous day police said
he was refused bail and is scheduled to <unk> in court on february eighteen court staff said
the maximum sentence he faces is fifteen years police said
a second man a twenty one year old from the sydney suburb of <unk> was also charged by counter terrorism police with <unk> a control order
a person can be subject to a control order if it <unk> helps prevent a terrorist attack or the person has trained with a listed terrorist organization or been convicted of terror offenses according to the australian attorney general department
the charge carries a maximum sentence of two years imprisonment
australian federal police deputy commissioner michael <unk> told reporters that the arrests related to activity that has been going for a while now
this group has had ongoing conversations and activity for the last year he said adding that particularly <unk> action had been taken on eighteen september and again last week prompting the authorities to obtain search <unk>
a significant amount of material had been seized he said
while there was no specific threat of an imminent attack he told reporters
there was enough there that gave concern to us that something was being planned
the documents talked a little bit about potential government targets
the arrests came the same day that australian prime minister tony abbott warned of a heightened level of terror <unk> following the martin place siege in sydney in which two people along with hostage taker man haron monis were killed
the terror threat remains high
and at this level an attack is likely abbott told reporters tuesday
we don't know when and how an attack may come but we do know that there are people with the intent and the capability to carry out further attacks
the arrests were made as part of operation <unk> an ongoing investigation into islamist extremists which led to sweeping pre dawn counter terror raids in sydney in september
eleven people have been arrested in relation to the operation so far police said
<unk> said operation <unk> was focused on a group of fifteen to twenty people in the sydney region who <unk> with isis ideology and who had been actively monitored for some time
a police spokeswoman would not comment on claims in australian media that the target allegedly mentioned in the documents was an australian federal police building or that the documents described a plan to conduct <unk> warfare in new south wales blue mountains
following his arrest footage appeared in australian media of <unk> dressed in a <unk> bearing the isis flag <unk> off the set of an australian current affairs show in august in which guests had been <unk> local support for islamic extremism
a dozen young children <unk> and <unk> around me taking my <unk> and pen to write down their addresses very carefully
this way they tell me i'll know where to send help
but how do you tell a six year old an address no longer means anything houses and roads are gone and in too many cases so are families
it was not just the young who could not <unk> how their world changed on december twenty six two thousand and four
in <unk> on the south coast of sri lanka a <unk> <unk> through <unk> debris in the area they <unk> their house had once stood looking for lost children
siblings children <unk> all looking for a sign of relatives they lost in a split second when the water came
standing in the middle of what was once the marketplace of this <unk> town i looked around at a landscape that was almost flat
no buildings for miles giving a clear view of the sea that was <unk> calm and <unk>
only one temple was left standing the one structure built from concrete
homes were washed away with residents still inside market <unk> and thousands of shoppers didn't stand a chance against the sheer force of mother nature
it is impossible to capture the extent of the devastation on camera and only those who lived through that day know its true horror
but one overwhelming memory for those who arrived afterward is the look in survivors eyes
i accompanied a u.s. doctor working for <unk> jonathan fine who had volunteered to help and deliver desperately needed supplies
he told me he would never forget the victims dead eyed in their hospital <unk> lying there <unk> at us <unk> what their stories were how they'll ever learn to cope with this what they've seen what they've lost
and yet in the midst of the <unk> i witnessed in sri lanka was incredible generosity
residents who had lost everything who had seen horror beyond imagination running up to us to offer a face mask to help cope with the <unk> <unk> of death trying to give us a bottle of water
one man even apologized we were not seeing his country at its best <unk> me to come back when it was all over so i could experience the true beauty and hospitality of the island and its people
he then resumed the search for his brother sister and parents
the sheer scale of the disaster was difficult to <unk>
one <unk> hospital that could take three hundred patients at a push saw one thousand serious injuries in the first two days alone
basic drugs many of us take for granted ran out quickly and the <unk> of relief familiar in such disasters took time to clear
and yet rarely did i see <unk> <unk> over
residents helped each other and <unk> each other
one <unk> factory had been badly damaged some of the workers were dead or missing
but rather than wait for outside help to arrive the workers cleared the building of mud debris and bodies so they could go back to work
many of the women were married to <unk> who had lost boats or were too scared to go back out on the water
without the factory their families had no income
natural disasters are cruel and brutal
there is no one to blame and little <unk>
and yet they never fail to restore my faith in human nature
strangers work together to pick themselves back up and <unk> their shattered lives
many thinking of others rather than themselves
what i witnessed in sri lanka was both heartbreaking and inspiring at the same time
a suicide bomber killed thirty eight people and wounded dozens more in a town near baghdad on wednesday police said
the attacker detonated explosives near awakening council members in al <unk> a town roughly twenty kilometers southeast of baghdad as they were collecting their monthly <unk> at the <unk> headquarters
the awakening <unk> are predominantly made up of sunni arab fighters in iraq who turned against al qaeda in late two thousand and six
the u.s. backed movement is credited as being one of the main factors that contributed to a drop in violence across iraq
but council members have become targets for jihadists notably the sunni extremist group isis which has seized key areas of iraqi territory this year
the majority of the casualties in the al <unk> attack were reported to be awakening council members
fifty six people were wounded in the bombing police said
the captured f sixteen pilot is moaz al kasasbeh a member of jordan's military according to his uncle retired jordanian maj. gen. <unk> al <unk>
a source in jordan's armed forces said that the pilot was <unk> carrying out a mission wednesday around raqqa the militant group's de facto capital in northern syria according to jordan's official <unk> news agency
jordan holds the terror organization and those who support it responsible for the safety of the pilot and the <unk> of his life the source said
the london based syrian observatory for human rights had reported earlier wednesday that isis had shot down an unidentified <unk> near raqqa a city that has been a chief target in the u.s. led military <unk> air campaign
photos purported to be of the <unk> pilot appeared on an isis affiliated twitter account images that <unk> al <unk> said showed his nephew
the retired general told cnn that he'd asked maj. gen. mansour s. al <unk> head of the royal jordanian air force to investigate the case and take all necessary actions
the international coalition has been conducting airstrike after airstrike against isis in syria since september an effort that began weeks after first going after the group in neighboring iraq
in that period the coalition has claimed many successful hits that have damaged the militant group
but this time it's the coalition that has taken a hit
while the united states has been at the head of this coalition it's relied on a number of other countries to help <unk> as well as to help <unk> the effort internationally
many nations have signed up to do so in iraq whose government is actively <unk> with the coalition to target isis
but syria has been a bit more complicated
officials from the united states and elsewhere support moderate forces in syria's years long civil war trying to <unk> president bashar al assad despite the fact they are both fighting against isis
some middle eastern nations however have joined the united states in going after isis in syria
jordan which borders syria iraq and israel and has a history of working with washington has been notable among them
one big question now becomes what isis does with moaz al kasasbeh now that it has him in captivity
their track record unfortunately speaks for itself
the beheadings of hostages including american journalist james foley was one of the things that spurred the united states to step up its fight against isis
those were just some of the many <unk> blamed on the sunni extremist group committed during its quest to create a caliphate which it calls the islamic state under its strict form of sharia law
isis has tried to justify its raping and <unk> of women and children not to mention mass killings of civilians as part of its campaign to <unk> nonbelievers
the jordanian military source cited by <unk> noted isis past when talking about its capture of the f sixteen pilot
it is well known that this organization does not hide their terrorist <unk> the source said
and they have carried out many criminal acts of destruction and killing of innocent muslims and non muslims in syria and iraq
censorship is a part of daily life in china
news <unk> are <unk> from online search engines social media sites such as facebook and twitter are banned and cnn is <unk> <unk> out for chinese viewers
instagram was a huge hit in china until the government banned it during the hong kong protests
all good things must end one young chinese woman told me seemingly resigned to the fact that she can no longer post photos on instagram
while such restrictions would likely <unk> mass outrage in many western countries citizens in china often have no choice but to <unk> some personal freedom as the government keeps a firm grip on certain aspects of life in this booming society

<unk> overall revenue <unk> fifty four percents to over two point seven billion dollar in two thousand and fourteen
china e commerce <unk> are expected to <unk> to more than seven hundred billion dollar by two thousand and seventeen
but with the internet comes the risk of sharing information that the chinese government worries could <unk> the country
in china any threat to the communist party's <unk> <unk> grip must be controlled
it's why you're likely to find very little mention of north korea's bureau one hundred and twenty one in this nation suspected of having its own <unk> people's liberation army unit sixty one thousand three hundred and ninety eight believed to be responsible for <unk>
<unk> the chinese military has also <unk> the united states for having its own massive <unk> program
as all of this continues to <unk> one thing is certain
international news organizations such as cnn will continue with extensive coverage
and thanks to heavy handed government <unk> most citizens of china will continue get only the news deemed appropriate by the government

editor's note
<unk> <unk> is president of architects designers <unk> for social responsibility a nonprofit group that advocates for <unk> responsible design
he is a member of the american institute of architects and a <unk> justice fellow
the opinions expressed in this commentary are his
in the wake of this <unk> senate report <unk> <unk> acts of torture by the cia at guantanamo bay and elsewhere the american psychological association announced it is actively investigating <unk> of its members with the torture program at guantanamo
meanwhile a decision last week by my own professional association the american institute of architects or <unk> suggests that impunity for all may be the order of the day
despite years of advocacy and formal requests the <unk> which claims as its members a majority of the roughly one hundred and ten thousand architects in the united states has officially declined to add specific language to its code of ethics that would <unk> the design of torture chambers in u.s. prisons and around the world
in doing so it <unk> anti trust concerns and the potential difficulty of <unk> the <unk> but it <unk> the claims of human rights
to be sure the <unk> ethics code contains <unk> language that <unk> states members should <unk> human rights in all their professional <unk>
contrast that for example with the code of the american medical association or the world medical association tokyo declaration on torture which reads the <unk> shall not provide any <unk> instruments <unk> or knowledge to <unk> the practice of torture
that leaves providing the <unk> for torture up to us architects and as far as the <unk> is concerned we are open for business
yes the prisons at guantanamo had architects
the design of camp six was based on the <unk> county <unk> jail according to its architect
other camps were built with <unk> steel prison cells a popular jail building technology that may well have been used to <unk> the cia's black site prisons overseas
the only apparent justification for the additional expense and complexity of building on such remote sites with no access to local labor or building materials was that these were places where the legal system could not <unk> with <unk> detention and enhanced interrogation techniques
the <unk> decision not to <unk> design for torture is not just about a handful of <unk> projects however despite the horrific and planned for consequences for some of the <unk> taken to those buildings
it's also about the design of spaces in more conventional prisons intended for prolonged <unk> <unk>
a practice <unk> regarded as a form of torture by amnesty international human rights watch and the u.n. special <unk> on torture
these organizations are but some of the human rights advocates that wrote letters urging the <unk> to <unk> a <unk>
here in the united states about twenty thousand people are held in <unk> <unk> in one of forty five or so specially designed <unk> prisons and some sixty thousand more are held in <unk> wings and security housing units in state prisons and the hole in county <unk>
while architects can not be held responsible for <unk> uses of the spaces they design the intention of most of these spaces is clear from the get go
the use of remote controlled doors <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and solid cell fronts with special pass through <unk> are all architectural features that enable and <unk> isolation leading <unk> to psychological pain
half of all prison <unk> happen to the approximately four percents of people in <unk> <unk>
architecture <unk> this suffering and these deaths
in the face of the <unk> torture report citizens can by and large only watch the different <unk> of government contest what happened
but just as all americans are <unk> and put at risk by our country's reputation for torture all of us have opportunities within the multiple roles we play in life to reject torture and <unk> <unk>
as citizens it is our responsibility to vote out <unk> and to demand prosecutions of perpetrators so that torture will never happen again
likewise all <unk> professionals have a responsibility to protect the health safety and welfare of the public
and for me and my fellow architects we must further protect our values by changing building <unk> and industry standards as new challenges emerge
the <unk> of <unk> leading architectural association to <unk> the design of torture facilities is a shocking <unk> and deeply troubling statement
it <unk> to place any limit on the potential role of design in human rights violations even the most <unk>
<unk> begins at home
unless and until the <unk> <unk> the issue american architects are represented by a professional association whose ethical boundaries include the <unk> of torture
so back to business
how far apart should those ceiling <unk> be
what <unk> did you want for that <unk>
and of course i think it all looks best in black
south korean prosecutors are seeking an arrest warrant for the former korean air executive heather cho who sparked outrage by kicking a flight attendant off a plane for serving <unk> nuts the wrong way
the warrant would cover charges of violating aviation safety rules including a change in a flight plan assault on a plane <unk> and interference in the execution of duty the seoul western district prosecutors office said wednesday
a decision will be taken on <unk> of the warrant early next week after a review procedure the prosecutors office said
cho the forty year old daughter of korean <unk> chairman resigned from her post as vice president at the company in the aftermath of the incident earlier this month on a flight from new york's <unk> airport to south korea's <unk> international airport
she ordered that the plane turn back to the gate and that a flight attendant be removed because she was served nuts in a bag instead of on a plate in first class
amid public anger over her behavior she and her father both apologized for the incident
cho whose korean name is cho <unk> ah said she accepted full responsibility for what happened
she wasn't available for comment wednesday
<unk> of crew members and passengers confirm that cho used violent language in a loud voice which may not be <unk> with an aviation safety law that requires cooperation of passengers on a flight the ministry of land infrastructure and transport said last week
although her role put her in charge of in flight service she was only a passenger on the flight and was not flying in an official capacity
officials are also seeking an arrest warrant for another korean air executive identified by his <unk> of <unk> on charges of ordering employees to <unk> an initial report of the incident the prosecutors office said
korean air said wednesday it was monitoring the situation as an arrest warrant hadn't been issued yet
the office said that prosecutors had raided the office and residence of a government official at the ministry of land infrastructure and transport who was suspected of <unk> information on the investigation into the case to <unk>
the captain of the plane has also faced criticism for <unk> <unk> demands to turn back the plane and remove the flight attendant
because of that the airline faces possible disciplinary action from the government because of the <unk> failure to command and <unk> crew members to ensure the safe operation of the flight the ministry said last week
devices are getting cheaper and internet access is slowly becoming universal but how we use it is broken and needs to change

information needs to be <unk> and controlled especially our health data
some information needs to be locked down
medical information needs to be protected and not given away to the wrong people only hospitals
but the people who have access to that information including doctors need to be accountable and that data needs to be tracked
business will need to practice greater transparency
it's up to each business about how it <unk>
large companies can learn to be more <unk> internally and <unk> with some <unk>
banks need to practice better security
banks encourage bad <unk> by asking for <unk> on the phone they should ask consumers to call back on the number on the back of the card instead of asking you for your security details

in <unk> president barack obama's opening to cuba <unk> republican <unk> <unk> rubio explained this entire policy shift announced today is based on an <unk> on a lie the lie and the <unk> that more commerce and access to money and goods will translate to political freedom for the cuban people
rubio has <unk> touched on the core issue
but theory <unk> and history suggest that he's wrong in his conclusions
i would <unk> to rubio one of the <unk> of conservative thought <unk> <unk> <unk> and freedom
he doesn't have to spend too much time on it
the first <unk> <unk> the relation between economic freedom and political freedom
the point <unk> makes in the book is one that america's founding fathers well understood
drawing on the political <unk> john <unk> they believed that the freedom to buy sell own and trade were core elements of human freedom and individual <unk>
as they expand liberty <unk>
this is not just theory of course
over the last two centuries the countries that embraced more commerce and access to money and goods in <unk> phrase britain america then western europe and east asia have moved toward greater prosperity but also political freedom
if you <unk> oil rich countries where money is not earned but dug from the ground almost every country that has used free markets and free trade to grow is also a democracy
yes there are a few <unk>
singapore and china but on the whole there has been a <unk> strong connection between economic freedom and political freedom
in latin america itself the line has been clear
<unk> <unk> regime opened up its economy in the one thousand nine hundred and seventy s. <unk> began to grow but that growth then produced a stronger civil society that over time <unk> for the end of the <unk> dictatorship
in latin america today democracy and markets have acted to <unk> each other <unk> the continent which thirty years ago was almost entirely ruled by <unk> to one that is today almost entirely ruled by <unk>
cuba is an <unk> one of the last <unk> in latin america that has embraced neither markets nor <unk>
the obama administration is acting on the theory that more commerce <unk> contact travel and trade will <unk> the people of cuba and thus give them a greater voice in their political future
and so the first point to make is that it will help cubans economically it will raise their <unk> their standard of living and boost access to technology
these are all good things in and of themselves
but <unk> the embargo will also help americans who will benefit from being able to trade with a neighbor
this is the reason that conservatives have long understood that free trade is not a gift <unk> on someone
it helps both countries and in particular helps the united states
that's why the wall street <unk> editorial page <unk> of conservative thought has been an advocate on <unk> the trade embargo against cuba which is a far larger step than obama's <unk>
so did it support obama's opening
of course not
it turns out that he has done it in the wrong way
it is difficult not to think that the problem here is not the policy but who the president is
had george w. bush announced this initiative i have a feeling that the wall street journal would be <unk> it and rubio would be <unk> <unk> <unk> to us all

sure you can follow <unk> trail around the world and start shooting in different locations or you can spend most of your time in serbia
<unk> <unk> <unk> as <unk> the one thousand nine hundred and eighty nine tv <unk> of <unk> around the world in eighty days was mainly <unk> in and around the <unk> country then part of yugoslavia
thanks to its diverse landscape and impressive architecture serbia represented a total of eighteen countries in the mini series while the city of belgrade served as the backdrop for seven world cities
serbia has a very long tradition of film making says <unk> <unk> executive director of the serbia film commission
back in the one thousand nine hundred and seventy s and one thousand nine hundred and eighty s there were so many huge co <unk> that were made here
and now <unk> are taking notice once again as serbia steps up its efforts to raise its profile as an important player in international <unk>
from medieval <unk> to <unk> mountains to modern <unk> it seems that every corner and <unk> in serbia can make the cut in hollywood
international hits shot at least partly in the country include the film <unk> of william <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> the two thousand and twelve period <unk> the <unk> with john <unk> while recently <unk> <unk> returned to the country too to film spy action <unk> the november man
serbia has done some really great <unk> in recent years says <unk>
it has proven to be a really good <unk> high quality service filming destination it is quite hot now
<unk> renewed focus on building an impressive reputation in international movie production is benefiting several local industry players
one of them is film producer is <unk> <unk> who is <unk> her movie making savvy with a <unk> approach to <unk> to win more and more big budget films
she says that it wasn't always that way
they would say <unk> no way we are not going there it's cold
and so it's like no no no it's serbia
you can you imagine what the reaction to serbia was jokes <unk> founder of work in progress <unk>
that's changed completely now she continues
the <unk> is out that here it's not just very good crews and all that but it's a good time that you have working in belgrade
and again everybody has such a low expectations when it comes to us then they get <unk> surprised and so they like it here
but it's not just movie <unk> taking advantage of <unk> bid to emerge as a key force in international <unk>
<unk> <unk> is a serbian actor who's found success at home and went on to appear at <unk>
he says he's proud not just of his own <unk> but of the talent and skill of the crews and production teams he works with
during all those bad times that happened in the past an industry that did not fall back was the film industry he says
that's important for the culture of the people and i believe that a country makes its image through culture

at least sixty three people have been killed in a series of attacks by tribal militants in india's remote northeastern state of assam a police official said wednesday
the attacks by fighters from the bodo tribe took place tuesday assam police inspector general <unk>
singh told cnn
the bodo insurgents apparently angry over a recent police crackdown that led to several arrests and the <unk> of weapons targeted members of another tribal community said <unk> <unk> the state police chief
india's impoverished northeast region has a high concentration of extremist groups from different backgrounds with conflicting ethnic and political interests
members of the bodo tribe an indigenous group have fought for decades for political <unk>
they also have long standing tensions with muslim <unk> in assam
but in this case they attacked members of another tribal community police said
<unk> didn't provide the name of the <unk> who were targeted but called them soft targets
he said the bodo fighters used guns in the attacks
authorities have ordered a <unk> in areas targeted by the extremists police said
indian home minister <unk> singh is expected to visit assam on wednesday to review the situation his spokesman <unk>
<unk> said
dozens of people were killed in ethnic violence involving bodo tribe members and muslim migrants in two thousand and twelve
the unrest in which villages were burned down displaced hundreds of thousands of people

looking at new business models and innovations cnn explains and <unk> all aspects of this <unk> global shift
in the <unk> <unk> of africa's <unk> nation plans are <unk> to <unk> take the continent where it has never gone before the deepest <unk> of <unk> space
it's here in south africa's karoo desert that construction is scheduled to begin on the square kilometer array a cluster of three thousand satellites working in <unk> over a square kilometer area
this highly sensitive collective of dishes and <unk> will combine to act as a giant radio telescope the biggest in the world when built according to the ska organization <unk> the dark heart of space
an accompanying selection of array and <unk> <unk> meanwhile will provide continuous coverage of radio waves between seventy <unk> and ten <unk> that <unk> the earth's atmosphere
scientists hope the project will shed further light on the <unk> posed by the likes of <unk> dark matter and black <unk>
according to phil <unk> director general of the ska <unk> the project could even enable scientists to pick up signals from <unk> should they exist although this isn't the projects primary objective
there's also the exciting possibility of capturing information on how the universe evolved in its <unk> moments
for science the prize is clearly huge
a full budget for the ska is yet to be confirmed but construction is <unk> to begin by two thousand and eighteen
given the scale of the project which has the backing of eleven member countries some have even dubbed the ska <unk> version of the large <unk> <unk>
for south africa and the wider african continent there are also many <unk> benefits
the ska an international affair is <unk> in the uk with the telescope itself planned for a <unk> site location in australia and south africa
distant stations will also be set up in <unk> kenya <unk> mauritius mozambique namibia <unk> and ghana
ska south africa is also building the <unk> radio telescope which will act as a <unk> to the ska and later be integrated into the larger telescope
the construction observation and <unk> of these facilities will provide skilled jobs for local people
ska south africa project director <unk> fanaroff meanwhile says that the telescope array will generate more data in a day than already exists on the entire internet
as such new computer software and programs that can <unk> <unk> data and allow humans to <unk> with it in a simple and time efficient manner are currently being developed
given the increasing importance of big data collection and analysis across a host of contemporary industries south africa's government is taking a <unk> risk that the technologies <unk> these systems will find further commercial use both in africa and beyond
for the <unk> nation these are clearly exciting and potentially lucrative developments to be a part of
south africa wants to move away from being resource heavy economy to bring young people into science and technology explains fanaroff
building the ska
is a way of <unk> and getting people to accept that science and tech is a key part of development
this is a point of view that dr <unk> <unk> head of the south african national space agency strongly <unk> with
he points to successful <unk> programs currently underway including the development and launch of satellites that provide data used to <unk> government decisions on security agriculture and environmental protection which prove the benefits of serious investment in a modern space program
the agency also gave help to nasa's mars curiosity mission during launch in two thousand and eleven
endless <unk> through innovation and new technologies which may be <unk> on earth <unk> says
the necessary knowledge and skills developed through such missions will open doors for our people to position themselves equally on the global space stage and even bring in external funding to our countries thus boosting the economies he adds
south africa isn't the only african nation thinking along these lines
nigeria morocco tunisia algeria and egypt have all established space and satellite programs with similar aims
ghana uganda <unk> <unk> and kenya meanwhile have voiced their commitment to follow suit
some observers question whether the <unk> infrastructure to enable these ambitions to flourish in the long term is currently in place
<unk> <unk> a harvard university professor and co chair of the african <unk> high level panel on science technology and innovation told cnn that while it is right that african nations invest in space technology they must do so in a <unk> and strategic manner
he points to the importance of focusing on education and inspiring future generations to become scientists and engineers to create valuable and highly skilled <unk>
what we don't want is <unk> space programs <unk> said
as it stands i think they are focusing more on the space programs and less on the education
have to be designed as a capability program otherwise the economic return will not be fully realized
while this may be the case for some african nations fanaroff says that since two thousand and five south africa has issued some six hundred <unk> in their human capacity development program covering everything from research chairs down to <unk> training
we're putting a lot of young people through a <unk> where we're trying to take them into <unk> and physics or engineering in their first or second year of university and taking them all the way through to post <unk> <unk>
that's starting to work quite well adds fanaroff
despite his concerns about infrastructure <unk> <unk> is enthusiastic about the broader aims of developing space programs on the continent
there are others however who say that african nations should focus more on providing for the basic needs of their populations than on the luxury of space investment
south africa has one of the largest <unk> between rich and poor globally with millions living in <unk> towns although earlier this year the government reported that the population living in extreme poverty has dropped by two point four million since two thousand and six
egypt has been <unk> by political instability and violence since former president of thirty years <unk> mubarak was forced to <unk> by protesters in two thousand and eleven and the subsequent <unk> in two thousand and thirteen of president mohamed morsy in a military coup
and in nigeria some regions <unk> the <unk> record of having sixty percents of their population living in extreme poverty
matthew <unk> from the british <unk> alliance body was quoted by the uk's independent newspaper in two thousand and thirteen asking why his country was sending money to provide development assistance to nations like nigeria and south africa when they are investing in space technologies
if a foreign government has enough cash to invest in an ambitious space program it should not expect to be receiving cash from the uk <unk> said
the likes of <unk> and fanaroff however have little time for these suggestions
this is an argument we hear often and is largely as a result of the public not being able to make the link between the benefits of space investment against addressing <unk> needs <unk> says
africa has <unk> challenges with poverty hunger and access to <unk> water which can all be <unk> through investment in space by providing valuable data that can make public policy more efficient for example
on top of this innovations that arise from the out of the box thinking that space <unk> will impact on growing local economies and create opportunities for africans in the global market he adds
fanaroff however is more <unk> in his <unk>
we don't accept that south africa has to remain on the edge of civilization
that we don't accept that's the old colonial way of thinking fanaroff says
for south africa and africa the next great economic growth story he adds
we will play a role in the future

a little earlier this year renowned <unk> <unk> <unk> died aged eighty four after a long and <unk> career as grand <unk>
while we weren't close friends i think i can say we <unk> through an extraordinary shared experience
the two thousand and eight visit by the new york philharmonic orchestra to pyongyang north korea
in light of the u.s. government accusing north korea of the massive hack attack against sony at the end of this year it is extraordinary to look back and reflect on a different atmosphere that <unk> between the two countries for a brief moment in time
along with a large delegation of international press i was invited to travel with the new york philharmonic on a cultural <unk>
<unk> <unk> was <unk>
just as <unk> <unk> <unk> had opened the door to <unk> relations between the united states and communist china he told me he hoped musical <unk> could do the same with one of the last <unk> of <unk> communist dictatorship
and so one freezing sunny morning in february a <unk> of <unk> all landed in pyongyang in a flourish the likes of which the government and the people had never seen
we watched as <unk> and his musicians <unk> and <unk> gave <unk> to some of north korea's top musicians and finally delivered a <unk> performance on stage at the city's main concert hall
the audience was treated to all american <unk> by george <unk> and the concert ended with one of korea's best loved <unk> songs <unk>
north korea's invited elite were on their feet with standing <unk>
and for two countries still officially at war since the korean war ended only with an <unk> just imagine how it felt in that concert hall and for koreans listening on radio and tv at home to hear both countries national <unk> played in public on stage for the first time
remember this was during the bush administration george w. bush had called north korea part of the <unk> of evil and yet change was in the air
away from the concert hall i was one of a small group of journalists taken to the <unk> nuclear plant where then leader kim jong il had started <unk> crucial parts and freezing the weapons program
a few months later i went back to witness north korea blow up the <unk> iconic <unk> tower
it seemed <unk> <unk> and the new york philharmonic were on to something
but shortly <unk> kim jong il fell ill and died his son kim jong un came to power with a ruthless <unk> a <unk> for testing his nuclear weapons and apparently capable of massive cyber attacks on america's top companies
<unk> <unk> died without <unk> this dream but i am grateful to have been there for that brief moment in time when he brought hope and the sound of beautiful music to north korea

he seemed at that moment less like a rock star than like someone who sort of <unk> on stage from the <unk> of <unk> young people <unk> and <unk> in the <unk>
he appeared <unk> and <unk>
a <unk> <unk> <unk> fellow who somehow found himself among the rock <unk> <unk> <unk> who showed up in <unk> new york forty five <unk> ago to help <unk> a collective blessing upon a generation
then joe <unk> started to sing a song that it's safe to say everybody within hearing range of that stage knew by heart
it was what was widely recognized as the <unk> number from the already classic <unk> <unk> sgt
<unk> <unk> hearts club band from two years ago
with a little help from my friends was the kind of <unk> user friendly <unk> that even a <unk> grown up could love enough to sing along with decades before anyone heard the word <unk>
anybody in other words could make the song work for them whether in a <unk> or a corner bar
joe <unk> at that moment did more than just make it work
he worked that song over <unk> its <unk> <unk> <unk> apart and <unk> it into something with more <unk> <unk> and dramatic <unk> than the <unk> could have <unk>
the cameras that captured that <unk> performance for all time stayed on him for practically the entire song <unk> up and down <unk> <unk> form focusing on his hands as they <unk> an invisible <unk> wrenching every <unk> <unk> and extended <unk> he could <unk> through the vibrant <unk> of his voice
that little <unk> <unk> star introduced to the world became in <unk> <unk> <unk> hands an <unk> flag <unk> a soul music anthem
<unk> didn't just cover that song
he <unk> it and made it his own
his performance one of the many <unk> of the one thousand nine hundred and seventy <unk> documentary about that festival <unk> was the first thing most people of a certain age thought of when they heard the news of <unk> death at seventy from <unk> cancer
it was what monday's <unk> evening news broadcast mentioned first and foremost when <unk> <unk> passing and the film clip accompanied many tweets and posts on social media
<unk> as that moment was it was only the beginning of a solid steady career for <unk> who scored <unk> <unk> rock hits throughout the one thousand nine hundred and seventy s including <unk> <unk> and you are so beautiful
his one thousand nine hundred and eighty two <unk> with jennifer <unk> up where we belong pretty much <unk> his string of hits
his <unk> voice and his <unk> however remained in demand throughout the world and it says something about his <unk> appeal that so many people from different generations say they went straight to those and other <unk> to hear that <unk> fiery <unk> once again

<unk>
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author
some years ago i was the <unk> prosecutor in a <unk> new jersey town
i had weekly night court <unk> where we handled traffic violations <unk> and other <unk>
i can say without <unk> that during the years i worked as a prosecutor i held the police in the highest regard and greatly <unk> them
i felt this way for years after i stopped prosecuting
but those feelings are gone
don't get me wrong i don't view the police as the enemy
i simply don't trust them like i once did
i no longer give them the benefit of the doubt meaning i can now just as easily believe the suspect's version of the facts as the police officers
and i can easily believe allegations of police misconduct
and here's what new york city police union leader patrick lynch and others like him in the new york police department don't get
i'm not the exception
in fact my views about police put me in the company of a growing number of americans
a <unk> poll released a few weeks ago found that forty eight percents of americans view the police as <unk> high or very high levels of <unk> and ethics
that number is not only down six <unk> points from two thousand and thirteen it's the lowest in almost twenty years
in contrast sixty eight percents of americans viewed the police as <unk> high levels of <unk> and ethics in two thousand and one
that's an <unk> twenty point drop in thirteen years
to me these falling poll numbers are tied at least in part to a case like eric garner the <unk> man placed in a chokehold by a new york officer and who died a short time later
a recent poll found that fifty seven percents of americans believed that the grand jury had made a mistake in failing to indict the officer who had <unk> garner with only twenty two percents <unk> with the grand <unk> decision
it's with that twenty two percents of people where lynch president of the new york city <unk> <unk> association and his <unk> stand
indeed after the grand decision was announced a few weeks ago lynch made matters worse with two tone <unk> comments
first he seemingly blamed garner for his own death with the <unk> garner made a choice that day to resist arrest
he then <unk> added that garner's death is a tragedy for this police officer who has to live with that death
a tragedy for the police officer
the police officer is alive
garner is dead
yet to lynch we should have sympathy for the police officer who most of us believe should be facing criminal charges for homicide
and lynch has not let up in his apparent efforts to drive a <unk> between the public and the new york police department
on saturday night shortly after we learned of the horrific slayings of two new york police officers at the hands of a man who reportedly said he wanted to avenge the deaths of garner and michael brown lynch released one of the most <unk> statements i've ever heard from a person in his position
lynch said there's blood on many hands in the <unk> killings
first he blamed new york mayor bill de blasio who has in the past been slightly critical of certain of the <unk> actions saying that the blood on the hands starts on the steps of city hall in the office of the mayor
then lynch blamed the recent protesters who had taken to the streets to denounce the grand jury decision in the garner case
just so it's clear a small number of protesters did <unk> <unk> what do we want
dead cops
but it's <unk> to blame the protesters for the actions of a man with a long criminal record who had shot his girlfriend only hours before killing the police officers
<unk> comments sounded like a politician using a tragedy to score political points
in fact former new york gov
george pataki a republican who is said to be considering a presidential run in two thousand and sixteen made comments similar to <unk> via twitter where he blamed de blasio for the tragedy
lynch is missing the big picture
sure for politicians such as pataki <unk> to the base is the <unk>
but the leader of a union that represents more than thirty four thousand <unk> officers charged with protecting and serving the public needs to be better than offering up red meat to his supporters
lynch is viewed by many as the spokesman for rank and file new york police department officers
<unk> his remarks could result in an even fewer americans viewing the police in a favorable light
that does not <unk> well for us a nation
if we <unk> view the police as an <unk> <unk> and not an ally it <unk> the very notion of community based policing that is the <unk> to effective policing
the question is
will lynch and his supporters change their tune or will they make matters worse

in addition to the five victims hospitalized the driver is as well <unk> said
the driver stabbed himself twice after the incident but is expected to survive said pierre henry <unk> a spokesman for france's interior ministry
an investigation for murder and attempted murder has been opened
officials have said the incident appears to be an isolated case and not an act of terrorism
but it came after two other incidents in which the perpetrators were reported to have been <unk> god is great in arabic at the time of their attacks
one took place sunday in <unk> in which a man rammed his vehicle into pedestrians injuring at least twelve police said
a man has been arrested in connection with the case
cnn affiliate <unk> tv reported that <unk> heard the driver <unk> the phrase allahu akbar
on saturday a man stabbed three police officers in central france while allegedly calling out the same phrase
french counterterrorism authorities are investigating that attack
cnn terrorism analyst paul cruickshank reported that the attacker behind sunday's incident was a forty year old french north african with a long history of <unk> problems and the perpetrator of sunday's attack was a twenty year old french <unk> who had posted the isis flag on his facebook page
france's prime minister has said his country has never faced as serious a terrorism threat as it does now

the number of ebola cases in west africa has not reached worst case <unk> predictions but until it drops to zero the world remains at risk the <unk> director said monday
speaking to reporters after a visit to liberia guinea and sierra leone centers for disease prevention director dr. tom frieden said he saw real momentum and real progress in combating the virus
it's going to be a long hard fight but i am hopeful that we are going to see continued progress
the challenge is not to let up not to be <unk> and to really double down he said
last week the world health organization put the number of reported deaths from ebola at six thousand nine hundred and fifteen with more than eighteen thousand six hundred cases of the disease reported
asked about the <unk> report in september that in certain scenarios ebola cases could reach five hundred and fifty thousand by january frieden said
the <unk> we released a few months ago showed what could happen if nothing more were done in fact an enormous amount has been done
he said what had changed was the world's reaction response to not letting that happen
liberia had the most hopeful picture of the three countries frieden said
as of today it has the upper hand over the virus
this was due to the country's implementation of the rapid isolation and treatment for ebola approach he said
extensive challenges remain however in sierra leone he said
sierra leone has by far the largest number of cases of the three countries at this point and is in a rapid scale up phase
this is in part a result of the challenge of <unk> he said
as the number of cases fell he said health care workers were <unk> their grip by for example not wearing protective clothing or <unk> the possibility of ebola infection when treating patients for other <unk>
three actions were important to combat the next phase of the outbreak frieden said
first break the cycle of <unk> growth
second trace every chain of transmission and ensure the intensive <unk> of every patient with ebola
and third <unk> the areas that were now ebola free to prevent outbreaks there he said
the next phase is in many ways harder it's <unk> every single case to break every single chain of transmission including in highly mobile urban areas and that's going to be challenging he said
the problem is there are <unk> all over and new ones popping up all the time
<unk> each of the three countries get to the last cluster the last case then we're at risk
a lot had been done to combat ebola frieden said but it was still a work in progress with for example more french speaking health care workers needed in guinea to stop the spread there
tools on the <unk> included a new point of care <unk> <unk> that would allow health care workers to <unk> the virus on the spot rather than having to make sometimes <unk> trips back from remote areas for lab testing of suspected cases
frieden said that another new initiative in sierra leone would allow the <unk> of thousands of health care workers if and when a safe vaccine was developed
but he said with new tools especially the vaccine we have to <unk> hope that they work urgently but we can't count on them working

it was a phone call that would change his life forever
i was called in the morning by my elder brother <unk> me of an attack on the school where my daughter was schooling he said
<unk> blood went cold as his brother continued telling him that some of the girls had been abducted by boko haram
samuel knew only too well the vicious and brutal nature of the terrorist group
just a few months before this boko haram had attacked his village in northeastern nigeria
armed men forced him out of his house and one of them pointed a gun to his head
by a sheer miracle <unk> even to samuel one of the militants <unk> and his life was spared
their entire village was <unk> to the ground and so samuel moved his family to chibok and enrolled his <unk> daughter sarah into the government <unk> school so that she could sit for her final high school <unk>
he chose chibok because not only was it his <unk> home and he had relatives there but also because it had no history of boko haram attacks
he felt it was safe until now
later in the day <unk> brother <unk> him again
then before sunset he called me again and informed me that my daughter was part of those that were taken by boko haram
his wife <unk> says the news of her daughter's abduction <unk> at her heart
she refused to believe it when her husband first told it to her until it was confirmed on the evening news
seriously seriously <unk> and her daughter
the pain is <unk> she reflects
<unk> says there is not a day that goes by that she does think of her daughter
she describes her daughter as an ambitious girl who saw education as a way out of poverty
she used to tell me one day she will finish school and become somebody
she used to assist the younger ones with their <unk> she said
she loved studies
she used to fall <unk> with her books in her arms she added
her father remembers her as the caring <unk> child who used to <unk> collect his dirty clothes wash them and press them for him
he also remembers her passion for knowledge
she is brilliant
she liked reading
always she loved going to school he said
inside their small one <unk> house there is nothing to indicate that the christmas <unk> season has begun
they say christmas used to be a time of <unk> and spending time with family
every christmas we used to be complete and happy but now one of us is not there how can it be the same
asks samuel
there is nothing i can say
it has happened
it is a bad christmas
but there is nothing we can do says <unk>
a sadness surrounds the couple as they <unk> to the only physical memory that they have of their daughter a few photos and one bright green top one of her <unk>
but although they are at low spirits they say their hopes remain high that their daughter will come back
they pass on that <unk> to their other five children who say they miss their sister
her siblings know that she is not here they themselves know what is happening having come out of war says samuel
they keep asking me when is she coming back
but i keep telling them to keep <unk> god

kwok was also ordered to pay a sixty four thousand four hundred and fifty three dollar fine and one point six million dollar in costs to the prosecution while hui was ordered to pay the hong kong government one point four million dollar equivalent to the amount of bribes taken
the main question during their trial was whether kwok and his younger brother raymond kwok had bought the allegiance of hui when he was in public office in offenses spanning nearly a decade

it's a story which has captured the imagination of the english premier league and persuaded one uk <unk> to use it for its christmas tv <unk> but did rival armies really turn the world war i killing fields into a football field
a century on from the first christmas of the great war there has been a rush to <unk> one of the most iconic moments in british military history
the story goes that on december twenty five one thousand nine hundred and fourteen both german and british forces laid down their weapons and took part in a game of football which was to be dubbed as the christmas truce
it is a <unk> which has inspired the premier <unk> successful educational program as well as a christmas television commercial for <unk> one of the uk's largest <unk>
but while many have been quick to embrace one of the <unk> most famous <unk> some historians have begun to raise questions over whether the legendary football match even took place at all
the <unk> <unk> of the famous match reported to have occurred came from <unk> williams a former soldier in the british army
he claimed that he had taken part in the match at <unk> in belgium during a television interview which was recorded in one thousand nine hundred and eighty three
the ball appeared from somewhere i don't know where but it came from their side it wasn't from our side that the ball came he said
they made up some goals and one fellow went in goal and then it was just a general <unk>
i should think there were about a couple of hundred taking part
i had a go at the ball
i was pretty good then at nineteen
everybody seemed to be enjoying themselves
there was no sort of ill will between us
there was no <unk> and no score no <unk> at all
it was simply a <unk> nothing like the soccer you see on television
the boots we wore were a <unk> those great big boots we had on and in those days the <unk> were made of <unk> and they soon got very <unk>
mark <unk> professor of modern british history at the center for war propaganda and society at the uk's university of <unk> believes the entire episode has been <unk> in the <unk> years
the notion of two sets of soldiers simply laying down their arms and <unk> out of the <unk> ready to play an organized game of football is not one he <unk> to
in fact he says there is no absolute hard <unk> evidence of a match taking place and says the event has been <unk> beyond recognition
i think it highly likely that someone somewhere did bring out a ball and a bit of a kick about took place but that is a long long way from saying it definitely happened and that it was anything like a formal match rather than just men <unk> a ball about a bit <unk> told cnn
there is a huge difference between a truce and <unk> and we have tended to put the two together
<unk> are very common in war and often involve both sides <unk> each other in order to carry out common tasks often burial of dead and <unk> of wounded
at christmas one thousand nine hundred and fourteen where the truce occurred most men took part in it in this <unk> manner rather than actively <unk> which is clearly much more romantic and appealing
it also made not the <unk> bit of difference to the wider <unk> of the armies it was clearly temporary and <unk> would obviously <unk>
the role of the football match has been <unk> into the public <unk> this year by both the english football association and the premier league who have produced educational programs for children and held a series of events to mark the one hundred th anniversary
the premier league set up its christmas truce tournament in two thousand and eleven and has held it each year since in <unk> belgium
the latest edition was held earlier this month with teams from across europe coming together to compete at the tournament for boys aged twelve and under
all twenty premier league teams from england were represented and were joined by clubs from belgium germany scotland france and <unk>
the two day competition which was won by <unk> ran alongside an extensive educational program created especially for the occasion
the participants visited one of the sites which is alleged to have hosted a football match during christmas one thousand nine hundred and fourteen while they also visited war <unk> and <unk> while learning what life was like in the <unk>
they also laid <unk> at the <unk> gate the memorial dedicated to the british and <unk> soldiers who died during battle
i think it's really important that young people learn their history and lesson that can be learned from events such as the war martin heather head of education at the premier league told cnn
being able to use the christmas truce element of the first world war is really important
it gives some really key messages around reconciliation friendship and respect
it's not about <unk> the <unk> of war far from it
it's about fantastic acts of humanity <unk> such horror
this is the fourth year we've held the tournament and each year they clubs and players become more and more engaged
it has been incredible to see how much these kids engage
i think we need to educate our future players and we can use football to educate younger players
we want to produce all round people
it's not just about what you create on the pitch it's about what you create off the pitch too
the modern player needs to be able to cope with both elements
the premier league has <unk> up with the english football association football league and british council to launch football remembers an education pack which was sent to thirty thousand schools in the united kingdom
a number of initiatives have been launched which have seen children design <unk> write <unk> and help record a version of uk pop act the <unk> all together now song which has been released across the uk
the project which officially began earlier this month will run until two thousand and eighteen to mark the end of the great war
teams from across the uk both professional and <unk> <unk> <unk> photos to social media with the hashtag <unk> in memory of those who fought and died in the war
richard <unk> the chief of executive of the premier league also unveiled a brand new football field for use in <unk> as a <unk> memorial
the three g pitch which is used by the residents of <unk> during the day and local belgian club <unk> <unk> at night and <unk> can also be hired by premier league clubs if they guarantee that they will provide an educational program while at the venue
one man who was present at the <unk> gate ceremony was <unk> <unk> <unk> the great <unk> of general <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
his great grandfather was in charge of the german forty th <unk> division which held the line at <unk> on christmas day one thousand nine hundred and fourteen
he spoke with the children and said that the program could prove crucial to providing a real insight into what happened during some of europe's <unk> days
i think you can't start early enough teaching children about the importance of friendship fair play and making friends across different cultures and those are tremendous values to <unk> at a very early age he said
if you can do that through a medium like football which is so important and so central to these boys i think that's really really great
it's a great project
it's about the attitude
if they become professional <unk> you are trying to learn from role models and if you can learn about good role models in history i think that's a good thing
also to have an <unk> on life that you say actually i am living quite a <unk> life at the moment i live in a period of peace which has now lasted for more than sixty years and for these guys it was probably just a day or two
so to recognize your own position and say i am enjoying something which these guys had for only two days before they maybe died that's an amazing educational experience
while there is no debate over the premier <unk> commitment to education nor the way the truce has been portrayed by the organization some historians believe the whole story has been <unk> <unk>
professor thomas <unk> author of the book <unk> first war and a visiting <unk> at harvard university says the truth <unk> somewhere in between
i think it is fair to say that the football matches that took place during christmas one thousand nine hundred and fourteen have both at times been <unk> and at other times been blown out of all <unk> <unk> told cnn
a number of independent reports and sources exist that report on football being played between german and british soldiers during christmas one thousand nine hundred and fourteen
i find it not credible to argue that they were all fabricated
after the war with millions of soldiers killed <unk> or missing it just was not <unk> to speak about <unk> <unk>
there is <unk> of evidence that subsequent generations tried to write not just <unk> german football matches but any kind of friendly encounter of enemy combatants out of the story after the event
at the same time people sometimes have also <unk> the importance of soccer games in one thousand nine hundred and fourteen by <unk> them and by <unk> the christmas truce as a <unk> where the war could still have been stopped
<unk> <unk> who co <unk> the book christmas truce with her colleague <unk> brown has also questioned the <unk> of the so called match
in the book she claims that the ground on christmas day was frozen destroyed by shells and <unk> with dead bodies
the football match has been <unk> blown up especially this year <unk> told cnn
while <unk> <unk> that there have been accounts of such an event particularly in the testimony provided by williams she remains skeptical claiming the ground would have been <unk> with dead bodies and shells while the land was frozen because of the cold weather
the event of the truce and <unk> over so much of the british sector of the line is what was so remarkable not the very few kick <unk> she added
football was a popular sport at the time in germany and britain and often played behind the lines when the men were at rest
the main activity during this truce was the opportunity to bury the dead which had been lying between the lines as well as talking and <unk> gifts
it was also a chance to work above ground to dig <unk> and build <unk> for both germans and british
the story has also been portrayed on television by <unk> one of the most prominent <unk> in the uk
its television commercial which shows a version of the christmas truce attracted seven hundred and twenty seven complaints but the advertising standards authority the country's governing body for such matters insisted there was no case to answer
in a statement the <unk> commented
we recognize that some have found the use of the first world war for advertising purposes to be <unk> the ad is not likely to break the rules surrounding serious harm or offense
we also considered that the ad is obviously <unk> from editorial content and therefore is not likely to <unk>
in a statement <unk> head of brand communications mark given said the commercial had been widely <unk> by viewers
we are very pleased that the <unk> have decided that there are no grounds to investigate our christmas <unk> he told cnn in a statement
we've been <unk> with the <unk> positive response we've had from customers and colleagues to our <unk> of the one thousand nine hundred and fourteen christmas day truce
we <unk> with the royal british legion in the twenty th year of our relationship with them to ensure we tell this story with authenticity and respect and to help raise awareness and additional funds for the important work they do
while questions remain over the historical <unk> of the football match and the truce there can be no doubt as to football's commitment to <unk> the fallen
the premier league and fa have run numerous events while individual clubs such as <unk> <unk> which played a huge role in the war under its former <unk> as <unk> <unk> have also marked the occasion with a number of <unk>
it was on december fifteen one thousand nine hundred and fourteen when the <unk> <unk> was formed and several players signed up join the army and fight against the german forces
many were killed during fighting while those who returned such as <unk> <unk> would go on to coach the english national side
while football's contribution to the great war is well documented the story of the football match during the truce of one thousand nine hundred and fourteen is relatively new in a historical sense
the truce seems to have been <unk> only since the one thousand nine hundred and sixty s chris <unk> author of the battle for <unk>
german defeat on the <unk> one thousand nine hundred and eighteen
no doubt the men who took part had it as a central part of their memory but it really does not seem to have featured much from one thousand nine hundred and fifteen to the one thousand nine hundred and sixty s
it was an important event and of course it is a very positive image but it was short affected only a small fraction of the four hundred miles of the western front and made no different to the way the war <unk>
while historians continue to debate over the actual <unk> of the legendary football match there can be little doubt of the impact that the educational program and its impact has had on the children fortunate enough to visit <unk>
hundreds of <unk> have visited war sites and <unk> while the players they watch each and every week in the premier league have also taken time to remember
if we can get young people to learn their history by using education and football then that will be fantastic added heather
we want those kids to look at the players from their own clubs who went out to fight in the first world war
we want them to know about those who died those who lived and came back to pursue a career or those who chose another path
we want them to learn about this legacy
late last year french prime minister manuel valls said his country had never faced a greater terrorist threat
officials tell cnn the threat of terrorist attack in the european union is greater than at any time since nine eleven because of the emergence of jihadist safe <unk> in syria and iraq
but no country faces a greater terrorist threat than france with support for isis running deep among disenfranchised immigrant communities in the <unk> crime ridden banlieues that surround many french cities
the numbers tell the story
three hundred and ninety french extremists are now fighting with jihadist groups in syria and iraq according to french officials with two hundred and thirty one believed to be on their way
fifty one have been killed in suicide bombings and combat
and two hundred and thirty four have left the conflict zone with one hundred and eighty five now back in france
since the summer of two thousand and thirteen french police say they have thwarted five terror plots
<unk> were <unk> in the run up to christmas after a knife attack in a police station in tours and car <unk> attacks in <unk> and nantes on three consecutive days
the tours attack was the only one of the three that was <unk> linked to islamist terrorism
a few days after posting an isis flag on his facebook page <unk> <unk> a french <unk> extremist entered a police station in the central french town of tours on <unk> twenty and stabbed several officers before being shot dead
isis has explicitly called for lone wolf terrorist attacks in france because of its participation in airstrikes in iraq by the u.s. led coalition
if you are not able to find an <unk> or a bullet then single out the <unk> american <unk> or any of their allies
<unk> his head with a rock or slaughter him with a knife or run him over with your car or throw him down from a high place or <unk> him or poison him isis spokesman abu muhammad al <unk> stated in an <unk> in september
on <unk> nineteen three french isis fighters appeared in a french language video put out by the group's propaganda arm <unk> the call for attacks in france
one of them stated
<unk> them and do not allow them to sleep due to fear and horror
there are weapons and cars available and targets ready to be hit
even poison is available so poison the water and food of at least one of the enemies of allah
kill them and <unk> in their faces and run over them with your cars
do whatever you are able to do in order to <unk> them for they deserve only this
a significant number of the nearly four hundred french nationals now fighting in syria and iraq are believed to have joined isis
that includes <unk> <unk> a twenty two year old convert from <unk> who french authorities suspect participated in the <unk> on camera beheading of more than a dozen members of the syrian armed forces in november <unk> by the british jihadi john
french officials have for some time been worried that those on their way back to france or already back in the country could launch attacks
in february police in cannes broke up an alleged plot to bomb targets in france by ibrahim <unk> a french algerian extremist who had allegedly just returned from fighting with isis in syria
police say they found almost a kilogram of the high explosive <unk> in his family's cannes apartment building
<unk> has denied the allegations against him
<unk> <unk> a french algerian isis fighter who allegedly helped guard western hostages in syria before returning to europe allegedly shot and killed four people at a jewish museum in brussels in may
<unk> was arrested in france and <unk> to face trial in belgium
he has denied the charges
in both the cannes and brussels plots investigators believe it is possible the men were acting on their own <unk>
no evidence has been publicly released suggesting isis leadership signed off on the plots
it is not just isis causing concern to french security officials
european counterterrorism officials tell cnn a relatively high number of french extremists have joined isis rival <unk> al nusra al qaeda's affiliate in syria
of most concern
david <unk> a french convert from <unk> who has emerged as one of the most skilled bomb makers in the <unk> group an al qaeda a team based in syria's <unk> province with ties to <unk> al nusra
u.s. officials tell cnn they believe <unk> has been working on <unk> explosive devices that the group hoped to <unk> on board western passenger aircraft and has been talent spotting european extremists in syria who can be trained for attacks in europe
<unk> was injured in a u.s. drone strike that hit a vehicle he was traveling in november
in november france adopted tough new anti terror legislation making it easier to shut down jihadist websites and <unk> passports and identity cards of those suspected of wanting to travel overseas to fight jihad
but critics say the french government has done too little to tackle one of the key contributing factors to radicalization
the deep sense of <unk> toward mainstream society felt by a significant number of young muslim immigrants in the banlieues
in the years after nine eleven france was held up as a model by many for its <unk> agenda and its zero tolerance of extremist radical <unk>
britain by contrast was criticized for a <unk> approach that for too long offered political refuge to extremists from around the world
but by the late two thousand s islamist extremism had also become a significant problem in france
although french leaders paid <unk> service to <unk> the concept was only <unk> for young unemployed muslims living in impoverished banlieues whose <unk> <unk> were more <unk> than their counterparts in the united kingdom
while france could <unk> down on radical <unk> in the one thousand nine hundred and ninety s it was powerless to prevent the growth of jihadist websites and social media in the second half of the two thousand s
jihad in syria has become a cause <unk> for french extremists able to access this content online
while many british extremists traveled to al qaeda's safe <unk> in afghanistan and pakistan in the years before and after nine eleven because of their language and <unk> ties to the region much of france's <unk> population <unk> from north africa making travel to jihadist <unk> in the arab world easier and more <unk>
senior <unk> and a team of medical staff from a chinese hospital in the northwestern province of <unk> have been punished for taking group photos next to apparently unconscious patients after surgery state media reported on monday
a series of photos recently circulated on <unk> weibo a chinese <unk> site shows chinese doctors and nurses <unk> in <unk> posing with reportedly unconscious patients on the operating table in the operating theater
a man makes a <unk> sign in one of the happy snaps while other doctors are seen <unk> over the patient mid procedure
the <unk> bureau of public health has taken action for the photos taken in august this year <unk> three top <unk> from administrative <unk> at the privately run <unk> hospital reported xinhua news agency
the other staff <unk> in the photos have been <unk> and <unk> three months pay
the hospital issued a public statement and apology explaining that the photos were taken to <unk> the last day that the operating theater was in use before it closed down in favor of new facilities
our staff members have neglected the possible negative consequences of their actions we will undergo an in depth review of the incident the statement reads
the photos have triggered a backlash on china's <unk> platforms
<unk> have taken to social media to express their opinions using the hashtag surgery selfie with many condemning the doctors lack of professional ethics
they are not acting <unk> at all
they are treating the patients suffering as a joke how can they even take a selfie at a time like this
one weibo user <unk> <unk> commented on a discussion <unk>
others expressed sympathy for the doctors
doctors are humans too
i don't think there is anything wrong with them wanting to take a photo to celebrate after a long and successful surgery
we should look at this <unk> instead of being limited by those so called restrictions another weibo user <unk> commented
north koreans ability to <unk> the internet for the few in the isolated nation who could ever really go online anyway is <unk> than ever
<unk> research reported on monday that the country's internet was down after twenty four hours of increasing instability
it stayed dead for more than nine hours then came back to life but not for long
half a day later <unk> said it was down again
then it was back up at about one a.m. wednesday pyongyang time the company said
but the <unk> of <unk> a company that monitors internet performance worldwide made earlier tuesday did not change
north korea continues its struggles to stay online
the timing of north korea's latest internet issues makes them significant
they come days after the u.s. government blamed pyongyang for being behind the hacking of sony pictures over that company's production of the interview a comedy depicting the assassination of north korean leader kim jong un as well as threats against anyone who <unk> watch the movie
north korea denied any responsibility even as it blamed the u.s. government for being behind the making of the seth rogen james <unk> film
its <unk> government went on to officially make its own threat warning the united states that its <unk> will be attacked <unk> the hacking attack on sony
pyongyang hasn't <unk> any blame or threats about its latest internet outage
but experts are skeptical that the american government had any involvement
that's almost <unk> said mike <unk> a frequent traveler to north korea and former cnn correspondent
the issue
is not whether it was or it wasn't
the issue is what the north koreans think it was said <unk> a u.s. china institute senior fellow
and i think it's safe to <unk> unless they themselves took their system <unk> for their own security which is not impossible they'll be looking to respond
expert
could be a fifteen year old in a guy <unk> mask
so who is behind north korea's internet problems
unlike the sony cyberattack and threats which were linked to a group called guardians of peace the latest issues haven't been tied to any group or government
it's possible they have nothing to do with the sony dust up and are simply an internal matter
another possibility
north korea's internet traffic is <unk> through china so issues or officials there may be to blame
another option
it could be a deliberate move by the country's own government
north korea may have <unk> themselves either <unk> to prevent that movie from being distributed but also probably more likely in a <unk> <unk> said <unk> henry a <unk> expert and former executive assistant director of the fbi
talking when north korea's internet was totally down <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> said usually there are isolated <unk> anyway in the country's service
but he thinks what happened here was different
i wouldn't be surprised if they are <unk> some sort of attack <unk> said
u.s. state department spokeswoman marie <unk> <unk> a question about the disruption
we aren't going to discuss you know publicly operational details about the possible response options or comment on those kind of reports in any way except to say that as we implement our <unk> some will be seen some may not be seen she said
no one is saying the u.s. government couldn't have carried out such an attack
but tech experts say it might not have needed to given the ability of anyone anywhere to do something like this
what happened with sony especially the <unk> decision to <unk> at least temporarily the release of the interview got a lot of people <unk>
matthew prince president of the performance and security company <unk> told cnn he couldn't say <unk> that there was an attack at all
but if there was he said it's possible a lone individual not an entire government was behind it
if it is an attack it's highly unlikely it's the united states
more likely it's a fifteen year old in a guy <unk> mask said prince <unk> the prospective attackers to those connected to or inspired by the <unk> movement anonymous
limited technology but not when it comes to hacking
do these <unk> equal outrage leaving north koreans unable to view gangnam style for the two <unk> plus time
have they been frustrated when they tried to check on the latest <unk> results for their <unk> teams or engage in heated <unk> about local national and international politics
no
there's a reason the committee to protect journalists ranks north korea second on its list of most <unk> countries
only a <unk> of ruling <unk> can go online <unk> leaving the public limited to a heavily monitored and <unk> network with no connections to the outside world according to the advocacy group
widespread computer technology overall isn't a reality in one of the world's poorest and according to many <unk> most <unk> countries
a two thousand and twelve report from <unk> south korea's internet development agency noted north korea then had only one thousand and twenty four <unk> addresses unique numbers assigned to every device that <unk> on to the internet in a country of about twenty five million people
that figure may not exactly reflect the current <unk> since for example people can use one <unk> address for several items but it's still <unk> by any modern measure
the united states has more than one point five billion <unk> addresses
still even if most north koreans aren't web savvy by design a dangerous handful of them may be
jang <unk> <unk> who claims he worked as a computer expert for north korea's government before <unk> seven years ago told cnn he thinks that pyongyang has one thousand eight hundred <unk> stationed around the world
he says even the agents themselves don't know how many others work for the secretive group called bureau one hundred and twenty one whose mission is to conduct cyberattacks against overseas and enemy states
an fbi investigation linked the malware infrastructure and techniques used by the guardians of peace in the sony attack to previous north korean cyberattacks
after that u.s. president barack obama called the hack an act of <unk> that was very <unk> very expensive though he stopped sort of calling it an act of war
the next question is
will kim in pyongyang say the same about his country's internet issues

in his annual christmas address to the <unk> at the vatican monday the pontiff warned that a church that doesn't try to improve is like a sick body
francis said suggested that it would be helpful to the vatican <unk> to have a <unk> of their illnesses beginning with this disease of feeling <unk> or <unk>
the <unk> of power he said could lead to people <unk> they are superior to others and not here for the service to others
francis warned against the disease of loss of compassion which he said <unk> those who have a heart of stone
those who lose their inner <unk> their <unk> and <unk> to hide behind their papers becoming like <unk> machines rather than men of god
this is dangerous to lose human <unk> so necessary in order to cry with those who cry and enjoy with those who enjoy the pope said
pope francis referred to the diseases of excessive planning and <unk> and of bad coordination which he said could occur when members did not <unk> with each other
there was also the risk of <unk> to spiritual <unk> disease and <unk> the story of <unk> he said warning that <unk> lost memory of their encounter with god
the pope described the diseases of <unk> and <unk> and <unk> those who try to court their <unk> inspired by their own <unk>
the disease of gossip francis said he had addressed before but <unk>
this is a serious disease that begins simply when people <unk> and it takes over the person turning the person as a <unk> and in so many cases people are speaking ill about their own colleagues and brothers and sisters
these people haven't got the courage to speak directly and they speak about others behind their backs he said
dear brothers let us be aware and guard against the terrorism of gossip
pope francis also appeared to speak to the child abuse scandal that has rocked the catholic church referring to it as the disease of a <unk>
this disease also begins from good <unk> but with the passing of time <unk> its members becoming a cancer which threatens the <unk> of the body and causes a lot of evil and scandal especially towards our small brothers and sisters francis said
finally francis warned against the disease of the <unk> of the <unk> when the <unk> <unk> his service in power
this is a disease of people who seek <unk> to <unk> power only aimed at <unk> and to <unk> and <unk> others he said
pope francis concluded
dear brothers such diseases and such <unk> are a naturally a danger for each christian and for each <unk>
for each community for any <unk> movement
they can damage both <unk> and the community
we have to say that only the holy spirit and the soul of christ only he can protect us from the disease
we have to cure ourselves of these
let us try to grow together and close to christ
in an interview with cnn's christiane amanpour that aired earlier this month veteran vatican <unk> <unk> <unk> said pope francis had been <unk> growing opposition within his own church
this was mainly due to francis efforts at reform since becoming pope in march two thousand and thirteen <unk> said
within the church there is a tough group of conservative bishops and <unk> and <unk> and also very <unk> bishops and <unk> who are practically against the pope who are working against the pope he said
they don't like what he wanted to do with the <unk> about family to give new <unk> to <unk> and <unk> people to get the <unk> or to have a new look on the <unk> union

now picture thirty three thousand people living there within the space of one city block
that was kowloon walled city once considered the <unk> settlement on earth
before it was <unk> twenty years ago photographer <unk> girard spent years with <unk> <unk> <unk> documenting this unique hong kong phenomenon and remembers being <unk> when he first saw it
it was a huge <unk> of buildings recalls girard
it didn't look like anything else
after all the walled city was a kind of historical accident
a former <unk> dynasty fortress it never fully came under the <unk> of the british colonial government in hong kong
as a result its residents were free to build their <unk> as they wished <unk> safety <unk>
quite often houses were built by building onto the next building punching out walls to use their <unk> said girard
a lot of them didn't have access to air or open space because they were <unk> in the center of the structure
deep within the <unk> darkness a variety of small businesses <unk>
the places that stuck out were the meat factories says girard
there were pig <unk> laying <unk> out on the floor
they'd burn the hair off with a <unk> it was all pretty open and of course there were no health laws governing the place
but despite the city's wild appearance the photographer found that the people inside lived just like people anywhere else
people were doing very ordinary things he says
it's just that all these ordinary things were happening in an extraordinary place
the complexity of the walled city also fascinated local architect <unk> tan now the director of hong kong firm research architecture design
a graduate student then he wrote his <unk> on the walled city as it was being torn down
i was fascinated it was like a piece of <unk> that worked very well
the <unk> was like taking the machine apart the first time you could see what was inside
it was a really <unk> process for me as a designer when we met this walled city we started to see that people could be more intelligent than us the designers that they could think of ways to solve problems that are outside the traditional academic world
tan was especially impressed by kowloon walled city's water system
to support its dense population residents dug extra <unk> and built thousands of <unk> that <unk> through the building
but since <unk> water to the city's roof tanks required plenty of power the people would take turns <unk> electricity so that water could be shared successfully
it revealed the community inside that no matter the challenges they would find some intelligent way to solve it says tan
despite the <unk> of the walled city by one thousand nine hundred and ninety four it was completely torn down by the city government which was eager to replace the chaotic and <unk> community with a public park
seeing the walled city fall into <unk> was sort of <unk> says girard
every city <unk> too late to start caring about their architectural heritage it's a mistake that gets repeated everywhere
by the time you start caring about it it's too late to save it
today visitors to the site of the old walled city will find a <unk> garden with <unk> trees and <unk> <unk>
in the park there is a small museum in honor of kowloon walled city
but when you look to the sky and imagine the <unk> of hong kong life that once stood it's easy to see that something significant has been lost

why we love the kowloon city neighborhood
the city is not dead
even today the city's legacy lives on
a walled neighborhood called the <unk> in the two thousand and five film <unk> begins was based on kowloon walled city
the city is even a level in the video game call of duty
black <unk>
because of the continued interest <unk> girard is working with his fellow kowloon walled city photographer <unk> <unk> to finish a new book of their stunning photographs entitled city of darkness
<unk>
you don't want to <unk> a slum you know
because it was that
but it was much more than that
the walled city was a kind of architectural <unk> in terms of what a city can be <unk> self generated <unk>
it was vital and vibrant and every part of it was being used
tan believes the spirit of the walled city continues to <unk> through the heart of hong kong itself
go to the peak and look down upon this amazing collection of buildings coming together it's almost like a blown up version of the walled city right
each building is related to the next building
new programs <unk> because of the connections
this <unk> chaos he says has been an inspiration for his own work
many architects and urban <unk> like control he says
but people like to get lost in the city
in my design process i always <unk> try to allow accidents to allow others to participate to surprise me

pirot serbia in the <unk> of a small house in pirot in southeastern serbia a handful of women are fighting to keep an ancient craft alive
their <unk> fingers race up and down large wooden <unk> weaving the <unk> <unk> patterns distinct to pirot carpets
once celebrated throughout europe for their beauty pirot carpets <unk> the walls and floors of serbian royal <unk> as well homes of the urban elite
<unk> for over four centuries in the town after which they were named pirot once a thriving trade center on the <unk> route between east and west they were <unk> <unk> out for state visits and given to foreign dignitaries
however what was a thriving craft practiced by five thousand weavers a century ago is now under threat of extinction with only ten women still keeping the tradition going
pirot carpet weaving is our treasure which is passed on from generation to generation
it's the knowledge i learned from my mother and my grandmother says <unk> ciric who founded the <unk> heart <unk> in pirot with local women in two thousand and nine to try to stop the skills <unk> throughout centuries from passing into <unk>
carpet weaving is in our dna she continues
we were born on carpets and we grew up in houses filled with pirot carpets
pirot carpets are very thin but extremely dense and are said to last more than a century
they have two <unk> sides and are <unk> protected which means that they can only be made in the pirot area and out of pirot <unk> a rare <unk> with only a few <unk> <unk> just two hundred and fifty <unk> remaining
weaving is <unk> work
it requires <unk> precision supreme skill and creativity in equal measure
everything is done by hand only and in the same way as hundreds of years ago
it takes two weavers working <unk> a month to create less than one square meter
traditionally a female activity young girls would start at the <unk> at the age of ten practicing every day for five years to reach a level considered good enough
their weaving skill had a great impact on their marriage prospects it was considered a measure of intelligence because of the knowledge of <unk> required to <unk> the size and distribution of patterns
when you look at a carpet with an <unk> eye you can see beautiful colorful patterns but we work out exactly how many of these patterns we can fit within a meter says ciric
we have to be <unk> and use <unk> to see where these patterns will stop and where the border of the carpet will connect and finish she adds
and if a <unk> makes a mistake the carpet is <unk> pulled apart even if the work was nearly completed
the concentration necessary for this kind of precise work often means that once a <unk> sits down at the <unk> she loses all sense of time
the pattern in a mysterious way simply <unk> her <unk> her into the depth and she's so taken by her work that everything around her stops
she <unk> about the time she <unk> herself to the pattern says ciric
and it's those patterns that give pirot carpets a <unk> <unk>
weavers say they represent ancient <unk> which carry magical <unk> and can be read as an image <unk> and there are ninety five <unk> which weavers have to <unk>
it is very mysterious but in every single carpet there is a story which you can read
when i see a carpet i can immediately tell whether it has been made now or in a different period whether it has been made with love or only to be sold says ciric
even though this skill is now practiced only by a handful of women ciric and her fellow weavers from <unk> heart are trying to pass it on to the next generation organizing winter <unk> for schoolchildren including boys
there is a new generation coming along and if we manage to pass on this knowledge to them i think there won't be any danger of this craft dying out says ciric
we are the guardians of the tradition of pirot carpet weaving and we do this with love

french interior minister bernard cazeneuve will head to nantes monday evening to meet with the families of the victims and rescue officials <unk> told cnn affiliate <unk> tv
the investigation is just beginning he said but so far the nantes prosecutor has said the incident appears to be an isolated case and not a terrorist attack
authorities are investigating a <unk> found with the attacker <unk> said
it was not immediately clear whether the incident was related to one sunday in <unk> france in which witnesses said a man shouting god is great in arabic rammed his vehicle into pedestrians
at least twelve people were injured by that vehicle said police in <unk> a city in eastern france
a man has been arrested in connection with the case they said
<unk> tv reported that <unk> heard the driver <unk> the phrase allahu akbar arabic for god is great
on saturday a man stabbed three police officers in central france while allegedly calling out the same phrase
french counterterrorism authorities are investigating that attack

on this sunny morning <unk> of <unk> and <unk> of <unk> fill the hot and <unk> air as would be expected in most schools around the world
but the source of fun is somewhat less expected farming

<unk> is new to the world of agriculture and has enjoyed <unk> her favorite crops this morning
i didn't know they were <unk> and now i know i eat them
in fact she <unk> them for <unk> along with the rest of her school
<unk> school is putting african traditions back on the menu in a new era of indigenous school <unk>
plants native to her home country tanzania are being <unk> as a result of an idea <unk> by people at the other end of the age <unk> retired women the <unk> estate senior women's group
modern people here in tanzania associate indigenous food with poverty and being poor says <unk> founder <unk> <unk> referring to the increasing popularity of fast food
native plants such as <unk> <unk> <unk> sweet <unk> and even the leaves of these latter two plants have high <unk> and <unk> value
but they're under <unk> by the communities in which they grow often dismissed as <unk>
one afternoon in two thousand and seven <unk> invited her senior <unk> for tea which was made from the leaves in her garden
that day her mission to save <unk> traditions began
and it began with children
we started working with schools to make sure <unk> grow up <unk> these vegetables says <unk> <unk> a <unk> founding member
the children learn by growing and <unk> the plants at school and go on to spread the word to their families and communities
they don't know most of the time especially people living in towns
the <unk> school at <unk> has over one thousand two hundred students all of whom appear to have come in at the <unk> of dawn to tend <unk> to their crops
there are groups of children <unk> land whilst others collect water from the well or <unk> around with <unk> <unk>

this is the atmosphere every morning i'm told

in the morning session normally we have time to clean the environment and take care of our garden says school <unk> <unk> <unk>
she has seen the impact the garden has had on the general health and well being of her <unk>
it increased school <unk> and reduced <unk> because the kids are happy to come in she says
<unk> currently works with ten schools in <unk> <unk> <unk> but hopes for the indigenous food movement to spread across the country
the need for improved <unk>
among the eight million children under five years old estimated to be living in tanzania forty two per <unk> are <unk> and sixteen per <unk> are <unk> according to unicef
levels of <unk> are also high with rates as high as forty one per <unk> in adult women
one cause of this is the increasing <unk> on staples such as <unk> and sweet <unk>
another cause is that locals have been eating more food high in fat and <unk> such as <unk>
plants with higher <unk> value including the leaves of the sweet <unk> plant seem to have been forgotten
improving <unk> is a national concern but for the women at <unk> their goal is to get people <unk> the food directly under their nose
in the villages most of these vegetables grow as <unk> says <unk> who worries that people don't even seem to use them when they have nothing to eat
by raising awareness into growing indigenous plants the team hope to get people <unk> these plants as year round sources of food on their <unk>
it's all in the taste
as <unk> <unk> around the community garden at the <unk> headquarters she <unk> shows the tens of <unk> <unk> growing there one of her favorite being the bitter <unk>

in recent years so much has been going on in the world of commercial aviation that putting together a top ten events forecast has been easy major new airplane programs have been announced airline <unk> has taken place and <unk> between china and europe over carbon emissions have held major airplane orders hostage
looking at the year ahead it's a challenge to muster a list of five events likely to grab the general <unk> attention much less ten
the year two thousand and fifteen is more about program execution
new airplanes from airbus and <unk> are scheduled to enter service in two thousand and fifteen and the airbus a three hundred and fifty <unk> scheduled for delivery to its first customer december twenty two will also see its eis in january
<unk> seven hundred and eighty seven s are in a <unk>
more than two hundred have been delivered and the next version the seven hundred and eighty seven ten isn't scheduled for delivery until two thousand and eighteen
<unk> is between airplanes so to speak
its new re <unk> e jet e two isn't scheduled for delivery until two thousand and eighteen and the current generation e jet <unk> on
yet even though they do lack the <unk> of years past there are still a handful of important events and <unk> to look forward to in two thousand and fifteen
the airbus a three hundred and twenty <unk> the new engine option and the <unk> <unk> are supposed to enter service in two thousand and fifteen
each is powered by the <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> fan a twenty year research and development gamble that brings <unk> back into the arena as a major player in single <unk> airplane <unk>
supposed to because new airplane programs from airbus boeing and <unk> have been <unk> with delays
so far the flight testing of the a three hundred and twenty <unk> which had its first flight in september seems to be going <unk> but <unk> can emerge
the a three hundred and twenty <unk> eis is scheduled for october
for <unk> eis of <unk> bet the company jump into the big <unk> with its first <unk> jet is an event that was originally supposed to happen in december two thousand and thirteen
then the fourth quarter of two thousand and fourteen
the first flight of the <unk> test program didn't happen until september two thousand and thirteen
the planned fourth quarter two thousand and fourteen eis may have been achieved had it not been for a major engine failure of <unk> <unk> during a ground test in may
the fault was <unk> to a <unk> designed oil <unk> and not the game changing engine architecture
the entire flight test fleet was <unk> for three months while the cause and a fix were identified
had <unk> been on time it would have been two years ahead of the a three hundred and twenty <unk>
now it'll be a <unk> up as to which airplane <unk> service first
according to the canadian investment bank <unk> analyst at <unk> <unk> should have its eis in october two thousand and fifteen
<unk> will only say the second half of two thousand and fifteen but <unk> a major <unk> on the <unk> <unk> and <unk> engine <unk> this down to the fourth quarter
no matter
eis for two airplanes in the same month or the same quarter or even the same year is a major industry event
for airbus the a three hundred and fifty <unk> the response to the boeing seven hundred and eighty seven and the challenge to <unk> <unk> seven hundred and seventy seven three hundred <unk> was set to be delivered december twenty two to launch customer qatar airways
the real flow of <unk> and service entry begins in january
more
first look inside the airbus a three hundred and fifty <unk>
the price per barrel of oil dropped dramatically in two thousand and fourteen
it'll probably continue to fall in two thousand and fifteen
some believe the price could hit forty dollar a barrel
if so it probably won't stay there for long before <unk> to sixty dollar eighty dollar and maybe back to one hundred dollar
don't expect any order <unk> or <unk> because of lower oil prices
the lower oil prices may give new short term life to some older airplanes like the boeing seven hundred and fifty seven seven hundred and sixty seven seven hundred and seventy seven and seven hundred and forty seven four <unk> and airbus a three hundred six hundred <unk> and early a three hundred and thirty s. but that's about it
don't look for lower <unk> driven by cheaper oil either
airline management knows this is a time to <unk> <unk> that are elusive in a high oil price environment
as always international air shows are huge industry and media events
this coming year the paris air show is in june and the dubai air show is in november
unlike the air shows of recent years at which airplane program launches were announced the big four airplane <unk> airbus boeing <unk> <unk> have <unk> out their new airplane launches
paris and dubai will focus more on commercial airplane orders than anything else and even these are expected to be off compared with previous years
the peak of the order cycle has come and gone and for the moment we're on the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> especially with oil prices falling and reducing the urgency to place more orders
besides with airbus and boeing <unk> out to two thousand and twenty there are few <unk> available for which to place orders
<unk> the france based <unk> <unk> <unk> with more than eighty percents of the market might <unk> a major <unk> of its <unk> <unk> forty two seventy two series with a new engine new wing and other systems but <unk> <unk> command neither the market size nor the headlines of the big jets
an <unk> new engine option while important to the airlines won't capture the imagination of the air show or reporters
<unk> c nine hundred and nineteen the challenger to the airbus a three hundred and twenty and boeing seven hundred and thirty seven families is in development and so is the equivalent <unk> <unk> twenty one but neither will take to the skies in two thousand and fifteen
the <unk> <unk> <unk> twenty one is supposed to enter service in two thousand and fifteen after a seven year delay and this time it actually might do so
but only a few have been sold outside of china and prospects that there will be more orders are <unk>
the airplane is largely a learning effort by the chinese on how to develop an airliner and the experience has been painful
the <unk> <unk> ninety japan's first commercial airliner since the one thousand nine hundred and sixty s is set to enter flight testing in two thousand and fifteen
more
after fifty years japan set to launch a new commercial passenger plane
the real <unk> <unk> will watch for the flight testing of the boeing <unk> forty six a aerial <unk> <unk> for the u.s. air force
the airplane based on the commercial boeing seven hundred and sixty seven two hundred <unk> is already late and approaching one point five billion dollar over budget
its first flight was supposed to be last fall
now it's planned for this spring
or maybe before
even boeing and the air force aren't sure when the bird will fly
boeing won the <unk> in a bitter bitter fight with airbus which proposed its a three hundred and thirty <unk>
although not without its own challenges the <unk> is in service in britain and australia and has been ordered by several other global air forces

as part of the most significant diplomatic breakthrough between the united states and cuba in more than fifty years a prisoner swap was made
to <unk> its part of the bargain the u.s. released three cuban spies including <unk> hernandez the head of the spy ring known as the <unk> network
hernandez had an <unk> to <unk> smile wednesday as he arrived at havana's jose <unk> international airport
state tv showed hernandez as he was greeted by president raul castro and then embraced and <unk> his wife <unk> perez
cubans watching the <unk> coverage of the prisoner swap were shocked when the cameras <unk> in on hernandez <unk> perez
she was obviously in the late <unk> of a <unk> that had no easy explanation
not only had hernandez been serving a double life sentence but his wife also worked for cuba's intelligence services and was banned by u.s. officials from visiting her husband in prison according to the cuban government
the subject became the immediate hot topic in havana where rumors <unk> fast about the <unk> <unk> and whether the cuban government could have somehow <unk> a <unk> <unk> visit under the nose of u.s. authorities
the couple appeared at another event on saturday where together with the other freed spies castro and the communist island's top political and military officials <unk> them with <unk>
a <unk> hernandez stood by perez whose round stomach was clearly visible for viewers of the live broadcast
as the couple left the celebration hernandez <unk> at the secret surrounding the <unk>
<unk> asking and we have had a lot of fun with the comments and <unk>
the reality is it had to be kept quiet hernandez told the government run television channel
we can't give a lot of details because we don't want to hurt people who meant well
he said his wife's <unk> was a direct result of the high level talks
one of the first things <unk> by this process was this hernandez said <unk> to his <unk> stomach
i had to do it by remote control but everything turned out well
two sources involved with the diplomatic talks when questioned by cnn <unk> the mystery
during the negotiations <unk> <unk> was collected and sent to cuba where perez was <unk> <unk>
the u.s. justice department confirmed the story without going into the details
we can confirm the united states <unk> <unk> <unk> request to have a baby with her husband spokesman brian <unk> said
what the u.s. would gain
why would the u.s. government do this
the artificial <unk> was made possible in exchange for better conditions for alan gross a u.s. contractor imprisoned in cuba
gross was released last week as part of the prisoner swap
in light of mr. <unk> two life sentences <unk> said the request was passed along by <unk> patrick <unk> who was seeking to improve the conditions for mr
gross while he was imprisoned in cuba
the <unk> on both sides makes sense
for eighteen months officials from both countries refused to admit that they were even holding high level talks
officials <unk> via back channels knowing that any leak about the talks could <unk> the talks
<unk> perez involved cutting through <unk> red tape at multiple u.s. government agencies
as perez began to show officials from both countries <unk> over how they would explain her <unk> and what to do if the baby arrived before the talks succeeded
hernandez was convicted in two thousand and one of conspiracy to commit murder for his role in the brothers to the rescue shoot down that left four cuban americans dead after cuban air force <unk> blew up the two civilian planes as they flew toward havana to distribute anti government <unk>
he received two life sentences
cuban authorities said hernandez and the other operatives were trying to prevent terrorist attacks from being carried out on their homeland by violent miami exiles
that the u.s. government helped a man convicted of plotting the murder of four cuban americans and <unk> on the exile community in miami will likely further <unk> many of the same cuban americans who were already <unk> that washington is <unk> diplomatic relations with havana
but <unk> <unk> an aide to <unk> who worked to <unk> the landmark agreement with cuba said helping hernandez <unk> a child led to better treatment for gross by cuban authorities and was an important <unk> to help reach a historic deal
the <unk> was that this man would die in prison
this was her only chance of having a child <unk> told cnn
<unk> hernandez said he and his wife are expecting their baby daughter to arrive in two weeks and they will name her <unk>
mosul iraq's second largest city was taken by isis in a <unk> like <unk> in june
todenhoefer managed to visit the mosque there where the leader of isis abu bakr al <unk> gave his only public address
and he saw the <unk> of daily life under isis with all shops having to close for prayers in the middle of the day
there is an awful sense of <unk> in mosul todenhoefer said in an exclusive interview with cnn
one hundred and thirty thousand christians have been <unk> from the city the shia have fled many people have been murdered and yet the city is <unk> and people actually like the stability that the islamic state has brought them
nonetheless he says there is an air of fear among residents
of course many of the them are quite scared because the punishment for breaking the islamic state's strict rules is very severe
according to isis's leadership the group's fighters managed to take mosul with only about three hundred men even though more than twenty thousand iraqi army soldiers were stationed there when the attack was launched
todenhoefer spoke with several isis fighters who took part in the operation
it took us about four days to take mosul a young fighter told him
so you were only about three hundred men and you defeated twenty thousand troops in four days
todenhoefer asked
well we didn't attack them all at once we hit their front lines hard also using suicide attacks
then the others fled very quickly the fighter explained
we fight for allah they fight for money and other things that they do not really believe in
todenhoefer told cnn the enthusiasm the isis militants showed was one thing that stood out
when we stayed at their recruitment house there were fifty new fighters who came every day todenhoefer said
and i just could not believe the <unk> in their eyes
they felt like they were coming to a promised land like they were fighting for the right thing
these are not <unk> people
one of the people we met had just finished his law degree he had great job offers but he turned them down to go and fight
we met fighters from europe and the united states
one of them was from new jersey
can you imagine a man from new jersey traveling to fight for the islamic state
he went on to say that one of isis's main points of strength is their fighters willingness even their will to die on the battlefield
todenhoefer met one somewhat <unk> recruit in a safe house who said he wears a suicide belt to every battle because he is too <unk> to run away if he is <unk> and would choose to blow himself up rather than be captured
isis also has a track record of <unk> <unk> and executing prisoners of war
todenhoefer was briefly able to speak to a kurdish captive while in mosul
the captive claimed he had not been <unk> but todenhoefer said he found that hard to believe
this was a broken man todenhoefer said
it was very sad to see a person in this state
he was just very weak and very afraid of his captors
todenhoefer conducted the interview with the prisoner while several isis fighters stood guard
he asked the man whether he knew what would happen to him
i do not know the captive told him
my family does not even know i am still alive
i hope that maybe there will be some sort of prisoner exchange
todenhoefer was also taken to see child soldiers <unk> with islamic state gear and brandishing ak forty seven s. one of the boys seemed very young but claimed he had already gone to battle for isis
how old are you
todenhoefer asked
i am thirteen years old the boy replied though he looked even younger than that
one of the most remarkable episodes of <unk> trip to the isis controlled region came when he was able to conduct an interview with a german fighter who spoke on behalf of isis's leadership
the man clearly <unk> about the group's <unk> vowed there was more to come
he also issued a warning to europe and the united states
so you also want to come to europe
todenhoefer asked him
no we will <unk> europe one day the man said
it is not a question of if we will <unk> europe just a matter of when that will happen
but it is certain
for us there is no such thing as borders
there are only front lines
our expansion will be <unk>
and the europeans need to know that when we come it will not be in a nice way
it will be with our weapons
and those who do not convert to islam or pay the islamic tax will be killed
todenhoefer asked the fighter about their treatment of other religions especially shia muslims
what about the one hundred and fifty million shia what if they refuse to convert
todenhoefer asked
one hundred and fifty million two hundred million or five hundred million it does not matter to us the fighter answered
we will kill them all
the interview became <unk> when they reached the topic of beheadings and enslavement especially of female captives
so do you seriously think that beheadings and enslavement actually signal progress for humanity
todenhoefer asked
slavery absolutely signals progress the man said
only ignorant people believe that there is no slavery among the christians and the jews
of course there are woman who are forced into prostitution under the worst circumstances
i would say that slavery is a great help to us and we will continue to have slavery and beheadings it is part of our religion
many slaves have converted to islam and have then been freed
the isis spokesman blamed the beheading of captured western journalists and aid workers on the policies of the united states
people should really think about the case of james foley he said
he did not get killed because we started the battle
he got killed because of the <unk> of his government that did not give him any help
even with recent gains by kurdish forces against isis in northern iraq todenhoefer sees the extremist group as <unk> building state institutions and that it shows no sign of losing its grip in the main areas it controls in iraq and syria
i think the islamic state is a lot more dangerous than western leaders realize he said
they believe in what they are fighting for and are preparing the largest religious <unk> campaign the world has ever seen

u.s. officers shot a canadian man who walked toward a border inspection <unk> waving what they said looked like a handgun early sunday
u.s. customs and border protection said in a statement that the man stopped his car around three a.m. near a <unk> on the ambassador bridge which goes between detroit and the canadian city of <unk>
as he walked toward them with what appeared to be a black handgun the officers ordered him to drop the weapon the statement said
when he pointed it in their direction they opened fire
officials at first said the man they shot had been waving a handgun
but investigators later determined that the man was holding a <unk> of a handgun u.s. customs and border protection spokesman <unk> <unk> said
authorities have not released the identity of the man who they described as a canadian citizen
he was shot in the arm treated for his injuries and then taken into custody <unk> said
citing <unk> police cnn partner <unk> said the man has had previous encounters with canadian law enforcement and confronted police officers minutes before the shooting on the bridge
after receiving a call reporting a man with a gun in the parking lot of a <unk> near the border around two forty a.m. <unk> police officers arrived at the scene and ordered the man to drop his weapon police said
according to police the man said why haven't you shot me yet
then he got back in his vehicle and drove away

<unk> louis is the host of inside city hall a <unk> political show on <unk> one a new york all news channel
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author
we don't yet know what <unk> <unk> of mental <unk> led <unk> <unk> to <unk> on a <unk> rampage that <unk> with the barbaric execution style killing of <unk> officers <unk> liu and <unk> <unk> on a new york city street
but the <unk> actions could not have happened at a worse time for a city already <unk> in a bitter public battle over police community relations
it's very possible that an important debate about race policing and the proper use of force will be buried along with the <unk> officers
weeks of street protests over a grand <unk> decision not to indict police officers who killed eric garner along with mayor bill de <unk> statements in sympathy with the goals of the demonstrators had already <unk> police <unk>
even before the slaying of the officers a war of words between de blasio and union leaders had grown <unk> bitter prompting new york's most prominent cleric <unk> <unk> <unk> to publicly call on both sides to <unk> down the rhetoric
the call for <unk> hadn't <unk> much in the way of results the <unk> continued to <unk> the mayor and a street demonstration earlier this month for the first time turned violent with a pair of police officers beaten on the brooklyn bridge
it's not a time for political analysis said a <unk> de blasio at a press conference saturday shortly after meeting with the families of the slain officers
the mayor appeared shaken in part because while entering the hospital where the dead officers bodies lay he passed through a <unk> of dozens of officers who <unk> turned their backs on him instead of <unk>
de <unk> call for a temporary halt to political warfare didn't stop his <unk> from going on the attack
typical of the criticism was a twitter message from former gov
george pataki a republican who has been floating trial balloons about a possible run for president
pataki pronounced himself <unk> by these barbaric acts which sadly are a <unk> outcome of <unk> anti <unk> rhetoric of eric holder and mayor de blasio
the statement is <unk> to say the least
neither pataki nor anybody outside the <unk> profession has the <unk> idea why <unk> shot his girlfriend traveled hundreds of miles to new york randomly killed two <unk> and then took his own life
<unk> claiming that the mayor and attorney general led <unk> to murder by mere words raises a question pataki can't possibly answer
which <unk> exactly made it all happen
an even harsher tone came from police union leaders
there is blood on many hands tonight said the president of the <unk> <unk> association patrick lynch
those that <unk> violence on the street in the <unk> of protest that tried to tear down what new york city police officers did every day
we tried to <unk> it must not go on it shouldn't be <unk>
that blood on the hands starts on the steps of city hall in the office of the mayor
watching the turmoil on television you'd never know that new york is on track to register the lowest number of murder and other serious crimes since the city began tracking numbers in the one thousand nine hundred and sixty s. the city has never been safer but rarely has it seemed so divided and angry
both sides are guilty of excess and poor judgment
<unk> <unk> about legitimate policy differences have been <unk> <unk> the new york daily news said in a recent editorial condemning the union president for circulating a form officers can complete that asks de blasio not to attend their funerals if they end up killed in the line of duty
the mayor who has openly supported the sentiment of demonstrators protesting the police killing of garner made mistakes of his own
de blasio should have issued a harsh <unk> to activists who recently marched through the streets <unk> shoot back
and what do we want
dead cops
the mayor should have agreed to <unk> demand that protest leaders <unk> and publicly <unk> such violent rhetoric
can things get worse
yes they can
in one thousand nine hundred and ninety two cops <unk> at then mayor david <unk> <unk> a rally at city hall that turned into a near riot with ten thousand officers taking over a bridge <unk> on cars and <unk> and <unk> at superior officers and elected officials
we haven't reached that point in new york yet
but these are dark troubled times in an urban center where twenty years of dedicated effort by police and community have mostly <unk> the true common enemy the city's criminals who are surely enjoying the <unk> that allows them to <unk> in our divided city
these seemingly <unk> questions have <unk> into a bitter <unk> on the catholic <unk> where a battle of <unk> <unk> has <unk>
religious scholars versus the so called <unk> who have earned <unk> dollar <unk> to build <unk> for the new millennium
to <unk> italian photographer <unk> di martino looked to find meaning in these newly built houses of god
i wanted to photograph new but already established churches from this millennium
but i had to explain to a lot of people that i wasn't documenting the <unk> of the catholic church or even the loss of <unk> but how these churches have now become part of the establishment he said
from <unk> to rome di martino <unk> through cities where celebrity architects hoped their designs would add to italy's great architectural landscape
photographing the works of architectural <unk> such as <unk> <unk> mario <unk> richard <unk> <unk> <unk> and others di martino explored whether there is a historical <unk> with the traditions of <unk> <unk> da <unk> and other artistic <unk> whose religious <unk> helped build some of the world's greatest <unk>
di martino used a formal approach photographing these churches from an <unk> perspective
his camera takes a <unk> position to allow the architectural <unk> to get fair play
photography he hoped could translate the <unk> decisions behind some very controversial and expensive designs that to some people are <unk> as churches
in <unk> which hosts the holy <unk> di martino photographed <unk> church of <unk> <unk>
standing in what was a <unk> <unk> factory the church has received endless <unk> by design experts around the world
but it has also been criticized by vatican members and religious scholars who say they are extremely <unk> <unk> of spiritual <unk> and <unk> from the catholic <unk>
at the other end of the discussion these new architects are building a new vision for the future
<unk> work is often called revolutionary and genius and some have put it in the company of le <unk> and <unk>
the <unk> of the issue
is there a <unk> with the past
does it follow the catholic <unk> norms defined by <unk> for what is a church
in an online interview <unk> acknowledged the struggle
to build a church nowadays is to come face to face with <unk> history and whether i like it or not i find myself these historical issues he said
di martino said that when he stood outside photographing these churches he rarely got a positive response
i know you can't build <unk> churches today but there is definitely a <unk> between the <unk> and the ideas of these architects di martino said
the big issue is that we are in search of a model that can represent our era
and we haven't found one
vatican officials have <unk> out against what they see as a <unk> from <unk> on how to build a church according to catholic <unk>
these laws however have been subject to interpretation
the diocese of <unk> for instance <unk> its decision to stand by <unk> design claiming it <unk> to catholic <unk> on <unk>
the seven tower church with <unk> is a symbolic play on the use of natural light in ritual and <unk>
the industrial looking church complex <unk> in with the area associated with <unk> working class
to the common eye these towers may seem more like giant <unk> a reference to the industrial working class area
photographing inside this <unk> building is a different story
<unk> tradition is <unk> but only slightly
di martino photographs the <unk> image of the holy face a half cross by the <unk> every element <unk> by natural light
a possible <unk> that god is <unk> in the digital age
in rome <unk> was tasked to build a church in the city's somewhat <unk> outskirts of rome in an area called <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> like a white <unk> amid tired tower blocks and parking lots <unk> <unk> church is simple and reflects light like other <unk> buildings
it is a clean clear cut design
but where is the <unk> <unk> and other elements that help <unk> catholics in this era of <unk> architecture
di martino who said his style is really <unk> has great interest in social issues
photographing modern buildings makes sense in his body of work he said
i approach architecture in the same way
i am interested in how man is placed in this design even though i photograph these buildings without people he said
they are not there but i still like to <unk> their story
<unk> di martino is an italian photographer based in milan

the controversial auction held inside the dallas convention center on a <unk> saturday evening in january sparked a <unk> debate over the best way to protect the species that has been brought to the edge of extinction because of humans appetite for its horn which is used for <unk> <unk> and in asia traditional medicine
the auction became so heated that both knowlton and the auction organizers feared for their safety after receiving <unk> of death threats that were investigated by the fbi
the dallas safari club sponsored the auction and <unk> it as a fundraising effort to help save the endangered species in africa
<unk> dot <unk> and knowlton said the auction was done in the name of conservation to save the threatened black rhinoceros
all proceeds were to be donated to the namibian government and <unk> for conservation and anti poaching efforts according to club officials and the namibian ministry of environment and tourism
animal welfare groups strongly oppose the <unk> conservation approach and call the kill it to save it rationale <unk> and outrageous
in spring knowlton applied for a permit from the u.s
fish and wildlife service that would enable him to import the trophy parts of the <unk> body at the <unk> of the hunt in namibia
the hunt would be organized and <unk> by the namibian authorities
in my opinion i thought it would have happened by now knowlton told cnn in an exclusive interview when asked if he was surprised that the permit process has taken so long
knowlton said he is waiting to see what will happen with the permit request before he makes his decision whether to move forward with the hunt
namibia wants us to come and participate in the hunt desperately knowlton said
the entire point of the auction in the united states was to be able to import the <unk> the remains of the black rhino into the united states
that's why they had the auction here in the hopes that it would bring more money to conservation than the previous permits they have sold in namibia
in addition to <unk> the rhino trophy knowlton also plans to distribute the rhino meat to namibian villages after the hunt
the endangered species act requires the u.s
fish and wildlife service to determine that the import will <unk> the species survival and not be <unk> to the survival of the species
the act also requires that any <unk> authorized activity may not <unk> the continued survival of the species in any way
the service looks closely at the individual circumstances of each import application including the <unk> of the species its current status in and beyond the country where the hunt will take place and the threats it may be facing as well as the overall management program for the species in that country where the funds for the hunt will go and how they will be used said <unk> <unk> chief of public affairs for the u.s
fish and wildlife service
the u.s
fish and wildlife service said it received over fifteen thousand public comments <unk> the permit in the thirty day allocated comment period on its federal register which closed on december eight
many of the comments were <unk> or near <unk> form letters arguing to save the last of the black rhinos
from american trophy <unk> <unk> and <unk>
<unk> said all the comments will be examined for <unk> information and was unable to provide a time frame for when the service will make a decision on the permit
animal <unk> estimate there are five thousand black rhinos in the world about two thousand and twenty of which are in the southern africa nation
they are considered a critically endangered species by wildlife organizations around the world
dr. michael <unk> chairman of the international union for conservation of nature african and asian rhino specialist groups said the namibian black rhino populations have been performing very well growing at a very healthy seven percents per year thanks to conservation efforts
in population terms it's of minor significance as we are talking about one old <unk> that would have contributed <unk> to the rhino population already
in monetary terms it's important as it <unk> funds that go directly into the wildlife products fund that <unk> one hundred percents back into rhino conservation <unk> said
knowlton stressed that the rhinos picked for hunting have no benefit to the population at large and are in fact a <unk> to the population
the animals chosen are <unk>
at the end of their life
they are not going to help the <unk> of the black rhino species in any way
this way there is a chance that the death of that animal helps the entire species
knowlton said by raising money from hunters like himself the namibian government can use the money for much needed anti poaching resources and habitat <unk>
but <unk> one animal for the greater good of the endangered species is a move that critics and animal conservation groups call <unk> and a sad joke
they need to be protected not sold to the highest <unk> said jeffrey <unk> of the international fund for animal welfare
it's a <unk> to say that this is being done for conservation <unk> said
it's saying the <unk> of this animal is worth more dead than alive
several groups such as <unk> argue it would be better to use these rhinos to promote wildlife viewing and <unk> by <unk> people for the experience of seeing one of these ancient <unk> up close in the wild
it also sends a dangerous message that these iconic and disappearing animals are worth more as dead <unk> to be mounted and hung on a wall in a texas <unk> than living in the wild in africa <unk> said
namibia was the first african country to <unk> protection of the environment into its constitution and said its conservation program has contributed to it having the largest free roaming population of black rhinos in the world
the dallas safari club obtained the hunting permit from the namibian government which would <unk> every aspect of <unk> <unk>
it's the first time a black rhino hunting permit has been <unk> outside the country
in recent years the namibian ministry of environment and tourism which <unk> the protection of the black rhinos has allowed three permits a year
in a two thousand and thirteen letter to the dallas safari club the namibian government said to hunt a black rhino is not taken lightly by namibia
only old <unk> <unk> which are marginalized in the population and do not contribute to <unk> are trophy <unk>
it really is a <unk>
the biggest threat to these massive <unk> is poachers across the african continent
rhino horns are lucrative on the black market
in asia where there are claims it can treat everything from headaches and food <unk> to <unk> and cancer horns can fetch up to sixty thousand dollar per kilogram putting the value somewhere between gold and pure <unk>
in the one thousand nine hundred and eighty s the black rhino population had <unk> to just a few dozen
conservation efforts have slowly helped increase <unk> numbers but poachers are still a threat
<unk> <unk> chief executive officer of the save the rhino trust in namibia which works with the government to fight poachers said the group has tried to <unk> the namibian government to stop <unk> hunting permits
but a poor african country like namibia where the world bank estimates the gross per capita income to be less than six thousand dollar struggles to fund conservation efforts <unk> said
it's difficult for the government to ignore the chance to raise so much money so quickly
i really believe every rhino counts said <unk>
it really is a <unk>
but i really struggle to say i'm saving rhinos and then say that one can be <unk>
knowlton hosts the hunting show <unk> on the outdoor channel and he also <unk> high end hunting adventures around the world
he described himself as a passionate <unk> and stressed that animal lovers should research the facts before having emotional reactions
there is no doubt in his mind that what he is doing is extremely important in helping the black rhino species in the long run
the namibian government is looking at it in a sustainable way
and i believe hunters at large are looking at it as a way to maintain a population in a sustainable way

i have always battled for transparency and this is a step in the right direction
let us hope that the report can now be published as quickly as possible
the credibility of fifa depends on it
the move comes just days after garcia resigned from his role citing a lack of leadership at the top of world football's governing body
garcia quit following fifa's <unk> of his appeal after he had launched a complaint about how his report had been <unk> by <unk> <unk> <unk> fifa's independent ethics judge
i <unk> with the appeal committee's decision said the american lawyer now chairman of the <unk> chamber of the fifa ethics committee in a public statement
it now appears that at least for the foreseeable future the <unk> decision will stand as the final word on the two thousand and eighteen and two thousand and twenty two fifa world cup bidding process
no independent governance committee investigator or <unk> panel can change the culture of an organization
blatter said he was surprised by <unk> resignation but that the work of the ethics committee will nonetheless continue
pending the election of a new chairman of the ethics committee by the fifa congress the fifa executive committee will <unk> an acting chairman to serve as a <unk> for mr garcia added blatter who will be at fifa <unk> meeting in <unk> on thursday and friday
<unk> decision to leave his role came following months of frustration for the new york attorney
in september when he completed his report he spoke out and declared that it should be made public but with <unk> to ensure witness <unk> was not <unk>
fifa rejected his request on the grounds that witness <unk> for his work could prove difficult to sustain if the report was published and threatened to <unk> him for his <unk>
then <unk> published his summary prompting garcia to respond by saying the german <unk> forty two page report contained numerous <unk> <unk> and erroneous <unk>
fifa has been under increasing pressure from the media and football fans to publish the report and embrace a period of reform
<unk> such as visa and <unk> <unk> have both gone public with their <unk> over fifa's lack of transparency while sony will not be <unk> its deal when it ends at the end of this year
widespread <unk> over the way russia and qatar won the rights to host the next two <unk> remain despite both countries being cleared of any wrongdoing by <unk> summary
both russia and qatar have always denied they were involved in any wrongdoing during the bidding process
the outcome of the vote is unlikely to <unk> <unk> chances of <unk> the presidency when the elections are held in may
blatter who is seventy eight is <unk> to win a fifth term in office and faces little opposition with votes from asia africa and south america already assured
uefa has yet to publicly back a candidate but it has <unk> itself from the bid by <unk> <unk> <unk> the only man to have publicly announced his plan to stand against blatter
<unk> <unk> the uefa president has ruled out running against blatter but there is now a race against time for his organization to thrown their weight behind a candidate
one option for uefa would be prince ali bin al hussein the jordanian prince who is also a vice president of fifa
al hussein is one of the most forward thinking members of the <unk> and publicly backed the publishing of the report
yet al hussein could be thwarted by his own <unk> by the asian football <unk> which has already pledged its support to blatter
if al hussein is unable to secure the support of his own <unk> it would mean his challenge would be over before it had even begun

your guide to the garcia games
one
i don't speak german
and two
there's a heavy <unk> nazi population in the area freeman told cnn over the phone last week
i'm black so traveling to that part of germany was well very <unk> he said with a <unk>
a generation ago when it was part of the former east germany <unk> was held up as an example of a communist <unk>
but when the berlin wall fell in one thousand nine hundred and eighty nine and germany reunited a year later economic reform began <unk> the city of seventy two thousand
first jobs began disappearing then so did the residents
many left town looking for better opportunities
in one thousand nine hundred and ninety one <unk> attacked the homes of hundreds of immigrant workers there including <unk> and africans the new york times reported
authorities were forced to evacuate the terrified <unk> to a military base
by the time freeman arrived last year its population had <unk> to just thirty five thousand
he wanted to document the residents painful economic struggle to survive
initially he thought he'd tell the story through the eyes of one displaced family
but when i got there i found the issue was much bigger freeman said
everyone was going through it
so freeman <unk> his editorial <unk> and painted a <unk> landscape of a larger issue
it wasn't simply residents survival at stake
the very existence of the town itself was clearly in <unk>
several residents were moved out of their homes to make room for a coal mining operation
one of <unk> favorite photos shows an odd <unk> <unk> in a window showing happy residents smiling inside their <unk> homes
it <unk> this perfect couple and a perfect world when it really wasn't perfect freeman said
the town felt <unk> he said like i was in some sort of horror film
almost always freeman and his german guide traveled around the city on <unk>
at one point they found themselves <unk> by a group of men at a <unk>
they stepped in front of us and did the whole <unk> hitler putting their hands up and talking in german freeman recalled
his guide stepped in and began speaking with the men
there was an argument and they told us to get out of their way freeman said
there was a lot of <unk>
finally they moved and continued <unk> things as we <unk> away
thinking back it's like how did i do that
he <unk>
freeman first fell in love with photography during his high school days in atlanta after his best <unk> father <unk> him a small point and shoot camera
once he started playing with it he couldn't put it down
<unk> <unk> with creating images led to a question which later became a goal
how can i make a living as a photographer
a college degree and <unk> at the new york times led to his current position as a photographer for new york mayor bill de blasio
it's really cool
i feel like the job presents different challenges that don't exist in newspaper and other forms freeman said
you have to find a way to make photographing someone at a <unk> interesting
one day he hopes to have a freelance photo video company where he can focus on his true passion
portraits
that's really what i love to do just capturing someone's character in one frame freeman said
i find it very character revealing
it's very <unk>
<unk> freeman is an american photographer based in new york city
you can follow him on facebook twitter <unk> and instagram
because of the reality star and her naked <unk> we heard the phrase break the internet more than we would have <unk> in two thousand and fourteen
of course no one thing actually broke it but here are ten of the <unk> and <unk> that tried
of course we have to start with this one but what is really left to say
she did her <unk> duty by posing <unk> and <unk> on the cover
what followed was an <unk> of <unk> <unk> with the <unk> <unk> <unk> being one of the most innocent
it was the fight watched round the world

this social media campaign got started in response to <unk> by <unk> <unk> who went on killing <unk> in <unk> <unk> california in may
his anger toward women sparked the hashtag women used to share their stories and thoughts on violence and <unk>
the <unk> ice <unk> challenge very quickly raised more than one hundred million dollar and awareness about <unk> <unk> <unk> often referred to as <unk> <unk> disease
hundreds of <unk> and thousands of <unk> <unk> posted videos of themselves being <unk> for the cause
according to google there were more than ninety million searches for the term in august
<unk> was everywhere from twitter to instagram and facebook
<unk> lee was just your typical sixteen year old working a part time job at target when a picture of him went viral after it was tweeted thanks to his <unk> <unk>
<unk> than you could say internet <unk> the kid was everywhere
based on a new york times profile he seems to have taken it all in <unk>
the hashtag has exploded since the <unk> of george zimmerman in the death of <unk> martin and the more recent deaths of michael brown and eric garner after encounters with police officers
it's helped lead the online discussion of race relations in america
<unk> performed <unk> during the usa belgium world cup match and his <unk> skills inspired <unk> <unk> other things he could save
the u.s. team may not have won the world cup but <unk> definitely won the internet
months before the now famous sony hack celebrities such as actress jennifer <unk> and model kate <unk> had to deal with their <unk> accounts being <unk> and personal photos <unk>
the fbi quickly got on the case but not before the world had seen way more of some stars than they ever <unk>
many of the <unk> aren't <unk> for work but they are out there for you to <unk> after you clock out
after a <unk> space traveler called the <unk> probe landed on a <unk> in november the internet started <unk> about other things that are surely easier to <unk> than a <unk> landing but aren't happening
the jokes were endless but seriously why can't you order breakfast at <unk> after ten thirty a.m.
so many of the suggestions made total sense and we co signed many of them except <unk> <unk> the internet
because <unk> the internet was made for cat <unk>

rwanda was the best <unk> gaining five ranking places to end up as the eighth most prosperous country in africa

and it seems to be paying <unk> says the report
these findings <unk> trends across the continent where forty one percents of women are out of work as opposed to twenty three percents of men
we can not talk about the prosperity of women in africa if we don't change the inappropriate policies that <unk> their progress argues <unk> <unk> a davos young global leader and ceo of <unk> global solutions
we can not sugar <unk> the issues of funding <unk> gender equality recognition and representation and expect women to come winners within the current framework and plans we have in africa
other notable <unk> since two thousand and twelve included countries from east africa while neither kenya nor mozambique featured in the top ten most prosperous countries in africa they both rose by four places in the rankings since two thousand and twelve

in case you haven't noticed president obama has been <unk> his executive <unk> <unk>
on paper it's a head <unk>
after all he lost control of the senate in the last election
his popularity is <unk> near an all time low
and of course he's a lame duck
only no one seems to have told him
it's as if he has shed his <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> for the more <unk> cape
he's no <unk> to be sure but he's spending an awful lot of time <unk> trying to get off the ground
so after suffering a political <unk> he's showing he still has some muscle using executive authority everywhere he believes he can
president bill clinton famously declared his <unk> months after losing control of the house in one thousand nine hundred and ninety four
obama on the other hand is literally <unk> into <unk> action
on immigration
on climate change
on <unk> the internet
on cuba
i'm <unk> said a <unk> president in his year end press conference friday
i'm excited about the prospects for the next couple of years
and i'm certainly not going to be stopping for a minute
translation
this is the new all drama obama
and all of that <unk> up energy ambition and action barely two months after losing control of the senate
anyone would become <unk> and frustrated if you were accused of being a <unk> says a senior democratic policy adviser
and it's always better to be on offense than defense
it wasn't exactly a state secret that obama had a lot on his to do list after the election
the thinking according to a <unk> source
he felt <unk> and frustrated by his tactical responsibilities to democrats in trouble
don't rock the boat
don't make democrats take hard votes
don't even campaign in red states
so he didn't
and as it turns out the restraint helped not one <unk>
so now with the clock <unk> he's moved from party <unk> to the head of the executive branch
it's <unk> bar the door with or without the congress
at the press conference today the president strongly <unk> at a <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> take that republicans and red state democrats
and he wants tax reform too
t is the season for a presidential list and he's checking it twice as his legacy <unk>
everything he is doing <unk> the very notion of a lame duck
but here's what this <unk> of activity also <unk>
the two thousand and sixteen presidential race
in forcing the cuba issue front and center for instance republican presidential <unk> have to respond
so too on obama's moves on immigration
all sorts of new tests of conservative <unk> are being created by these moves
and some candidates could find themselves pushed in a direction they might not otherwise go
for instance <unk> the differences between republican pre presidential candidates <unk> rubio <unk> bush and <unk> paul on obama's cuba deal
rubio called the president the single worst negotiator we have had in the white house in my lifetime
bush did not like the deal but stopped short of name calling
i don't think we should be negotiating with a <unk> regime bush said a long way from <unk> <unk> that the president was <unk> ignorant and <unk>
and <unk> paul went even further in obama's direction saying opening up cuba is probably a good idea
in appealing to the younger cuban american <unk> obama is making the republicans choose sides
and he's gambling that the numbers are with him
eventually democrats will have to do the same
if obama's <unk> turns out to be <unk> hillary clinton will have to explain and likely defend it
if he's not pro active enough the elizabeth warren wing of the party will react
it's a <unk> that presidential campaigns are generally defined by the president who served before
barack obama is actively making sure that's the case
but there's one <unk> in this new <unk> pro active obama world
it just might lead to higher expectations
which is exactly where obama began and then <unk>
editor's note
<unk> <unk> is ceo of <unk> which makes a popular brand of greek style <unk>
the views expressed are his own
like many entrepreneurs i am often asked about the secrets to building a successful career
the advice i give is that whether you're in <unk> valley creating apps or in <unk> valley in <unk> new york making <unk> there are many common <unk> for success
but everything starts with opportunity whether it be the opportunity to study to work to build something or the opportunities <unk> by a safe home a stable society and a secure environment
these were all opportunities that i enjoyed as a young boy in a kurdish community in eastern turkey and as a young man who came to america inspired by the american dream
sadly far too many in the region where i grew up will never receive the opportunities that i had
in the decade since i began the <unk> business dramatic changes have occurred in the middle east
conflict has <unk> iraq and syria forcing millions of people to flee from their homes and seek refuge in neighboring countries
when i watch the reports from towns like kobani i see a <unk> despair in the eyes of refugees
their faces look familiar they are just like my <unk> <unk> and childhood friends
and yet the fear in their eyes seems very different
the truth is that although i grew up in their part of the world i can't imagine what it must be like to be forced to flee your home with your family not knowing if your grandmother will survive the journey or your daughter will ever see home again
in the past the world has risen to the moment and responded to similar crises
refugees from <unk> europe were taken in by dozens of countries across the world in the one thousand nine hundred and forty s and one thousand nine hundred and fifty s. similarly victims of conflict in vietnam cambodia and east africa in the one thousand nine hundred and seventy s and those from the <unk> in the one thousand nine hundred and ninety s found welcoming new homes in <unk> countries
with all that in mind i can not understand why the welcoming arms of the international community have become so <unk> and <unk> in the face of the latest crisis
last week at a pledging conference in geneva switzerland other countries could only muster a commitment to take in thirty eight thousand more refugees from syria in two thousand and fifteen despite the fact that we are currently facing the largest refugee crisis since world war ii
more than fifty million people around the world are now refugees or displaced people <unk> of <unk> opportunities by war persecution and natural disasters
so where is the big <unk> response of previous generations
have our hearts turned to stone
turkey alone took in more people in three days than the international community has offered to welcome in an entire year
lebanon and jordan have likewise <unk> enormous numbers
these countries and agencies like the united nations high commissioner for refugees and the international rescue committee which do extraordinary work desperately need financial support to be able to provide the basic <unk> for those who have fled across borders in search of safety
how can it be that such suffering exists just a few hours plane ride from some of the world's richest <unk>
and how can so many enjoy a life of <unk> and yet despite our more <unk> world appear so <unk> to quite how bad things have gotten
generosity starts with us as individuals
but the needs in this desperate situation are far too <unk> for private donors to ever meet on their own
governments across the globe must therefore answer the call to action just as they've done in the past
it is with this pressing need for action in mind that i have been a strong supporter of the <unk> immediate efforts to get winter supplies to refugee camps
i am also supporting new campaign initiatives to help advance long term solutions to the crisis
such efforts it is hoped will help decision makers around the world hear the voices of those that need help the most
this week i am writing to the foreign ministers of ten key countries calling on them to show leadership and deliver on their past commitments
it is a campaign i will continue with for as long as this crisis <unk>
and i would urge entrepreneurs from across the globe men and women who have already demonstrated their ability to shake things up to join in and press for change to address this injustice
so as many of us prepare to spend the holiday season with families and in conditions that millions of refugees could only dream of it is time to raise our voices as we seek to <unk> our leaders into action
this is what it means to have a human heart
not to <unk> our <unk> from others suffering but to step forward
to open our arms
to lift our voices and call for our leaders to wake up
and to do our duty to these sons and daughters brothers and sisters who are all part of the one human family
as those <unk> with opportunity in our own lives we must restore opportunity and hope to theirs

if golf has a reputation for being a bit <unk> then the <unk> brothers and their trick shots are a much needed blast of fresh air
<unk> from south carolina george and younger brother <unk> have been attracting a growing band of followers with a colorful array of videos
from <unk> shooting <unk> with a <unk> to <unk> shots from mid air in the dark the siblings are hoping to show off golf in a new light and attract a younger generation of players back to the sport
we love golf but most people think it's kind of <unk> george <unk> told cnn
we're providing something that's a little different
we're bringing a kind of <unk> fun way to view golf and hope that it brings in a younger <unk>
we want them to say
that's fun i <unk> <unk> go try the game the twenty six year old added
both brothers are <unk> professionals and started filming trick shots as a <unk> earlier this year but it has quickly grown into a mini industry after <unk> up tens of thousands of <unk> on their website and youtube
most of the <unk> are done on the fly explains twenty four year old <unk> who <unk> the <unk> set up by george
a lot of them work on the first or second try
if the ball comes into my hit zone then it normally goes pretty quick a lot <unk> than what people say on the comments board he added
the pair started out <unk> at <unk> and <unk> their local club in state capital <unk> but have since <unk> their content
in the summer a football themed world cup edition celebrated this year's tournament in brazil and <unk> with basketball trick shot specialists the legendary shots and pro <unk> and model <unk> <unk> have <unk> their appeal
the brothers are not the only trick shot artists to showcase their skills online
french golf professional <unk> <unk> incredible ball <unk> skills has received over half a million views on youtube and british trick shot specialist david <unk> has performed his routine at dozens of pro events including the open <unk> and the <unk> cup
when the <unk> brothers are not <unk> up new <unk> they compete on the national golf association pro golf tour and the web dot com tour a <unk> tour for the main <unk> tour which is where the pair hope to end up playing one day
the goal is really to use this to help our pro golf careers out but at the same time we view this as a <unk> we both enjoy it george says
and when we do have an off week it's good to get out minds off tournament golf and there's no better outlet to be creative than trying some trick shots out and seeing how far we can take it
it was the computer classroom where i <unk>
i'd managed to remain <unk> until then
i wanted to tell the story
look but don't <unk> was the <unk> i was <unk> inside my head
tell the facts explain what you are seeing and what happened
i focused
i don't think i've been somewhere with so much blood on the floor
over the years covering wars i've seen more than my share
<unk> the war in <unk> as yugoslavia <unk> itself apart was an <unk> against my <unk> fear of the red stuff
in that conflict <unk> ripped through crowds of civilians
i soon learned how head wounds <unk>
it's different
you don't forget
here it was again in the auditorium
dark and heavy
don't think focus and do your job i was <unk> myself
but after a while i couldn't
these were children <unk>
parents not far from here are suffering a <unk> pain none of us can imagine
parents whose job in the army is to protect their country not able to save their own children
the army officer showed us the doors where the children had tried to break out of the auditorium to run away from the taliban gunmen
the carpet is <unk> and red
the floor <unk> a mess of the worst of <unk>
the taliban could not have been more <unk> and <unk>
where the children were most <unk> they turned their automatic weapons on them at point blank range
cold <unk> murder
the officer tells me close to one hundred children were gunned down right here
again i'm telling myself to focus
explain this brutal <unk> act
leaving the dark sad auditorium for the light of day i feel i can <unk> better
i look up at the sky
it's the color of hope clear blue and not a cloud to be seen
i shouldn't have looked down again
i'm walking over to the classrooms at army public school and degree college
drops <unk> pools of blood are everywhere
i'm becoming <unk> that i'm trying not to step on them
it seems <unk> somehow
how i am thinking could the taliban be looking for even more <unk> when they have already killed so many
but they are
that's when i get to the computer classroom maybe thirty feet long by fifteen feet across
computers on rough benches down each side of the room
space for maybe a dozen or so children to <unk> their computer skills
you didn't have to be rich to send your child to this school and in pakistan in peshawar in particular on a global scale that <unk> your means might be quite humble indeed
quite possibly some of these kids wouldn't have a computer at home
in our ever <unk> world lessons in this room could have been some of the most valuable to their <unk>
and that's it
i'm standing there <unk> they have no <unk> now
the base horror that took place here is <unk> and immediately evident
chairs still at computers thick blood <unk> underneath on the <unk> floor
the gunmen came in and before the children could escape opened fire
as i try to explain all this on camera i can feel my voice cracking
it's not a <unk> thing its what the brain does a self defense maybe
such a horrible waste of so many bright <unk> so many parents in pain
it <unk> and there is no getting away from it

two official of hong kong were found guilty of conspiracy to commit misconduct in the city's biggest corruption trial
the <unk> thomas kwok along with his younger brother raymond kwok were accused of <unk> <unk> hui the government official in offenses spanning nearly a decade
the kwok brothers who rank eighty six th on the two thousand and fourteen forbes list of the world's richest people are co chairs of the <unk> giant sun hung kai which is responsible for many of hong kong's most iconic <unk>
the main question during their trial was whether the brothers had bought the allegiance of hui hong kong's former chief secretary
after five days of <unk> a hong kong high court jury found the older kwok guilty of <unk> hui between two thousand and five and two thousand and seven
immediately after the verdict thomas kwok resigned from his position at sun hung kai and his son adam kwok was named the company's next executive director
meanwhile his younger brother raymond kwok was cleared of all charges
hui is the highest ranking former official to face trial in hong kong
the court looked into whether hui received monetary and housing benefits worth at least four point three million dollar from the <unk> in return for government decisions favorable to the company
the charges related to accepting rent free <unk> <unk> loans and a <unk> agreement with the property company
the jury found him guilty on three counts of misconduct in a public office conspiracy to commit misconduct in public office and conspiracy to offer an advantage to a public <unk>
the jury also found thomas chan who was responsible for land <unk> at the company and francis <unk> a former hong kong stock exchange official guilty for making a series of payments to hui
the sentencing hearing for the four who were convicted will be held monday
raymond kwok was released from custody after his arrest in two thousand and twelve
as he left the court kwok said he had mixed feelings that he was free but his brother had been found guilty
the case caused a media <unk> in the city where real estate is a local <unk>

north korea with its previous <unk> <unk> image may have just shocked the world with some alleged hacking savvy but when isis comes to mind so does the terrorists digital <unk>
the islamist militants renowned for their <unk> beheading videos and slick social media propaganda may have extended their skills into low level hacking a cyber security human rights group believes
the citizen lab obtained new malware that has targeted the isis opposition group raqqa is being slaughtered <unk> or <unk> and released an analysis of it thursday
the researchers from the university of toronto can't confirm that the cyberattack is coming from the islamic state in iraq and syria especially since the syrian regime led by bashar al assad has also used <unk> horse software to fight activists since two thousand and eleven
but the <unk> of the malware its intended target and what it <unk> for the attacker lead the citizen lab to suspect isis the most
isis is particularly motivated to strike <unk>
the islamist extremist militants like to depict their stronghold city of raqqa to the world as a caliphate paradise where life under <unk> sharia is practically heaven on earth
but <unk> activists in the city reveal on social media <unk> bleeding <unk> the <unk> of residents
warnings of graphic content <unk> its twitter feed where photos of public beheadings and <unk> of residents in syrian cities are posted in <unk> detail
<unk> also reports coalition airstrike hits against isis and warns raqqa residents about new strict sharia rules the militants impose on them
but activists participating in <unk> activities have another enemy
before isis took over their town they were taking the same actions against the syrian regime
the raqqa target who passed along the malware to the citizen lab did not fall for its <unk> and the group was not successfully hacked as far as the citizen lab researcher john <unk> <unk> knows
but he fears others who may have received the target email may not have been so savvy or lucky
the malware used in the attack is simple and <unk> and whoever wrote it did some things wrong or felt it wasn't necessary to do them right
the citizen lab found the malware to be effective and very dangerous even without proper <unk> <unk> and <unk> because its targeting of victims is <unk> savvy
this is how it works
the victim receives an <unk> email <unk> to his anti isis interests from people claiming to be <unk> syrian activists living in canada
they ask for the local <unk> help in working with mainstream media
we are preparing a lengthy news report on the <unk> of life in <unk> the email reads
we are sharing some information with you with the hope that you will correct it in case it contains <unk>
images are attached showing <unk> photos with spots marked on them <unk> alleged isis strongholds and u.s. airstrike targets
and the email includes a link to a file sharing site where the victim is encouraged to <unk> files which contain a <unk> of more such images
but in the <unk> is also a <unk> file and while the victim views more photos it <unk> a set of small malware files onto the <unk> computer
once there these bad files don't do much the citizen lab said
just enough
the <unk> malware
<unk> home with the <unk> address of the victim's computer and details about his or her system each time the computer <unk> it said in its study
that's enough for militants who know the area to determine the <unk> physical location
the files don't include a key <unk> although many forms of the software that monitors what infected users are writing are <unk> available on the internet
such <unk> are typical of the syrian regime whose hackers seems more interested in <unk> opposition activist content the researchers <unk> <unk> and seth <unk> said
a <unk> would have provided much greater access alongside <unk> information they said
it makes the researchers think that whoever is using the <unk> malware may be interested only in identifying and <unk> a target
find his internet caf or apartment
<unk> him in
punish him or <unk> him
that's probably the idea the citizen lab said
american journalist james foley who isis later beheaded was captured coming out of an internet caf in syria in two thousand and twelve before isis officially <unk>
this attempted hack doesn't bear the signature of typical syrian regime attackers the citizen lab said
they usually <unk> <unk> to <unk> data sent back by their <unk> but this malware doesn't need one
it sends an <unk> with the <unk> information it <unk> to an email account
this <unk> would be especially useful to an <unk> <unk> of whether it can maintain <unk> internet <unk> the researchers said
whether <unk> or <unk>
that email is <unk> <unk> leaving the <unk> <unk> <unk> open to <unk>
one of the <unk> <unk> is also visible in its code
there are other apparent <unk> and software itself is <unk> <unk>
it <unk> on a half dozen separate <unk> files each with a single task the researchers said
but keeping it bare bones has an advantage the researchers said
the program looks less like malware and may attract less attention from <unk> protection tools and <unk>
<unk> were low when the file was first submitted to <unk> for example
it registered only six fifty five <unk> by anti virus <unk> or a ten percents detection rate
this malware flies under the radar
there's little question that edm is the fastest growing musical genre out there

the numbers don't lie
so far forbes top ten edm artists have <unk> up a combined two hundred and sixty eight million dollar this year an eleven percents increase from two thousand and thirteen with top <unk> harris bringing in sixty six million dollar
how did this musical genre grow from a small <unk> following into this global phenomenon we feel today
how have those who've stuck with it from the beginning grown with it
and where is it going next
to obtain these answers we headed to one of the biggest festivals in the world <unk> to meet up with some of the <unk> key players

electronic dance music is not a new genre
in fact it's been around for more than three decades
david guetta whose dj days began in paris in the late <unk> recalls how the house electronic music movement began when the disco era was ending
there was a movement called disco <unk> he says
it was a shame to like disco but then there was no music to dance to so some djs started to use old disco records but the b sides and the <unk> and we began producing <unk> with <unk> machines
i remember buying those records and the label says guetta
would use old records and print on top of it melt it and print on the <unk> low quality this was super super underground
in other words disco music is <unk> <unk>
i started in eighty eight to play house music it was a huge revolution for me
i went to london and i saw a dj on stage and that was crazy at the time
i was one of the really respected and famous djs in paris but they would never show me
i was hidden
a dj on stage and people dancing and facing the dj looking at him
i was like <unk>
says guetta as if still surprised to this day
a few years later in the early <unk> in the netherlands <unk> <unk> <unk> began his journey to becoming <unk>
he also started when the genre was completely underground
a trip to spain some parties and general love for music got him interested in becoming a dj
back then first of all we all played <unk> records so even when you knew the track you could not get it
everything was very exclusive says <unk> in his dressing room three hundred meters away from the main stage of <unk>
that's the big difference with nowadays because when you <unk> to a track you already know what it is and then right away you have the song in your phone or your <unk> was a very magical period because you played a track and people said i know this track but they still couldn't find it
that was very special says <unk> as his staff calls him
it's hard to <unk> a date and location to the <unk> of edm
some say it began in germany and london others make a case that it started in detroit in the u.s. for guetta both <unk> played a role this is what <unk> was born in the u.s. but the <unk> made it <unk>
and it became a massive movement in europe but never in the u.s. which is crazy
he later adds i think america is always creating the new movement and then the <unk> has this genius of taking this concept and making it accessible to the masses
from underground to the masses
recently guetta has had mainstream success by <unk> with pop stars like kelly <unk> and the black eyed <unk> for whom he produced the best selling single i got <unk> feeling in two thousand and nine
other successful djs including likes of <unk> harris and <unk> have also found success this way
i love <unk> outside of my space says steve <unk> who has worked with artists like <unk> and luke <unk>
when i got into the dance culture and started producing the music i kept on thinking how to do something unique or different than what the status quo does
for edm <unk> may have attracted <unk> but the internet and its subsequent components <unk>
social media apps and music sharing programs have played essential roles in getting more
nowadays in the digital era success is <unk> in followers video hits <unk> <unk> tweets <unk> and likes

for us it has played a very big role says michael <unk> of the <unk> <unk> vegas and like mike

social media has been the biggest factor in our career
in europe and the americas mainly there are an increasing number of electronic music festivals
events that gather people from all over the world and celebrate in <unk>
the <unk> festival celebrated outside of atlanta <unk> gathered one hundred and sixty thousand people from seventy five countries this year according to the organizers
it's like a theme park for adults says <unk>
not all <unk> can <unk> about selling out festivals with over one hundred and fifty thousand <unk> and do it in a matter of minutes
sure some could mention the <unk> and the <unk> of the world but they offer musical variety
from pop to rock <unk> to <unk> and even country
edm festivals offer only edm
when i'm on stage i'm looking out and seeing everyone putting up their flags from hundreds of different countries representing hundreds of different cultural <unk>
they're all jumping in <unk> forming almost like one <unk> one spiritual being adds <unk> who besides his music is known for his <unk> with the crowds riding <unk> <unk> and <unk> one lucky fan per show
if you're <unk> about the latter it's a steve <unk> <unk> where he <unk> a whole cake to someone in the audience
based on reactions seen from the fans they love it
when they get <unk> in the face the first thing they do is immediately turn around to make sure that everyone else saw that they got <unk> it's a very bizarre thing
people don't get it says <unk> full of enthusiasm
naturally edm was unlikely to become this popular without <unk> incredible amounts of money
a recent report stated that edm is a six point two billion dollar global industry
most of the money comes from festivals las vegas club dates and other global club <unk>
all this <unk> the interest of ad men and the big brands they represent
in fact some have already made moves and are <unk> festivals events and others have djs featured in <unk>
business is good but is the music getting better
edm has been highly criticized
many see edm as an art that lost its <unk>
it's an evolution
the thing is that every musical genre starts from the underground gets <unk> then it becomes popular and then it <unk> or it is <unk> in a different way says guetta
many wonder if edm is at his highest point
is this its <unk>
or will it end soon just like disco did
they've been asking me that since one thousand nine hundred and ninety four is it going to end
i always say i don't know
it keeps <unk> every year something new comes up and now it's at the highest it ever has been so now i don't know how much higher and how much better it'll get says <unk>
it has been more than twenty twenty five years that this music is existing so it's already amazing

it's a long road to recovery for spanish <unk> assistant <unk> romero <unk>
<unk> from hospital six weeks ago after beating ebola she faces life without her beloved dog <unk> put down by spanish authorities for fear he might <unk> the deadly virus
and questions remain about how she contracted the virus while helping to care for spanish <unk> brought back from west africa with ebola and the way her own case was handled
romero was in court thursday to seek one hundred and fifty thousand euros in <unk> from the then madrid health minister she <unk> of blaming her for catching the disease
he publicly apologized for the comments and later resigned
she is also taking legal action against regional health authorities over the death of <unk>
speaking to cnn from madrid in her only global tv interview since leaving hospital romero became <unk> as she recounted how she learned her <unk> dog had been put down
due to my serious illness no one was telling me what was happening in the outside world she said
<unk> to her locked away in a hospital isolation room animal rights activists had <unk> to prevent the dog's <unk> with an online petition gathering more than four hundred thousand <unk>
but their efforts failed
can <unk> get or spread ebola
finally on the day romero received a negative blood test for ebola her husband <unk> <unk> broke the news in a phone call to her room
my husband decided to wait in order to tell me about it and to me it was a very sad piece of news totally unexpected
i haven't got words to talk about it she said her <unk> obvious
it was probably better not to tell her while she was ill she said but the loss still affects her today
i've forgotten about everything except the death of <unk> not the death itself but the way in which this was done without finding out first whether the dog was infected she said
i think it <unk> been much <unk> to put the dog in <unk> and keep an eye on it rather than to sacrifice the dog like that
this was what happened in the case of texas nurse <unk> <unk> whose dog <unk> was <unk> while she was treated for ebola
after testing negative for the virus the pet was eventually returned tail <unk> to its grateful owner
it was easier for the madrid authorities to have her dog put down romero said but it made what was already a traumatic situation for her far harder
and she still asks herself why it had to be that way
it's a lack of <unk> a lack of human feelings it's really <unk> <unk>
everything has been this way but we forget about everything except the death of my dog
the everything romero refers to <unk> to the way her infection with ebola was first diagnosed and then handled
after she was taken to the <unk> hospital in madrid by ambulance suffering symptoms including <unk> and a <unk> she <unk> a battery tests
but such was the apparent state of confusion she said that she found out she'd been confirmed as having ebola not from medical staff but by seeing the news story on her cell phone
it is surreal nobody tells you anything and they come and put you inside a <unk> and they take you away
and they didn't tell you anything
it is really odd
she said she later found out that the emergency room doctor who first treated her was not informed about her two positive blood tests either
surprising as it is this is how it happened she said
no doctor told me about it nobody told me anything about it nothing
i think that they were going crazy
this took us all <unk>
cnn is seeking comment from the spanish health ministry over <unk> allegation that news that she had tested positive for ebola was given to the press before she found out
it's still not clear how this leak <unk>
you think about it
meanwhile <unk> superior court has already ruled once on the case of <unk> saying that regional health officials did not act <unk> in putting him down
but <unk> legal team is planning to take them to court again seeking one hundred and fifty thousand euros <unk> for his death
she also wants to see a change in the official <unk> for caring for suspected ebola cases so others don't undergo the same ordeal
this could include recording the medical staff as they work so any <unk> in taking off the protective gear could be spotted and lessons learned according to romero
she says she still does not know how she herself contracted the virus and likely never will
i followed the <unk>
i followed the guidelines
i did everything that needs to be done she said
what you are doing is something so serious you are risking your life every time you walk into a room so you think about it
last month the <unk> director general dr. <unk> perez <unk> said that through <unk> case the hospital had learned many lessons about the treatment of ebola patients and how to protect staff caring for them
romero said she was not yet completely physically recovered from the virus which has killed more than six thousand people in west africa but was slowly getting better

violence <unk> yemen yet again thursday this time in the form of <unk> car bomb attacks purportedly carried out by al qaeda militants targeting fighters from the minority <unk> powerful houthi group
at least nine houthi fighters died in the attacks on a strategic houthi camp at the airport of western yemen's port city of <unk> a local interior ministry official and <unk> told cnn
<unk> expected the death toll to rise as some of about a dozen people injured in the attacks are in critical condition
the bloodshed speaks to the dangers and instability in the arab nation though this time not involving anyone with the yemeni government
instead it is houthis followers of a <unk> of shia islam in a country where sunni muslims are the majority who find themselves in the fight
based largely in northern yemen members of the group also known as <unk> have been increasingly <unk> themselves in the country
this included weeks of large anti government protest in the capital sanaa during which houthi fighters attacked state tv headquarters and seized strategic military positions
yemen in midst of an <unk>
scores died in resulting violence and two yemeni prime ministers resigned in two weeks before the powerful rebel group and representatives of major political parties signed a ceasefire in september
but even with that resolved a houthi <unk> al qaeda in the arabian peninsula a terror group whose members are sunni muslims remains
that group also known as aqap claimed responsibility for thursday's attack on its twitter account
thursday's violence marked the latest of scores of clashes between houthi and al qaeda fighters
the houthis have managed to defeat al qaeda on numerous fronts including taking the terror group's stronghold of <unk> in october
al qaeda has stepped up its attacks on houthi targets since then killing hundreds of houthis and innocent civilians in <unk> attacks
u.s. airstrikes have killed two top level and one mid level isis leader a senior u.s. military official tells cnn
<unk> <unk> was abu bakr al baghdadi's deputy in iraq
abd al <unk> was his military emir in iraq
and <unk> <unk> was his mosul emir
their deaths resulted from multiple strikes going back to mid november it has taken until now to determine <unk> they were killed
i can confirm that since mid november targeted coalition airstrikes successfully killed multiple senior and mid level leaders within the islamic state of iraq and the <unk> said pentagon press secretary rear <unk> john kirby in a statement on thursday
we believe that the loss of these key leaders <unk> <unk> ability to command and control current operations against iraqi security forces including kurdish and other local forces in iraq he said
news of the killings was first disclosed by joint <unk> chairman martin <unk> in an interview with the wall street journal
in addition president barack obama signed <unk> orders yesterday for one thousand three hundred troops to iraq
this is the <unk> share of the one thousand five hundred additional troops he authorized last month
by february the u.s. will have roughly three thousand u.s. troops on the ground
the u.s. troops are also going further <unk> than they previously were
there are now nearly three hundred u.s. forces at al <unk> base in <unk> province up from just fifty earlier this month
the u.s. military is following through on announced plans to <unk> these military <unk> and <unk> outside of baghdad and <unk>
north korea is one of the world's poorest countries seen as well behind most everyone when it comes to most technologies and much more
hacking may not be one of them
<unk> resources or not a <unk> who once worked as a computer expert for the north korean government says that it has a vast network of hackers devoted to <unk> against perceived enemies of the <unk> state
jang <unk> <unk> who <unk> from north korea seven years ago told cnn that he thinks there are one thousand eight hundred <unk> in the agency stationed around the world
but he says even the agents themselves don't know how many others work for the secretive group called bureau one hundred and twenty one whose mission is to conduct cyberattacks against overseas and enemy states
the south korean government thinks bureau one hundred and twenty one is the agency at the heart of numerous cyberattacks from north korea against elements in foreign countries a government official who requested to be anonymous told cnn on thursday
north korea's hacking capabilities have become a global talking point recently after a massive hack of sony pictures the studio behind the interview a comedy depicting the assassination of <unk> leader kim jong un
that was followed by warnings that the movie not be shown in theaters something that's a <unk> for now after sony called off its planned release wednesday
u.s. investigators say an announcement blaming pyongyang for this could come as soon as thursday
north korea's government has denied responsibility for the <unk> hack even as its state news agency applauded it
the hacking into the sony pictures might be a <unk> <unk> of the supporters and <unk> with the dprk <unk> reported
<unk> generally on the north korean government's hacking <unk> jang said he thinks the <unk> east asian nation's <unk> is more real and more dangerous than the <unk> ability to launch a nuclear offensive even if it is the latter that has contributed to <unk> sanctions other <unk> and the country's isolation on the world stage
said jang this silent war the <unk> has already begun without a single bullet fired
whether or not it's behind the sony hack south korean intelligence thinks bureau one hundred and twenty one has struck before according to the government official
south korea has repeatedly accused the north of hacking attacks including incidents in two thousand and ten and two thousand and twelve that targeted banks and media organizations
pyongyang has rejected the allegations
the biggest case became known as dark seoul a series of <unk> between march and june two thousand and thirteen that targeted south korean banks and media companies
more than forty eight thousand computers were hit <unk> the companies computer networks with a <unk> program or malware that <unk> or shut down systems
<unk> military <unk> up its cyber alert level in response and an official south korean investigation later <unk> the blame for this attack on its northern neighbor finding that many of the <unk> <unk> employed in the attacks were similar to ones used by pyongyang previously said lee <unk> won an official at the south korean science ministry
a spokesman for the general staff of north korea's military called these allegations which came at a time of heightened tensions between the two longtime rivals <unk> and a deliberate provocation to push the situation on the korean peninsula to an extreme phase according to <unk>
assuming some of the allegations are well founded some might question how or why a country that's so poor with so few resources would <unk> so much to <unk>
jang who says he is still in contact with at least one of bureau one hundred and twenty one's members says the answer is simple
raising <unk> is <unk> cheap
the world has the wrong view of the north korean state he adds
with that <unk> world view north korea was able to increase its ability to launch cyberattacks
jang attended north korea's military college for computer science the university of <unk> and worked in information services for the government before <unk>
he showed cnn <unk> of information he says was stolen by north korean operatives from bureau one hundred and twenty one
the information taken from south korean financial institutions which jang says he got from a bureau one hundred and twenty one operation appeared to list bank accounts names and financial data
the dark seoul <unk> were harmful but one analyst thinks that the sony attack if it's indeed linked to north korea represents an escalation of tactics
i think we <unk> north korea's <unk> said <unk> <unk> director of asian studies at <unk> university
they certainly didn't evidence this sort of capability in the previous attacks
he called the sony hack and the <unk> decision to pull the interview a big win for pyongyang
they got the u.s. government to admit that north korea was the source of this and there's no action plan
in response to it <unk> said
i think from their perspective in pyongyang they're probably popping the <unk> <unk>
at the end of that summer my grandfather told his son that he would not be coming home
that he should stay in spain and wait for the rest of the family to join him
it was a long wait
it would take my grandfather more than ten years to get out of cuba
i've always wondered if that summer vacation was part of my <unk> plan to make sure that my father would not be trapped in <unk> cuba
maybe if my father had known he wasn't coming back home he would have put up a fight to stay in havana
my mother recently found that <unk> airline ticket sitting in a box of my father's things
the ticket to a flight that never happened is a heartbreaking <unk> of family history still frozen in time
for many americans the reaction to the news that the united states and cuba have announced plans to <unk> relations was it's about time
for many americans cuba is nothing more than a forbidden playground with <unk> rum beautiful beaches and <unk> players
they want to experience a taste of this island trapped in time
they want to see the classic american cars rolling through the streets of old havana
to the families of cuban exiles the island is much more
it's a complex and sad reality
cuba is not a <unk> or an <unk> box on a <unk> list
cuba is the <unk> <unk> of a life lost long ago but still beating in our souls
<unk> revolution split my family apart like so many others
i still have extended family in cuba
i've had only a few chances to spend time with them
i'm the only person in my family who has traveled to cuba since most of my family left
all my life i've wondered if this historic moment would ever come in my lifetime
in my mind it was supposed to be a moment like the berlin wall coming down
a highly <unk> event the world would watch together
but instead the news seemed to come out of thin air on the week before christmas
unexpected and unpredictable that's the way it always seems to be with cuba
with <unk> relations many people want to see a <unk> of foreign investment led by americans <unk> to a place that's been locked behind the gates of the cold war for more than fifty years
but i ask you to understand as best as i can explain the fear and <unk> this news means to many cuban exiles
people often tell me that they'd love to travel to cuba because it seems like such a fun place
i tell them of my uncle who well into his old age would wake up at four in the morning to get in line for a <unk> of bread
i remember the first time i visited cuba i watched my uncle come home with a piece of bread that had more in common with a <unk> <unk>
i couldn't believe that my elderly uncle would wake up every morning to stand in line for that
people often tell me they want to walk the streets of old havana and see the <unk> buildings
i tell them of the countless young girls who work as <unk> <unk> for cuban <unk> to help earn money for their families who live <unk> inside those walls
it's <unk> to think that so many men from around the world come to cuba for just this reason
these are the kinds of things cuban exile families think about when they think of cuba
it's overwhelming sadness
there's a very <unk> class in cuba
the families of those in power live a life that rivals that of the most comfortable americans
so when cuban exiles hear of <unk> relations they worry that it's cuba's <unk> class that will benefit the most at the expense of ordinary cubans
fear that the status quo will <unk>
many cuban exiles feel that the castro regime has won the war for more than fifty years and that <unk> relations is another victory for a corrupt and evil dictatorship
they always win is a common sentiment among cuban exiles who have such a <unk> of the castro regime
many exiles fear a wrong move will provide another victory for a dictatorship that took so much from them
for more than fifty years cuba's story has surprised and <unk> many exiles and their families and we can't help but fear history will repeat itself
we see family and friends left behind on the island who've spent decades fighting and <unk> for the most <unk> of lives
no <unk> <unk> said president obama the spanish phrase often used to describe life in cuba
it translates to life is not easy
and that's putting it <unk>
perhaps it's inevitable that u.s. and other foreign investment will <unk> into cuba one day
maybe it's just a matter of time before a <unk> restaurant sits on the <unk> havana's famous <unk> boulevard just ninety miles from south florida
or maybe americans will rush in to buy up <unk> property with amazing views on the most beautiful beaches of cuba
but i ask you this
what kind of view will ordinary cubans get
my father didn't live long enough to see this moment
my grandparents aren't here to see it either
and most in my family have mixed emotions about what this will really mean
this christmas we'll argue about it over black <unk> and rice and <unk> pork
the children of cuban exiles like me all dream of walking the streets of cuba with our parents and grandparents to finally feel that <unk> beat of our cuban soul that still sits in our hearts
london's metropolitan police have opened investigations into the deaths of three young boys a probe that is tied to allegations of serious and organized sexual abuse it announced thursday
in a statement <unk> involved in operation <unk> an investigation launched last month into sexual abuse dating back more than thirty years ago pleaded for the <unk> help in tracking down victims witnesses and assailants
today i want to appeal directly to those other young boys now men who were also subject to abuse at the hands of these men <unk> <unk> <unk> mcdonald said
i believe that there were other boys who were abused or who were present whilst the abuse took place
in addition to sex abuse mcdonald said that his team is also investigating the possible murder of three young boys
our work is ongoing and we are examining reports of missing people from that time he added
to date we have not recovered any bodies
the abuse is believed to have taken place over at least a decade at various locations across london and the <unk> surrounding the capital including military <unk> the police statement said
one site for the alleged abuse is the <unk> square estate an apartment complex in <unk> central london
one witness known as nick has spoken to us
he has said he was abused from the age of seven until he was sixteen from one thousand nine hundred and seventy five one thousand nine hundred and eighty four said mcdonald
some of the abuse took place at a flat on the <unk> square estate
however i can't rule out this was the only flat used
nick has told police how a car would be sent to collect him and drive him to the apartment in <unk> square mcdonald said
the abuse he has detailed that he was subjected to was carried out by a man on his own a group of men or during what have been described as parties the officer said
police want to speak to anyone who lived in the area from the early one thousand nine hundred and seventy s <unk> and may have seen something that they now realize could be significant to this investigation mcdonald said
<unk> are in touch with the families of two boys one who disappeared in one thousand nine hundred and seventy nine and another who <unk> and then was found murdered in one thousand nine hundred and eighty one but it is not yet possible to say if those two cases are linked to the current investigation he added

perhaps each <unk> grew when smaller pieces of <unk> <unk> struck the <unk> <unk> and then <unk> in place it wrote on its website
the raised <unk> are <unk> due to the <unk> but what about the inner lines
the air temperature was <unk> at night due to the clear sky conditions but warmer in the day meaning the <unk> may have grown at night then during the day when the <unk> <unk> in the sun further <unk> between the <unk> caused the <unk> to be pushed up
the next night further growth would have occurred followed by a new <unk> the next day
the trust said it's the first time the <unk> more <unk> found in the <unk> or the <unk> sea have been seen on the river <unk>

more <unk> of <unk> blood and abandoned shoes lie by one of two doors through which the army says the students sought to flee the auditorium
a hundred of them were gunned down as they tried to escape in an act of cold <unk> murder
it was the place where the greatest number of lives were lost
beyond the auditorium blood <unk> can still be seen on the ground in all <unk>
not <unk> with their slaughter in the auditorium the taliban attackers went upstairs to a computer lab
pools of blood on the floor show how their young victims many of them sons and daughters of army personnel from around peshawar were sprayed with bullets as they sat at each machine

the measures would be applied starting saturday the european union said
we will get through this period
in the final question of the more than three hour conference putin was asked whether he took personal responsibility for russia's economic issues and if he would stand in the two thousand and eighteen presidential elections
he replied that it was too early to make a decision on running and said the economic responsibility was nothing i can take on alone and i don't plan to
putin pointed to the responsibility of the central bank and different government bodies for the results of the work of each department for which they have responsibility
he ended the conference on a positive note

it's seen as an <unk> to crop out hands feet or head when taking photos of statues or pictures of government leaders or officials <unk> <unk> a documentary photographer wrote in an article for cnn
his comments were echoed by photojournalist <unk> <unk> who told <unk> about her experience
you have to bow
out of respect and if you take pictures you should take the entire statue she said
you can not take a portrait for example
because it's a lack of respect
and you can not take pictures from behind
<unk> also warned that you're not allowed to <unk> a newspaper with an image of the leader on it
ok so we're not talking about party balloons
the north korean regime regularly works itself into a <unk> of rage about balloons <unk> over the border by south korean activists
their anger is directed specifically at the cargo carried by the balloons
that can include items like dollar bills <unk> and tiny am <unk> <unk> that show the prosperity in south korea as well as documents criticizing the north korean regime

michel <unk> of course was not his real name
rather it was a cover used by brian stonehouse a british spy and <unk> artist who had <unk> into france the month before as part of the legendary special operations executive a <unk> espionage and <unk> unit
on landing in france his radio <unk> had become <unk> in a tree and his first few days had been <unk> trying to <unk> it without attracting attention
<unk> he had gone to ground for two weeks living on nothing but stolen <unk> a <unk> which had left him with <unk> <unk> before risking the train journey to <unk> to make contact with a spy network known as <unk>
stonehouse had been trained as a <unk> radio operator and given the <unk> <unk>
on the train that day he was carrying a <unk> that had been specially <unk> to contain a secret <unk> the one he had managed to rescue from the tree
at that time the life <unk> of an <unk> radio operator in occupied france was just six weeks
knowing that something as <unk> as a british <unk> on his <unk> could give the game away <unk> <unk> section had <unk> made <unk> clothes using french <unk> <unk> and techniques
but for some reason he was still wearing british made shoes
he told the story to his sister but she isn't sure how the mistake occurred says philip <unk> managing director of the <unk> and holder <unk> art <unk> in london who has collected <unk> work
maybe he was wearing french shoes to start with but they got <unk> so he changed them at a safe house
either way he was lucky to escape
that stonehouse was nearly given away by his clothing is <unk>
after the war he enjoyed a <unk> career as a fashion <unk> becoming one of the leading artists for <unk> and <unk> <unk>
he even painted a portrait of britain's queen mother which <unk> in the special forces club in london to this day
but this was not before he had spent almost three years in captivity
in october one thousand nine hundred and forty two the <unk> were able to <unk> his position during a secret transmission and stonehouse was arrested
he spent the rest of the war in various prisons and camps including in the <unk> <unk> concentration camp
he survived only because he was able to draw the guards wives and <unk> in exchange for extra food and shelter
immediately after the war stonehouse returned to <unk> to make <unk> of the <unk> in order to bear witness
he was also able to use his exceptional visual memory to serve his country one last time
officials from <unk> were trying to find out what had happened to four of their female officers
stonehouse was able to draw from memory four well dressed women that he had seen being taken to their deaths by the nazis the year before
his <unk> <unk> their photographs
as a result their files were closed and their families were informed of their deaths
it was while stonehouse was acting as a witness at the war crimes <unk> that he met the american <unk> harry <unk> then a major in the united states army
<unk> persuaded stonehouse to move to new york to join the large number of second world war <unk> <unk> who were <unk> america's fashion trends

six years ago members of his family discovered a box of his pictures and brought them to a british legion road show in bury st <unk> to be <unk>
eventually they were <unk> and i recognized their <unk> and <unk> them

the chinese government has pledged to protect an eight year old boy with hiv who was <unk> by his entire village in the southwestern province of sichuan state media reported
a photo from a people <unk> online report last week showed the boy called kunkun watching villagers unanimously vote for his removal in a meeting held in early december
even his own grandfather added his name to the petition signed by more than two hundred villagers
kunkun is diagnosed with aids causing great fear among the villagers and village children
in order to ensure the safety of villagers and children we demand that authorities <unk> kunkun for treatment the petition read
in response china's health authority promised to <unk> kunkun with the right to medical treatment education and a living <unk> reported china daily
everyday life with an infected person doesn't affect others health and the infected person's rights are protected by laws and regulations said <unk> <unk> director of the national center for aids <unk> control and prevention in a press release issued saturday
the united nations had also released a statement expressing concern over the reports on kunkun
kunkun a <unk> used to protect his identity was <unk> from school and <unk> by members of the community after he was diagnosed in two thousand and eleven said the people <unk> newspaper
he's a <unk> time bomb
my daughter is around his age and goes to a <unk> school now

that boy is too dangerous says he <unk> one of the villagers
the report said the boy contracted the disease from his mother before he was born
kunkun whose parents are migrant workers in <unk> lives with his sixty nine year old grandfather
with no school willing to take him in he is often found roaming the streets alone
no one wants to play with me the newspaper quoted kunkun as saying
his grandfather told local media the boy's parents have stopped sending money back home since he was diagnosed
in response to the petition local authorities have stressed that <unk> rights should be respected
they plan to launch an educational campaign hoping to reduce the stigma of people living with hiv aids
some seven hundred and eighty thousand people are living with hiv aids in china according to the latest count by the joint united nations program on hiv aids in two thousand and eleven
people living with hiv or aids in china face widespread discrimination and stigma especially in rural areas where there is a lack of education about the disease
china has sought to tackle the stigma by establishing laws and regulations <unk> discrimination against people with hiv
china's first lady <unk> <unk> who was appointed world health <unk> goodwill ambassador for aids in two thousand and eleven has appeared in public <unk> holding hands and playing with hiv positive children

the two thousand and four tsunami was one of the most devastating natural disasters in living memory and the <unk> response a huge outpouring of governmental and private support a <unk> <unk> to what was a hugely <unk> event
it has provided an ideal case study for disaster relief and an oxfam report published today <unk> the lessons that have been learned as well as areas that the humanitarian relief sector still needs to improve upon
the tsunami which hit communities as far <unk> as thailand indonesia somalia and <unk> was sparked by a massive nine point one magnitude <unk> which struck off the western coast of northern <unk> indonesia
the immediate impact was devastation
a staggering five million people needed humanitarian assistance in the first few days following the incident
the hardest hit countries indonesia sri lanka india and thailand were among the poorest and the disaster only <unk> the <unk> and <unk> issues those nations were already facing
oxfam says the response to the humanitarian catastrophe was the largest ever privately funded response with private donations making up forty percents of all money raised an impressive five point four billion dollar which came close to <unk> government donations of six point four billion dollar
a further two billion dollar of disaster relief funding came in the form of loans and <unk>
oxfam itself raised two hundred and ninety four dollar m for the tsunami relief effort with over ninety percents of its funds coming from private donors
jane <unk> <unk> humanitarian director told cnn it was largely the absolutely horrific scale of the tragedy that brought out <unk> generosity
people <unk> <unk> they came out of the blue and just wanted to help
all the things that come together to ensure that people do connect were all there it was a natural disaster it was enormous completely unexpected she said
oxfam sent aid to seven of the worst affected countries and continued to provide assistance well after the initial relief effort
the scale and <unk> of the relief operation meant many of the countries were able to return to some <unk> of <unk> a few short months after the disaster had such a widespread impact
in the wake of the disaster badly hit regions <unk> to build back better creating solid infrastructure better able to <unk> <unk> and <unk> and investing more in emergency education and evacuation procedures
but the speed and level of funding for the disaster was unprecedented and in itself almost overwhelming
like other <unk> organizations oxfam soon <unk> fundraising for the disaster urging the public to donate to other less well <unk> <unk> by mid january two thousand and five
the charity says that one of the key lessons learned from the tsunami and its aftermath is that humanitarian funding needs to become more <unk>
<unk> funds <unk> says allow agencies like oxfam to use donations for humanitarian crises which are equally important but perhaps not as high impact
there is simply not enough money going into the humanitarian system <unk> says
having donations spread out <unk> <unk> people in south sudan have as much right to aid as a person in the tsunami
for us to be able to <unk> our funds <unk> allows us to deliver our funds in a more <unk> way
the tsunami was one of the first disasters to be <unk> captured on camera and the extent of media coverage makes a <unk> difference to the public and governments opening their <unk> oxfam says
indeed how the media has changed in its representation of natural disasters in the decade between two thousand and four and two thousand and fourteen largely comes down to the growth of social media and access to camera equipped mobile devices <unk> says
the expansion of the number of people who have access to mobile technology focuses it on experience of the individual
in the one thousand nine hundred and ninety s humanitarian crisis survivors <unk> on organizations like oxfam to get the word out but not so much any more
now it is much more personal
<unk> report also highlights the importance of coordination
in two thousand and four the lack of a <unk> plan meant that efforts were <unk> and often involved ngo workers operating outside of their main areas of expertise
oxfam notes that close to two hundred international <unk> operating in <unk> province alone
the charity says that in the aftermath of the tsunami it learned a great deal about <unk> exacerbated by the <unk> of natural disasters
women it <unk> are more likely to die in such circumstances a state of affairs <unk> by poverty
recruiting more female relief workers especially at the coordination level providing safe shelter and <unk> facilities for women and <unk> <unk> activities for women as well as men can reduce this <unk> the report <unk>
having experienced the full <unk> of a disaster of this magnitude the affected countries have been urged to build back better <unk> their own <unk> to <unk> the impact of future events
while the idea of a repeat of a natural disaster of this magnitude is unsettling it is <unk> to know that the lessons of two thousand and four have been <unk> and those aid givers better equipped as a result

here are five signs america may be falling in love with public transportation
the nation is on track to top two thousand and <unk> annual ridership which was the highest since one thousand nine hundred and fifty six
third quarter figures released wednesday from the american public transportation association show rising ridership nationwide for twelve of the past fifteen quarters

that's an increase of one point eight one percents
the increases are happening across the country in cities such as <unk> <unk> and <unk> new york <unk> reports
some cities set records including st. petersburg florida as well as <unk> california
the new figures prove a dramatic change in public attitude as more people are demanding public transportation services said michael <unk> <unk> president and ceo in an e mail to cnn
and while ridership increases <unk> prices are <unk>
this week the national average for a <unk> of regular <unk> gas hit two dollar point fifty five a five year low
you might think falling <unk> prices would result in a big ridership drop off as driving suddenly becomes more affordable
but according to a two thousand and twelve <unk> study when the cost of fuel goes down many riders tend to continue using public transit
the drop off rate from low gas prices doesn't match the ridership increase that happens when gas prices shoot sky high

five men are <unk> freedom for the first time in years including one president barack obama described as one of the most important intelligence agents that the united states has ever had in cuba in a historic deal between the u.s. and cuba announced wednesday
the still unidentified spy was released along with alan gross the american <unk> held for five years in cuba despite <unk> and very public <unk> for his release
the intelligence agent was part of a deal that exchanged him for three convicted cuban spies who are now back home in cuba
all five of the released men are now part of a bigger story one that speaks to the long held <unk> between the united states and cuba that is now being <unk> as the two countries <unk> diplomatic relations
who are these men
what did they do
and what can they look forward to now that they're free
the most significant person to be freed may be the only one who hasn't been named and about whom least is known
he is a u.s. intelligence agent who spent nearly twenty years in a cuban prison before his release
but why
this man whose sacrifice has been known to only a few provided america with the information that led us to arrest the network of cuban agents that included the men transferred to cuba today as well as other spies in the united states obama said wednesday
this man is now safely on our shores
according to the office of the director of national intelligence this cuban national provided the u.s. government with information that was <unk> in the identification and disruption of several cuban intelligence operatives in the united states and ultimately led to
successful federal espionage prosecutions
specifically the u.s. intelligence office tied this <unk> spy to the conviction of one time defense intelligence agency senior analyst <unk> <unk> <unk> who was sentenced to twenty five years after pleading guilty of <unk> for the cuban government in two thousand and two
he's also tied to the case of ex state department official <unk> <unk> <unk> and his wife <unk> who pleaded guilty in two thousand and nine for illegally <unk> the cuban government for decades
the <unk> agent also played a role in helping federal authorities go after the florida based <unk> network including members of the cuban five
three of those five were released in exchange for this intelligence agent as part of wednesday's deal
securing his release from prison after twenty years in a swap for three of the cuban spies he helped put behind bars is <unk> <unk> to this cold world <unk> of u.s. cuban relations the <unk> office said
though the sixty five year old gross has been detained for less time than the others freed as part of the u.s. cuba exchange his plight probably has been the most widely reported thanks to his family's public campaign for his release
a <unk> for the u.s. agency for international development gross went to cuba purportedly to bring the internet to the caribbean nation's small jewish community despite the havana government's restrictions on internet access
his two day march two thousand and eleven trial took place behind closed doors ending with his conviction for allegedly trying to set up an internet network for cuban dissidents to promote <unk> activities and <unk> constitutional order
this month his wife judy gross said her husband spent five years
literally <unk> away
alan is done

while the others were <unk> as part of a deal the cuban government says that gross was let go <unk> on humanitarian grounds
hernandez led the group known as cuban five who were arrested in one thousand nine hundred and ninety eight and convicted of espionage in two thousand and one for gathering intelligence in miami
he got special treatment in u.s. courts two life sentences in fact compared to the others charged
this came after guilty <unk> on charges that included conspiracy to commit murder for engineering the <unk> of two planes flown in one thousand nine hundred and ninety six by the exile group brothers to the rescue
according to the national committee to free the cuban five hernandez and the others were <unk> accused by the u.s. government of committing espionage conspiracy against the united states and other related charges
the <unk> actions were never directed at the u.s. government
that website claims the now forty nine year old havana born hernandez is a cartoonist <unk> and a cuban military veteran who after his conviction was held in a federal prison in <unk> california
he went on fifty four combat missions one of them as part of cuban forces fighting against apartheid era south african forces in <unk>
also known as ramon <unk> medina belonged to the cuban five
during their trial he and others said their mission was to gather intelligence in miami to defend cuba from anti castro groups they feared would attack the island

vital signs is a monthly program bringing viewers health stories from around the world
the mosquito borne chikungunya virus has long been diagnosed in travelers returning from countries in asia and africa where the disease is widespread
but in december two thousand and thirteen the first people infected by <unk> local to the region were reported on the caribbean island of saint martin
this was the first outbreak of the debilitating disease in the western <unk> health officials said
all countries in central america have now reported local transmission of chikungunya pronounced <unk> un <unk> <unk> and the united states had eleven confirmed cases of local infection this year as of december twelve all in florida
there also have been one thousand nine hundred <unk> cases across the united states in returning travelers
it wasn't until two thousand and thirteen that unfortunately a traveler resulted in local transmission of chikungunya said <unk> staples of the u.s. centers for disease control and prevention referring to the people infected in saint martin
those infected carry the virus in their <unk>
it can then be picked up by <unk> as they bite making them carriers
the virus has since spread rapidly and shows no signs of leaving as <unk> conditions are perfect for the disease to flourish
we knew it would spread said staples a medical <unk>
the big question <unk> officials
why now
two mosquito species <unk> to the temperatures of central and south america carry chikungunya
the species <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> also carry the virus behind <unk> <unk>
given the level of <unk> in the region we knew there could be the same levels of chikungunya staples said
both diseases can cause joint pain and <unk> headaches <unk> and <unk> and can lead to death in rare cases
but this tropical disease with an <unk> name causes more intense joint pain and <unk>
for some people the pain can last for months or years resulting in additional psychological strain
the lack of <unk> among people living in the americas provided a blank <unk> for chikungunya to spread throughout the population this year
as of december twelve more than one point zero three million people have been infected in addition to the one hundred and fifty five who died according to the pan american health organization
almost all of the fatalities occurred in the caribbean island countries of <unk> and <unk>
where we saw the biggest jump was after it reached the spanish speaking countries in the region said staples referring to the weakened <unk> and health systems of countries such as the <unk> republic which has reported more than five hundred and twenty thousand cases more than half of the overall outbreak and five percents of the island country's population
as south american countries approach their summer numbers are expected to rise there as the <unk> flourish in the heat
brazil <unk> <unk> are coming into their summer months and reporting their first local transmission staples said
already more than two thousand people have been infected in brazil
is there cause for concern
because infection with chikungunya is rarely fatal the issue of most concern to officials is the burden on health services and the impact of the debilitating symptoms on the economy
the high number of cases can <unk> health services says dr. <unk> ramon <unk> regional adviser for <unk> the regional office of the world health organization
until recently monitoring for chikungunya was not part of routine surveillance in the region
<unk> have to be ready to <unk> she said
about twenty percents to thirty percents of cases are expected to become chronic with symptoms such as <unk> and other <unk> <unk> leading to physical disabilities ramon <unk> said
further long term effects are psychological as people become more <unk> and tired
all of this can result in missed work and lower school <unk> she said hurting local economies
is it here to stay
the warm climate of the region offers potential for chikungunya levels to be maintained for years to come just like <unk> <unk>
but areas of most concern are the <unk>
the areas which have year round favorable climate for the mosquito are at the greatest risk says dr. <unk> <unk> of the london school of hygiene and tropical medicine which is monitoring the spread of the outbreak
while the climate and <unk> have long been present ramon <unk> said we don't know why this is happening now
she said <unk> is likely to blame with increased population movement from one country to another
this offers more opportunities for local <unk> to bite infected humans
the <unk> staples said she is temporarily at ease regarding numbers in the u.s. we're moving into fall and winter <unk> which should see activity <unk> she said
cold temperatures reduce mosquito survival rates
the rapid spread of chikungunya this year also could help <unk> future infections
chikungunya will go through a region quite rapidly and create a level of population <unk> which helps mitigate large outbreaks of the disease staples said
unlike <unk> infection with chikungunya results in <unk> <unk>
like many other infections chikungunya could however remain in the background through animals capable of carrying the virus in their <unk> and acting as so called <unk> of the disease
in asia and africa there is a transmission cycle in small <unk> and monkeys ramon <unk> said meaning these animals keep the virus present within the population
in the americas
we don't know yet
those words we don't know <unk> throughout the community of scientists and government officials trying to control the outbreak
the future risk of spread levels of future <unk> risk from animal <unk> why this is only happening now and the total economic impact are all unknown
<unk> models are under construction by numerous research groups around the world to improve confidence over <unk> of future spread said <unk> whose team is <unk> the disease
as they work control efforts continue
getting it under control
when it comes to controlling chikungunya there are two main <unk> reduce the <unk> of <unk> and remove the ever <unk> mosquito
prevention is the priority
unlike the <unk> behind <unk> which bite at night the species behind chikungunya bite any time day or night
those living in affected areas are asked to use <unk> sleep under bed <unk> and wear long clothing to avoid getting <unk>

after losing hope and health in cuba gross finally released
senior administration officials and cuba observers have said recent reforms on the island and changing attitudes in the united states have created an opening for improved relations
u.s. and cuban officials say washington and havana in recent months have increased official technical level contacts on a variety of issues
obama publicly acknowledged for the first time last week that washington was negotiating with havana for gross release through a variety of channels
we've been in conversations about how we can get alan gross home for quite some time obama said in an interview with <unk> television network
we continue to be concerned about him

his <unk> are so weak that he can barely walk and he has lost vision in one eye
he has also <unk> hunger strikes and threatened to take his own life
with gross health in decline a <unk> group of sixty six <unk> wrote obama a letter in november two thousand and thirteen urging him to act <unk> to take whatever steps are in the national interest to obtain <unk> release
the three cubans released as a part of the deal belonged the so called cuban five a <unk> of cuban intelligence officers convicted in two thousand and one for espionage
they were part of what was called the <unk> network which collected intelligence on prominent cuban american exile leaders and u.s. military bases
the leader of the five <unk> hernandez was linked to the february one thousand nine hundred and ninety six <unk> of the two civilian planes operated by the u.s. based <unk> group brothers to the rescue in which four men died
he is serving a two life sentences
luis medina also known as ramon <unk>
and <unk> guerrero have just a few years left on their sentences
the remaining two <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> were released after serving most of their fifteen year sentences and have already returned to cuba where they were hailed as heroes
wednesday's announcement that the u.s. will move toward <unk> diplomatic ties with cuba will also make it easier for americans to travel to cuba and do business with the cuban people by <unk> general <unk> officials said
while the more liberal travel restrictions won't allow for tourism they will permit greater american travel to the island
secretary of state john kerry has also been <unk> to review cuba's place on the state <unk> of terrorism list potentially <unk> the the way a lift on certain economic and political sanctions
the <unk> relationship between the u.s. and cuba comes ahead of the march two thousand and fifteen summit of the americas where the island country is set to participate for the first time

this year several countries have said they would not participate if cuba was once again <unk>
while only congress can <unk> <unk> the five decades long embargo the white house has some authorities to <unk> trade and travel to the island

<unk> by americans to their families back in cuba will also be increased to approximately two thousand dollar per quarter
officials stressed the moves were not being <unk> to <unk> up the castro regime but rather to encourage further reforms on the island
none of this is seen as a reward
all of this is seen as a way of promoting change in cuba because everything we have done in the past has <unk> failed another senior administration official said
this is not the u.s. government saying cuba has gotten so much better
it is still an <unk> state and we still have profound differences with this government
but if we hope for change with cuba we must try for a different approach
and we believe that <unk> more <unk> with the cuban people and the cuban government is the way to do that the official said adding that the united states will not for a moment <unk> our support for improvement in human rights
to that end cuba has agreed to release fifty three political prisoners from a list of names provided by the united states
at least one of the prisoners has already been released

officials would not reveal the name of the u.s. intelligence source but officials said he was the individual who revealed to the u.s. the <unk> network which included the cuban five
he was a very important hero the u.s. official said
the moves are far more sweeping than the last action obama took toward cuba in january two thousand and eleven when he <unk> restrictions on travel to and from the island
relations have been largely frozen since gross conviction and the white house has made his release a condition of improved ties
in two thousand and thirteen obama drew <unk> from advocates of changing u.s. policy toward cuba when he said the u.s. had to be creative and <unk> about <unk> change on the island
the notion that the same policies that we put in place in one thousand nine hundred and sixty one would somehow still be as effective as they are today in the age of the internet and google and world travel doesn't make sense obama said at a november two thousand and thirteen <unk> in florida
we have to continue to update our policies

the gunman behind the deadly siege of a cafe in sydney this week was not on a security watch list and australia's prime minister wants to know why
tony abbott said wednesday that the system fell short
there's no doubt about that and this is why we've got to constantly learn the lessons of everything that happens he told the australian <unk> <unk>
we've got to be constantly asking ourselves
is this the best we can do
and <unk> we've got to always be better at this because if we aren't good at this our people suffer
and the tragedy of this <unk> is that two <unk> australians two very <unk> people are dead
others are injured
others are <unk> because of a <unk> who was roaming our streets the prime minister said
his office announced that authorities will carry out an urgent review into the hostage taking and what lessons can be learned from the events leading up to and surrounding the siege
at a news conference later wednesday abbott told australians i will not rest until i am confident that you are as safe as any government can possibly make you
a report on the conclusions of the review is due by the end of january
authorities have identified the gunman as man haron monis an iranian born refugee who was granted political asylum in australia
he seized control of the lindt chocolate cafe in the heart of <unk> central business district and held it for some sixteen hours
the siege ended when police stormed the cafe early tuesday

he had a long history of mental illness and violence the prime minister said
this was the act of someone who was way beyond any mainstream any mainstream and has been <unk> absolutely <unk> by all the communities of australia abbott told the australian broadcaster
we want to know why he wasn't being monitored given his history of violence his history of mental instability and his history of <unk> with extremism
at the news conference in <unk> later in the day he also raised questions about how monis was able to obtain permanent <unk> in australia as well as welfare benefits
i share the <unk> of the australian public at what appears to be someone who's been having a <unk> of us for many years abbott told reporters
he also said that the gunman had a <unk> <unk> but the australian federal police later <unk> that that wasn't true
the federal police who had originally given abbott the erroneous information said the confusion <unk> from an entry in a national database that was now being investigated
at the news conference abbott said he also wanted to know why monis seemed to have fallen off australian security agencies watch lists in two thousand and nine
but he offered little in the way of details about what took place in the final hours of the siege
when you are in a firefight all sorts of things happen abbott told reporters
the important thing for the police in a situation like that is to take care of the terrorist as quickly as possible
he said that on the <unk> advice he had refused to act on the <unk> demand to talk to him during the siege
as authorities work to find the answer to that and other unanswered questions a makeshift memorial has <unk> up in sydney as people come to pay tribute to the victims

poster child of the movement holiday <unk> site <unk> currently has six million guests in one hundred and ninety countries
some of that growth has come from word of mouth according to <unk> <unk>
people might have been <unk> but then they hear of who have had a positive experience or not and they are more <unk> to try it out she says
what we're all likely to be doing a lot more next year is eating with the locals not in restaurants but in their homes according to the <unk> global trends report two thousand and fourteen
sites like <unk> dot com which <unk> travelers with home <unk> and <unk> dot com a network of locals who offer <unk> and <unk> classes are rapidly expanding
my best travel experiences have always involved having a local person on the ground so i set out to launch a platform where travelers could connect with local people says <unk> dot com founder <unk> white in the report

they almost wouldn't even let me bring the camera inside cristofoletti recalled
he was able to bring his camera inside however and when he saw a woman shopping in a colorful <unk> <unk> he made a <unk> click of the <unk>
i was able to take that one without looking he said of an image he made for his series exploring western style <unk> in iran
a former advertising director in italy and spain cristofoletti left the profession behind four years ago and moved to cambodia to pursue photography
he founded <unk> a collective of journalists who <unk> in social <unk> in southeast asia
last year cristofoletti got the opportunity to visit friends working as graphic designers in iran and he jumped on the chance to see what daily life is like there
i've always been interested in closed countries he said
i got this great opportunity to be there with locals
you are able to see things in a very different way
during <unk> <unk> stay in iran he began to notice the differences in the way iranians live their public and private lives
he realized that daily life in iran <unk> the way iran is typically portrayed
the perception we have is not real he said
my idea was to try to see with my eyes what is the reality of iran
cristofoletti chose to show this new reality by documenting the increasing presence of western style <unk> in a country <unk> in tradition
his photos <unk> typical iranian markets with modern <unk> lit shopping malls
even if traditional grand <unk> continue to be the favorite places to shop for regular iranians they now face competition from huge shopping malls which were <unk> in the outskirts of major cities across the country cristofoletti said
the malls feature <unk> international brands and vibrant video game <unk> as a kind of alternative entertainment
i was really surprised to see these kind of modern stores and malls he said
shopping has become a near <unk> ritual for young people
cristofoletti notes that for women especially some aspects of western culture are particularly <unk>
he found that because iranian women are prohibited from showing any part of their body except for the face they have taken to buying high end beauty products and <unk> plastic surgery to make their features look more european or american
it is through these measures cristofoletti said that women are able to rebel against government imposed restrictions
cristofoletti was aware of certain <unk> to life in iran and he <unk> with a journalist there before his trip who advised him that it was safer to go as just a tourist rather than as a journalist
he said it could cause a problem for the person that is helping you cristofoletti said
<unk> was a <unk> subject because it was right in front of him
it just <unk> into my mind when i started seeing it he said
it was a natural process
i spent a lot of time in the malls and just acted like a normal tourist
don't see you as a problem
cristofoletti wants his project to change the way people around the world think about iran
it's no different from our country he said
there is this will of the people to be free
they want to express themselves
you just need to find the right angle he added and see everything in perspective

<unk> <unk> a recent graduate of harvard college is his research assistant
the opinions expressed in this commentary are theirs
there can be life after death or at least in american politics as we have just seen with the u.s. <unk> approval of dr. <unk> murthy as the next u.s. surgeon general
it's a small political miracle that promises to serve the nation well over the next two years
when president barack obama first nominated dr. murthy thirteen months ago leading public <unk> officials <unk> applauded
he was a fresh dynamic young doctor who had <unk> himself by <unk> out better ways to serve low income patients in poor neighborhoods
but opposition quickly mounted outside the medical community
republicans had held up his candidacy on two grounds
they said that at age thirty seven he was too young and <unk> for the post
more <unk> they <unk> to the national rifle association which <unk> opposed murthy because he had the <unk> to say that guns are a public health issue
republicans were wrong on both counts
the point is that the <unk> remains an extraordinary force in our politics
as it <unk> up opposition a good number of democratic <unk> especially those up for re election this past november soon <unk> to the <unk> too
the white house continued to give murthy quiet support but <unk> a public fight
<unk> nomination went into a <unk> and has seemed <unk> since april
but then a strange thing happened by beginning debate on a point of order against obama's immigration executive order republican sen. <unk> <unk> gave majority leader harry <unk> the opportunity to call a special session and put two dozen stalled obama <unk> on the agenda for confirmation before the senate <unk>
as a result murthy was confirmed monday afternoon as the <unk> u.s
surgeon general monday afternoon by a fifty one forty three vote
some months ago one of us had a chance to sit down with murthy for a lengthy conversation about his background and his hopes as a possible surgeon general
we also explored his leadership capabilities with others in his generation
what emerged was a portrait of a doctor who not only has the <unk> of experience necessary but also the quality of experience
he is a <unk> advocate for <unk> in health <unk> whose focus in the job will be on <unk> smoking <unk> and mental health pressing health concerns that often break down along <unk> and <unk> lines
not only will he be excellent at managing imminent public health crises but he also promises to be a solutions <unk> data driven leader on some of this country's most <unk> health problems
as dr. paul farmer a harvard university professor and founder of partners in health has said
dr. <unk> murthy has long experience in community based care in <unk> complex messages in a <unk> and even handed manner and is committed not just to passing on information to others but to learning from them too
it is also important to recognize that murthy has the <unk> support of the medical community having been <unk> by the american academy of <unk> the american medical association and the american cancer society
as we saw with the ebola crisis the nation needs a strong public health leader to step into a post that's been <unk> too long
americans were and remain <unk> about <unk> requirements and how much risk ebola poses
people didn't understand why government officials were not <unk> <unk> for everyone who had been in contact with ebola patients
this recent crisis highlights the need for a visible surgeon general who can educate the public during health <unk>
as opposed to the centers for disease control and prevention and the national <unk> of health two agencies primarily concerned with academic research the role of the surgeon general is to be the leading spokesperson on matters of public health in the united states the country's doctor who can be <unk> by rich and poor alike
the ebola crisis demanded a public health official capable of leading in crisis <unk> american families that they were safe and <unk> for necessary <unk>
the leadership vacuum is partly responsible for the government's initial <unk> on ebola and demonstrates just how important <unk> confirmation is
if he goes down the post could be <unk> for another year or perhaps even two
the root of the <unk> opposition to murthy and the subsequent political <unk> to stall his nomination <unk> from an october two thousand and twelve tweet in which he wrote guns are a health care issue
he was right guns are a public health issue
we once thought <unk> were outside the <unk> of anything but the food and drug administration but soon realized that they were a huge health issue
guns are too particularly when over seven thousand young people under age twenty are admitted to u.s. hospitals every year because of <unk> injuries about twenty a day
it is entirely reasonable for the <unk> to stand up for its beliefs in people's rights under the second <unk> this country should always welcome <unk> debate about rights
but the gun lobby should not hold a <unk> power over what is best to protect the public health of our citizens
doctors are right to speak out after treating so many gun victims in emergency rooms across the country
primary care <unk> are right to ask families if they have guns in their homes
a lot of young lives can be saved
it was especially <unk> if the u.s. senate were to <unk> murthy on monday just a day after the second anniversary of the <unk> <unk> <unk> school shooting in <unk> <unk>

editor's note
<unk> <unk> <unk> the nine a.m. to eleven a.m
et edition of cnn's newsroom each <unk>
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author
would you rather be sexy or smart
i hate that <unk> question
of course you'd rather be smart
although just the other day <unk> sterling a <unk> engineering graduate and successful entrepreneur told me growing up as a little girl i was always very smart and i got good <unk> but i always wanted people to tell me that i was pretty
like to me that was the ultimate success
sexy sells
it can make you rich
and <unk> successful
it wasn't kim's brain that launched the <unk> empire
wait i hear you
kim is smart
she turned a sex tape into a hit reality tv show
she developed a cosmetics line
she tried to break the internet
but it's not like kim goes around urging little girls to use their <unk>
she is sending them a decidedly different kind of message
so again how would you answer sexy or smart
<unk> pollack who was one of the first women to earn a <unk> degree in physics from <unk> is writing a book called the only woman in the room
why science is still a boy's club
it aims to expose factors that impact women's access to careers in science technology engineering and <unk> the fields known <unk> as <unk>
she had this to say
first of all that the question would even be asked i can see all the anxiety that it poses
why is that even a question
why isn't it <unk> that they can be both
this isn't a <unk> of your question because that question is the story of my life
i can understand that
pollack as a <unk> physics <unk> isn't speaking to us from the grave but from the heart
why is it she <unk> when girls reach the age of six <unk> take a back seat to beauty even if they have both
if it's your professor or <unk> i <unk> you want to be smart pollack said
but not if there is a guy in the room
in america <unk> boyfriend wants them to be <unk> than he is and no one wants to admit it
<unk> the <unk>
if kim <unk> really is smart then why is her husband music <unk> <unk> west now <unk> controlling her empire
even if that's not true the narrative exists and it says something about how girls may in their heart of hearts answer that question
sterling and i talked about how to <unk> more girls to <unk> the kim princess route and <unk> in their natural curiosity
it's why sterling created her toy company <unk>
growing up as a little girl i certainly had no interest in becoming a scientist or <unk> or engineer sterling said
i thought it was a boys only club for <unk>
and i <unk> this old white man in a lab <unk> with no friends
<unk> the <unk> who rules the <unk> world isn't beautiful like princess <unk> not sexy like <unk> but <unk> <unk> and <unk> like sterling herself
and when i say <unk> i don't mean like the <unk> women on the big <unk> theory
i don't think many little girls <unk> to be like <unk> or <unk>
sexy <unk> the day on that show
<unk> a community college <unk> is <unk> and <unk> well <unk>
but she is sexy
and she <unk> <unk> the sexy brilliant male <unk>
<unk> <unk>
poor <unk> is stuck with <unk> a man <unk> once described as <unk>
and <unk>
well
i bring up the big <unk> theory and <unk> it in with kim <unk> because both send a strong message to <unk> girls and to the rest of us
i'm not saying they are solely to blame for the <unk> how site that <unk> girls to be smart without being <unk> but something in our culture is causing girls to tune out <unk> and science
in many countries girls now <unk> boys in science but not in the united states according to a study by the <unk> for economic cooperation and development reported by the new york times
sterling says that means it's a cultural issue in the united states rather than a gender one
just look at <unk> gianotti
she is a physicist from milan italy
gianotti was just elected to lead the most prestigious <unk> physics research center in the world <unk>
or as <unk> fair describes it a nine billion dollar cathedral of science that could <unk> the secrets of the universe
i grew up in environment that had more women in science gianotti told me
when i asked her the sexy smart question she sounded <unk>
i hope women and men in general value their brain
the brain is much more useful in life than beauty
<unk> gianotti sees physics in a decidedly <unk> way
i like the beauty of physics she told me
nature is beautiful it is my second soul to music
when i asked her who inspired her gianotti did not <unk>
marie <unk> the nobel prize winning physicist who <unk> <unk> is her idol
she had a domestic way of doing physics gianotti told me
she had a lab in her house
she could prepare dinner in her kitchen then move into her lab
she could have a normal life
really amazing
note gianotti said a normal life
that's important because american girls like normal
pollack points to a two thousand and ten american <unk> society study that determined why so few women in the united states became <unk> <unk> or computer scientists to prove the point
one reason and i stress only one is that girls are not attracted to the <unk> <unk> image associated with the <unk>
they find the culture <unk>
parents don't want their kids to be <unk> pollack told me
for women even if she's <unk> enough to be steve jobs she's <unk>
see it all comes back to that not so easy question
there's still this <unk> version of being too smart in anything pollack continued
you have to look like a <unk> star in eighth grade
there's this huge <unk> with <unk> being a princess a <unk>
maybe <unk> little <unk> <unk> who actively <unk> america's cultural definition of beauty in online videos can help
in <unk> <unk> the big sister machine a woman states
you are beauty and beauty is <unk>
<unk> dressed little girls walk the <unk> as another little girl in <unk> <unk> that <unk> out of the water
as sterling puts it i was hoping that if girls looked at <unk> and they wanted to be like her and do what she does they might value their <unk> as much as their beauty
so sexy or smart
come on ask your daughter which is more important
then ask her why
editor's note
actress <unk> <unk> is a global ambassador for oxfam an international relief and development organization and has made three trips to south sudan
the opinions expressed in this commentary are <unk>
when most people think of south sudan if they think of it at all they imagine poverty and war
they imagine a world and people that are far removed from the everyday life that most of us reading this are lucky enough to enjoy
but that was not my experience in the world's youngest nation
what i saw on my three trips through south sudan were people just like you and me
people with <unk> and needs
people in love
mothers and fathers
sisters and brothers
friends and enemies
people with <unk> determination
but above all hope
a year ago monday conflict again erupted in south sudan
since then thousands of people have been killed nearly two million people have been forced to flee their homes and six million south sudanese almost half the country have found themselves in desperate need of aid
last week as i traveled through <unk> a small village in south <unk> <unk> state with the aid organization oxfam i met people whose lives have been turned <unk> down by conflict over the last year but who still haven't lost their belief that things can get better
at a camp for people who had crossed the <unk> to escape the violence that destroyed their homes a middle aged <unk> man who was easily seven feet tall told me that armed men had stolen all of his <unk> his main source of income
when i offered my sympathy for his loss he <unk> and said don't worry i will get more <unk>
indeed much of the story of south sudan is a story of hope
when the country gained independence in two thousand and eleven after more than half a century of war people <unk> and cried with joy in the streets as they looked forward to a future of peace and development
cnn photos
a nation on the brink of an <unk>
through the <unk> efforts of the south sudanese people and support from the international community and organizations like oxfam things were getting better
new roads were <unk> communities without access to clean water saw <unk> <unk> and violence was <unk> reduced
tens of thousands of young girls were receiving education for the first time
things were changing for the better
but then last december a power struggle between the country's president and vice president turned violent and led to a <unk> between some of their supporters that has <unk> havoc across the country
church leaders and civil society groups have appealed for peace and reconciliation
people i met are opposed to and terrified by what's happening
but as the <unk> rains have ended and the roads are once again <unk> the fighting has resumed and is likely to get worse in the coming weeks
although the conflict has taken on an ethnic tone people i spoke with were at <unk> to tell me that this wasn't a conflict between the <unk> and <unk> tribes who have lived together worked together and <unk> for generations
standing in the midst of rows of newly <unk> <unk> one <unk> man took a break from <unk> to tell me that he believed in a peaceful future for south sudan but not without greater action from the international community
when you have problems within your family he told me you sometimes can't solve it yourself
you need someone from outside to come in and help you <unk>
his words were echoed by so many south sudanese i spoke with who highlighted the special role of the united states in helping the country achieve peace and gain its independence and asked for america's assistance again now
as we mark one year since the start of this terrible conflict we have to do more to support south sudanese <unk> and pressure the country's leaders to stop fighting
the <unk> of the people of south sudan can only go so far without a political solution to this conflict
even now when i think of south sudan i don't think of war
i don't think of poverty and children with ak forty seven s. all of this exists within the country but i think of the confident cattle <unk> who believes he will <unk> his lost <unk> even in the face of such despair
i think of the many pregnant young women i met who were excited for their future and the future of their children hoping that it would include peace and a chance for a good education
but most of all i think about the many incredible people i met who have lost everything they have in the world but still manage to keep going and keep hoping for peace
it is for those people that the u.s. must act to keep that hope alive
we all know the feeling
you are going about your day making phone calls and <unk> when suddenly your <unk> battery starts to look <unk> low
you don't have a <unk> with you and even if you did there would be nowhere to <unk> it in
for most people this means spending a few hours <unk> but not for residents of several towns and cities in serbia
they can charge their phones on the go thanks to strawberry tree the first of its kind public solar powered <unk> station installed in parks and <unk> across the country
<unk> by <unk> milisavljevic in two thousand and eleven while he was still a student at belgrade university strawberry tree contains sixteen <unk> for a variety of mobile phones and <unk> as well as its own <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
his creation won the <unk> <unk> <unk> competition in san <unk> at the end of october the only company from outside america to take part and already boasts the european union sustainable energy award
we rely heavily on our cell phones for many essential tasks during the day says milisavljevic now twenty six who founded his company strawberry energy when he received the first order for his <unk>
you communicate over your cell phone you are using <unk> taking photos so basically your phone becomes your life
it's a huge problem when you run out of battery because then you are just carrying a <unk> in your pocket he adds
strawberry tree named so after the <unk> of <unk> as the first <unk> of the summer can work for up to twenty days without <unk> thanks to its in built solar batteries
it contains <unk> steel and ninety eight percents of it can be <unk>
i was fascinated with clean technology and i wanted to find a way that it could benefit people in their everyday life by <unk> a common problem running out of battery says milisavljevic
while <unk> cell phone batteries is the <unk> main function milisavljevic wants strawberry tree to become a core <unk> of infrastructure in what he calls a smart connected city of the future
each <unk> is equipped with sensors which measure conditions like air pollution noise levels and <unk> radiation in its <unk>
milisavljevic says he hopes these sensors could in the future enable people to access locally focused environmental data though an app on their smartphone
for example if you had a network of strawberry trees spread around the city you could check if there's ice on the road in your street what park is the <unk> if you want to relax explains milisavljevic or if you have <unk> or <unk> you could see what's the air quality in the area you're planning to go to he adds
the company's ambitious plans don't stop there
after serbia was hit by devastating floods in may large <unk> of the country lost power preventing many people from <unk> their families for several days
milisavljevic thinks that his creation could become an <unk> resource in similar scenarios
strawberry tree could have an emergency <unk> which would send a signal to emergency services that you are in danger and in any kind of a disaster for example if the power <unk> is down the tree would be the place where you could call for help and get in touch with your loved ones he adds
milisavljevic also <unk> that in spite of the dramatic changes in the way that people communicate in the last fifty years cities have remained almost frozen in time
street signs are still street signs city lights are only city lights and benches are still just benches
there is hardly any innovation in city living so our dream is to bring new technology to outdoor public spaces so we can improve the quality of life in our cities he says

what is europe's best festival
more from on the road serbia
if sport were a religion then the stadium would surely be its place of worship
inside these <unk> to physical <unk> language <unk> the divine <unk> fans pray for a miracle while losing <unk> serious soul searching
so much so that architects these days must create more than a stage for human <unk>
it's as if they have been asked to perform the architectural equivalent of feeding the five thousand with five <unk> and two fish <unk> an arena to <unk> the <unk> capture the spirit of a community and become an icon for a city long after the last fan has passed through the <unk>
it's like creating a contemporary cathedral in some ways said <unk> <unk> architect behind the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> arena home to the belarus national football team
often the stadium is meant to become the pride of a city a landmark object and as such a monument representing the latest achievements in architecture
since ancient <unk> built the first olympic stadium in fine white <unk> the arena has been as much about inspiring awe as staging competition
today's architects must go even further
in an age where sporting events are captured on television in brilliant detail designers must <unk> us from the comfort of living rooms with <unk> entertainment centers
no longer <unk> to the outskirts of town these modern day social hubs are <unk> inside our <unk> once more and they have more in common with historic <unk> than you might think
look at the ancient greek and roman stadiums they're very much in the middle of the city said <unk> <unk> veteran german architect behind the <unk> berlin olympic stadium and amazon arena at this year's world cup in brazil
but in the last fifty years the stadium became something that was not really integrated they were built outside the cities
they were for people who went there perhaps once a week for an event
while <unk> like the <unk> in the heart of rome occupy real estate today's architects could only dream of we may soon see a return to <unk> social spaces of old says <unk>
now we're bringing in multiple uses for stadiums again like shops and conference <unk> he said
in the future they will not be outside the city but something like the <unk> of the middle ages they will be a vital part of city life
a key part of this vision however will depend on improved transport infrastructure
in the future they will not be outside the city but something like the <unk> of the middle ages they will be a vital part of city life there was a trend back in the one thousand nine hundred and eighty s of treating stadiums a bit like shopping centers
so you'd try and put them on the <unk> of cities said architect <unk> <unk> designer behind the singapore national stadium and sports hub and winner at this year's world architecture festival award
but more and more it's important to make a stadium that's part of the city
they need to be integrated into the transport infrastructure so they're a naturally connected part of the city the event should start as soon as you leave your house
he goes one step further with a vision of one roof to house all of humanity
for me stadiums have taken over the function of a cathedral
it's a building that brings together people of all ages all cultures all religions
and the only other thing that comes close to that is an airport
at the heart of an arena both physically and <unk> is its playing area
and with the outcome of <unk> dollar matches riding on everything from grass quality to the position of the sun designers must get it pitch perfect
does that mean architects need to be sports fans themselves
do we need to be religious to build a church
we don't think so comes the <unk> from <unk> architects the company behind the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk>
architects must be able to project themselves and think as if they were the final users of the space they're designing
do we need to be religious to build a church
we don't think so and long after the grand final <unk> have been handed out an arena must serve its people for decades to come
whether we're designing for the olympics or the world cup we're always actually thinking ahead to what we're going to do with the venue after that event said <unk> whose singapore sports hub hopes to hold two hundred events every year
and i think there's a history in recent years of relatively few examples that have done that very well
perhaps the most striking example of this failure is athens
the greek capital may be the home of the modern olympics but over a century later its two thousand and four <unk> has become a modern ruin of its own with venues <unk> with <unk> walls covered in graffiti and <unk> <unk> away
it's an eye <unk> death for an event which cost the country around eleven billion dollar to host
step inside today's stadiums and you'll find an entertainment <unk> where fans are encouraged to dig deep into their pockets long before the first kick off
over the last fifty years corporate interests have changed stadiums more than anything else
years ago stadiums were just bare concrete and no seats just <unk> said <unk>
today it's a lot more about the corporate experience the internal <unk> corporate boxes restaurants
which means that people are coming to the venue an hour or two before the event and not leaving for an hour or two afterwards
over the last fifty years corporate interests have changed stadiums more than anything else the goal for stadium owners is to create an icon for the city one <unk> of their name <unk> across it in bright lights
the mayor asked us for something that would put <unk> on the map says <unk> of the <unk> <unk> stadium in <unk> built for the two thousand and ten south african world cup
if you looked at <unk> from the <unk> there was nothing you could remember specifically from the <unk>
that was before <unk> <unk> white arena was built on the <unk> its <unk> three hundred and fifty meter <unk> entrance and <unk> roof a sight to <unk>
but before <unk> even puts pen to paper one of the first places he looks for inspiration is nature
with its <unk> <unk> the amazon arena built in <unk> for the world up in brazil this year <unk> much from the surrounding <unk>
if you look into the structures of nature like a <unk> or the skin of a <unk> there's always a <unk> system behind it explained <unk>
<unk> is in the middle of a <unk> so that's where we turned for inspiration
we're really trying to design something that's only meant for this one place
like nature itself these modern day <unk> of <unk> will also need to <unk> themselves in order to survive

<unk> of the future in your dreams
once a year if you drive just several hours north of cape town into south africa's <unk> karoo <unk> desert you'll come across a <unk> town in the middle of a vast <unk> of nothing like a surreal <unk>
here huge sculptures <unk> the sky and the desert floor is dotted with art works from multi story <unk> to a field of tiny <unk> that light up at night
thousands of people looking like <unk> from a hundred different movie sets wear elaborate costumes and body paint and <unk> around giving out hot dogs <unk> drinks ice <unk> and <unk> lessons
there's a circus a post office a <unk> house filled with sweets a swiss <unk> <unk> a <unk> straight out of the wild west and nearly a hundred other themed camps including dance floors bars and coffee stations
this is afrikaburn africa's most unique unusual <unk> and mind <unk> festival
based on burning man which draws seventy thousand participants to <unk> black rock desert each year afrikaburn is not just a music or arts festival
the event held at the end of april is a chance to experience a different world where creativity self <unk> self expression and <unk> effort are <unk>
other than ice there's nothing to buy and each <unk> has to bring everything they need to survive including shelter water and food
it's run on a <unk> rather than <unk> economy where each person is supposed to contribute something as a gift and all the entertainment and art is <unk> of created and produced by the participants themselves
over the last three nights of the week long event the art works burn in <unk> fiery <unk>
when it's all over everything is packed up leaving no trace that this parallel universe ever <unk>
afrikaburn has been running for nine years increasing in size each year nine thousand people attended the two thousand and fourteen event
out of one hundred and thirty regional events scattered across the globe affiliated with burning man it's the largest
its worldwide fame is growing too each year more international participants travel to this remote corner of south africa just to attend the festival including americans many of whom declare that afrikaburn is how burning man was two decades ago before it became so big
for many participants attending afrikaburn is a life changing experience it's hard to come out of a week in the desert without looking at the world in a different way
one <unk> for sure
it's definitely worth traveling to south africa for
here are twelve reasons why you should attend the next afrikaburn which takes place in april two thousand and fifteen
more
the <unk> city in south africa you've never seen
the creativity and effort that goes into the art works of afrikaburn is simply <unk>
some like <unk> made up of six <unk> <unk> rising up as high as one hundred feet a statement against <unk> in the karoo have a political stance
others such as reflection a giant wooden construction of a man's <unk> arms and face rising out of the ground which became the backdrop of a laser and <unk> <unk> show are just incredibly beautiful structures
smaller art works are also created to inspire a <unk> sense of <unk> think a telephone <unk> where you can call god and a <unk> made of <unk>
afrikaburn is run on eleven <unk> principles which act like a <unk> and a kind of constitutional self governing law
one of these principles is participation everyone who <unk> afrikaburn is expected to get involved in some way
most people take part by dressing in elaborate costumes others run a bar or a dance floor others create art or help build something and around one thousand each year sign up as volunteers
by participating in afrikaburn everyone becomes part of the event and it's a lot more fun than just being a <unk>
for many watching the spectacle of giant art works burning with a crowd of thousands <unk> in awe in union is a major highlight of afrikaburn
there's something <unk> <unk> about being close to a huge <unk> and something deeply profound in the fiery destruction of art that took months to create
the <unk> are beautiful and spectacular but on a deeper level they speak to ideas of <unk> and presence

six super cool restaurants in africa
it's extremely <unk> to spend a week without taking out your <unk> but what's even more amazing is <unk> the generosity of strangers at afrikaburn
the idea is that everyone gives out <unk> gifts it's <unk> to receive unexpected <unk>
even more so to give out the gifts that you've brought
those attending afrikaburn get a taste of what it's like to survive in an <unk> environment of heat cold wind and dust storms that leave a <unk> of sand over everything
they need to bring a tent <unk> food over a gas <unk> and <unk> water use
there are <unk> but no <unk> and nowhere to buy water
going into survival mode is part of the fun of afrikaburn and it also means that when participants get back into civilization they'll hopefully learn to look at the <unk> things like running water out of a tap with new found appreciation
set around a big circle known as the <unk> are over one hundred theme camps public spaces that all offer something different and form the key components of the festival
there are <unk> <unk> chill spaces photo <unk> <unk> bars a general store post office and even a swimming pool
each year they're different so you never know what to expect
at night afrikaburn turns into one giant party as music blasts from dozens of small big and almost hidden dance floors
expect to hear an <unk> range of <unk> everything from <unk> hop and <unk> to <unk> and deep house and catch some of south africa's best djs playing sets
most people bring <unk> to afrikaburn to get around the event is spread over a large area
but the best methods of transportation are the many <unk> vehicles or art cars that <unk> the desert town with no set route or direction
visitors can jump onto the back of a big purple <unk> a <unk> or a rhino or sail across the <unk> in a <unk> ship
not many tourists <unk> into the northern cape south africa's largest and most <unk> populated province but they're missing out on the <unk> beautiful desert landscapes of the karoo
afrikaburn is set on a farm alongside the <unk> karoo national park an <unk> reserve that's well worth a visit on the way back to cape town

tickets are ninety five dollar
the first round of nine thousand eight hundred tickets goes on sale december nineteen two thousand and fourteen at ten zero <unk> and the second round goes on sale on january thirty two thousand and fifteen at the same time
cape town is the closest city to afrikaburn a four hour drive away on a highway and then a rough dirt road
participants will need to bring all their own supplies to the event

oslo norway at a prize ceremony <unk> peace <unk> corts says violence and injustice sent him <unk> toward the stage
in a matter of seconds the twenty one year old mexican <unk> face was seen around the world last week as he stood in front of malala yousafzai at the nobel peace prize ceremony in oslo norway
please malala mexico he repeated as he <unk> a mexican flag on the stage at <unk> city hall where the seventeen year old <unk> was about to become the youngest person ever to receive the prestigious award
oslo police have come under fire over the incident with critics asking how someone who wasn't on the <unk> guest list managed to slip through security <unk> and make it to the front of the room standing just steps away from yousafzai and other dignitaries before security <unk> him out of the auditorium
speaking to cnn at an oslo detention center on sunday corts said he knows it was a <unk> move
but he felt like he had no choice and wanted only a few seconds to speak about mexico's problems on a global stage
my motivation was to show solidarity with all the things that have happened in my country ultimately well the forty three missing students who are suspected to be dead and burned that was my main motivation he said
i am tired of so many <unk> that we have lived in mexico for decades
the students case has sparked national outrage in mexico and drawn global attention to the country's continued struggles to deal with police corruption and drug related violence
authorities have said the students from a rural teachers college were <unk> up on the orders of a local mayor then delivered to the drug gang to be executed
mexico's attorney general says the students remains were burned at a <unk> placed inside plastic bags and thrown into a river

i was really nervous

oslo police said corts had been fined fifteen thousand <unk> for <unk> and for entering the city hall illegally
even critics who question the <unk> of <unk> the nobel ceremony would have done the same thing he said if they had a little bit of empathy toward what all the families of so many people who have been killed and disappeared in mexico have felt this desperation and this <unk> to not have a way to express themselves and demand justice

katrina dawson was having a monday morning coffee with a colleague at the cafe down the street from their law <unk> office when the nightmare began
the thirty eight year old mother of three was among seventeen people taken hostage by a gun wielding man with extremist muslim views who seized control of the lindt chocolate cafe in the heart of <unk> central business district
the siege last around sixteen hours before police stormed the cafe in the middle of the night

after the two victims identities were revealed tuesday morning <unk> began to <unk> in
these were <unk> good people who were going about their ordinary lives australian prime minister tony abbott said
it's about as innocent a thing as anyone can do to go and grab a cup of coffee before the working day has fully started
what we know what we don't know
we are so proud of our beautiful boy tori gone from this earth but forever in our memories as the most amazing life partner son and brother we could ever wish for johnson's family said in a statement
the thirty four year old had worked for lindt for more than two years the company said
he was a great ambassador for our company and the store that he managed which he <unk> about <unk> said lindt chief executive stephen <unk>
he was a dedicated professional who always built a great <unk> with his customers and was much loved by the lindt team
johnson was reportedly killed as he tried to <unk> the gun away from the hostage taker the australian <unk> <unk> reported citing unidentified sources
police haven't confirmed that account
he was an amazing person a <unk> person a person who always put other people before himself said peter <unk> johnson's former boss at the <unk> <unk> and <unk> in sydney where he worked for several years before the lindt cafe
<unk> told the daily telegraph that family was everything to him and not a single day would go by when he wouldn't talk about them
katrina dawson
one of our best and <unk>
<unk> death has shaken the legal community in sydney
katrina was one of our best and <unk> <unk> who will be greatly missed by her colleagues and friends at the <unk> bar said jane <unk> the president of the new south wales bar association

it takes <unk> ruit about five minutes to change someone's life
in that time the nepalese doctor can make a small <unk> in his patient's eye remove the <unk> <unk> <unk> her vision and replace it with an <unk> artificial <unk>
some of our younger <unk> even do it faster than that ruit told cnn
for many patients it's the first time they've seen in years if not decades
in the past thirty years ruit has personally restored the sight of more than one hundred thousand people across asia and africa and taught his rapid fire technique to countless other eye <unk> in parts of the world as isolated as north korea
his patients suffer from eye conditions that are mostly <unk>
but because of poverty and limited access to public health services they have been unable to seek treatment
their story is all too common in the developing world
an estimated thirty nine million people are blind worldwide according to the world health organization
of these around ninety percents live in low income areas and eighty percents suffer from conditions that can be prevented or <unk>
driven by a belief that the world's poorest people deserve safe affordable and high quality eye care just as much as anyone else ruit has made it his mission to <unk> <unk> <unk>
in one thousand nine hundred and ninety four he joined the late australian <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> who was his mentor and close friend in establishing <unk> an eye hospital in kathmandu dedicated to providing world class eye care to the people of nepal
the hospital <unk> state of the art <unk> that are <unk> used in treating <unk> or <unk> and exports them to more than thirty countries worldwide
for those who can not reach urban areas ruit and his team conduct mobile eye camps in remote parts of nepal and neighboring countries often <unk> for days and <unk> out structures like tents classrooms or even animal <unk> for use as temporary operating theaters
when the eye <unk> come off the day after an operation it's an incredibly moving moment for all involved
australian photographer michael amendolia has been capturing these <unk> scenes the <unk> of relief and tears of joy while traveling with ruit and his colleagues since the early one thousand nine hundred and ninety s
to mark the twenty th anniversary of <unk> amendolia has released some of his most striking images of ruit and his team at work in nepal and other countries in the region including <unk> china myanmar north korea and indonesia
amendolia who described ruit as a <unk> in some ways accompanied the nepalese surgeon on one of the first trips to north korea in two thousand and six
the communist state is notoriously closed off to westerners
international aid workers frequently struggle to reach those most in need in a country where two thirds of the population experiences chronic food shortages according to the united nations
but ruit who believes in leaving politics to world leaders had persuaded the north korean authorities to allow his team to conduct the two thousand and six surgery and training session in the south eastern city of <unk> after he had treated one of their diplomats stationed at the embassy in kathmandu
it was very <unk> said amendolia
we made the same path from the hotel in <unk> the same way every day to the hospital the same way exactly back and that's all we saw of <unk> for the seven or so days that we were there
amendolia describes how the north korean <unk> who came from across the country were so eager to learn that they <unk> close to ruit <unk> over the operating table to get a better look as he worked
i've never seen an eye operation where had so many <unk> around him he said
in the room where the recovering patients were examined portraits of then leader kim jong il and his predecessor kim il <unk> hung from the wall
one of the most moving images in <unk> collection is that of an eighty year old north korean man who sees his son for the first time in ten years after being completely blind in both eyes
of course the man who's had the operation is so relieved because he can see again but the whole family suddenly have a family member who can participate again in everything that happens as home amendolia said
patients who are blind in both eyes require constant care placing a burden on their families that can keep them trapped in a cycle of poverty
but this quick healing surgery allows them to <unk> their independence
the same <unk> moment is played out for long neglected patients in the mountains of nepal the islands of indonesia and rural china
ruit grew up in a small village in the himalayas so isolated that the <unk> school was a week's walk away
when he was seventeen his sister died of <unk> despite the disease being <unk>
the loss left ruit with a sense of urgency to pursue a path that benefited others not only himself
i am so grateful that i can make a difference in so many people's lives ruit said
at fifty nine that same sense of urgency that motivated him as a young man remains
when asked what it feels like to watch as a patient sees the world clearly the first time he responded
it really <unk> you and makes you move forward
but he cautioned that there remains so much he wants to do

<unk>
gone in the next ten years says <unk> eye surgery <unk>
let's start with a touch of perspective
it's not only russia where sexual minorities suffer discrimination
in the united states that <unk> of tolerance there's still a huge amount of <unk>
some u.s. states still refuse to recognize same sex marriage
and hate crimes and violence towards lgbt individuals remain a significant problem
russia does not have a <unk> on intolerance
however there is a key difference
in the u.s. officials go to great <unk> to <unk> <unk> views and behavior
laws have been passed and are <unk> protecting lgbt rights
hate crimes are <unk>
in russia that is rarely the case
that's not just my view it's the opinion of human rights watch a new york based rights group
in their latest report on russia titled <unk> to harm hrw finds the russian authorities have not only failed in their obligation to prevent and <unk> <unk> violence but have also effectively <unk> discrimination against lgbt people and cast them as second class citizens
the controversial measure the report <unk> out is of course russia's anti gay propaganda legislation
the law bans propaganda of non traditional sexual relations among <unk> and was according to hrw one of several anti lgbt measures adopted or proposed in two thousand and thirteen
in their report hrw says the law doesn't actually protect anyone but does give <unk> a reason to believe lgbt lives matter less to the russian government
the report goes on to document various horrific instances of violence and abuse against russia's lgbt community including by radical <unk> groups <unk> gay men on the <unk> of a fake date
it makes grim reading
during the soviet union homosexuality was a crime <unk> by prison and hard labor
homosexuals were regarded as <unk> or <unk> outside normal society
laws explicitly <unk> homosexuality were lifted in one thousand nine hundred and ninety three after the soviet collapse though there was no amnesty for those jailed for <unk> but the attitude appears to have stuck
even today lgbt activists in russia like the couple i met in st. petersburg recently are regarded as <unk> sometimes agents of the liberal west to be <unk>
the saint petersburg lawmaker behind the controversial propaganda law <unk> <unk> <unk> this when he told me that any russians who want a same sex marriage should move to the west where they belong
that's a <unk> connection in these times of growing tensions between russia and the west
linking russia's lgbt community with the enemy <unk> into old fears of corrupt <unk> <unk> russian <unk> and <unk> extremely badly for hopes that discrimination in russia will be <unk>

<unk> most popular video of two thousand and fourteen was
god is great the taliban militants shouted as they <unk> through the <unk> of a school in peshawar pakistan
then fourteen year old student ahmed <unk> recalled one of them took a harsher tone
a lot of the children are under the benches a pakistani taliban said according to ahmed
kill them
by the time the hours long siege at army public school and degree college ended early tuesday evening at least one hundred and forty five people one hundred and thirty two children ten school staff members and three soldiers were dead military spokesman gen. <unk> bajwa said
more than one hundred were injured many with gunshot wounds according to khyber pakhtunkhwa province information minister <unk> <unk>
the death toll does not include the terrorists who attacked the school <unk> into an auditorium where a large number of students were taking an <unk> and <unk> down many of them within minutes bajwa said
they started shooting <unk> bajwa said and that's where maximum damage was caused
pakistani taliban spokesman mohammed <unk> said the militants <unk> the school's walls around ten a.m. intent on killing older students there
the taliban had three hundred to four hundred people
under their custody at one point said <unk> whose group is called <unk> e taliban pakistan or <unk>
but bajwa said there was no hostage situation as the attackers focus was shooting to kill rather than taking captives
they were eventually met by pakistani troops who pushed through the complex building by building room by room
by four p.m. they'd confined the attackers to four buildings
a few hours later all the militants seven of them according to bajwa were dead
pakistani authorities spent tuesday night inside the school in peshawar a city about one hundred and twenty kilometers from the country's capital <unk> looking for survivors victims and <unk> explosive devices <unk> to <unk> the carnage
as they searched they discovered that the school's <unk> was among the terrorists victims
the attack drew sharp condemnation from top pakistani officials who vowed that the country wouldn't stop its war against the taliban
we are <unk>
we will not back off defense minister <unk> <unk> told cnn
but he said the ambush at the school is another example of how great his nation's sacrifices have been in fighting that's raged for more than a decade
even the children are dying on the <unk> in the war against terror he said
the smaller the coffin the heavier it is to carry
it's a very very tragic day
what do the pakistan taliban want
minister
most of the dead were twelve to sixteen years old
on a typical day the army public school and degree college is home to about one thousand one hundred students and staff most of them sons and daughters of army personnel from around peshawar though others attend as well
their nightmare began in late morning when a car exploded behind the school
pakistani education minister muhammad <unk> <unk> <unk> explained to cnn that the blast was a <unk> meant to <unk> the attention of the school's security guards
gunmen got over the walls and walked through where students in <unk> eight nine and ten have classes and fired randomly said dr. <unk> <unk> of <unk> lady reading hospital citing students
they came in with enough ammunition and other supplies to last for days and were not expecting to come out alive according to a pakistani military official
seventh <unk> mohammad <unk> said he was sitting outside his classroom taking a <unk> test when the gunfire erupted
he fell into <unk> before running to the school's gates to safety
ahmed the fourteen year old student remembered being in the school's auditorium when four or five people burst in through a back door and started rapidly firing
after getting shot in his left shoulder the ninth <unk> lay under a <unk>
my shoulder was <unk> out of the <unk> and somebody was following ahmed recalled
they went into another room i ran to the exit i fell
bajwa told reporters that pakistani security forces reached the school fifteen minutes after the attack began
they found he said the children
<unk> in blood with their bodies on top of each other
most of those killed were between the ages of twelve and sixteen said <unk> <unk> chief minister of khyber pakhtunkhwa province of which peshawar is the capital
but some adults in the school also were targets like a twenty eight year old office assistant who was shot and then burned alive police official <unk> <unk> said
pakistan has seen plenty of violence much of it involving militants based in provinces such as south waziristan north waziristan and the khyber agency all <unk> regions in northwest pakistan near peshawar along its border with afghanistan
it is the home base of the <unk> an organization that has sought to force its conservative version of islam in pakistan
the group has battled pakistani troops and on a number of <unk> attacked civilians as well
peshawar an ancient city of more than three million people <unk> right up against the khyber pass has often found itself in the center of it all
militants repeatedly targeted the city in response to pakistani military <unk> like a two thousand and nine truck bombing of a popular marketplace <unk> by women and children that killed more than one hundred people
and the taliban hasn't <unk> to go after schoolchildren
their most notable target is malala yousafzai who was singled out and shot on october nine two thousand and twelve as she <unk> to school in a van with other girls
the teenage girl survived and last week became the youngest <unk> of the nobel peace prize for her efforts to promote education and girls rights in pakistan and beyond
yousafzai was <unk> by this <unk> and cold <unk> act of terror in peshawar saying tuesday that innocent children in their school have no place in horror such as this
i call upon the international community leaders in pakistan all political parties everyone stand up together and fight against terrorism the sixteen year old added in another statement
and we should make sure that every child gets a safe and quality education
still even by pakistan and the <unk> gruesome standards tuesday's attack may be the most <unk> yet
this is the deadliest incident inside pakistan since october two thousand and seven when about one hundred and thirty nine <unk> died and more than two hundred and fifty others were wounded in an attack near a procession for exiled former pakistani prime minister <unk> <unk> according to the university of <unk> global terrorism database
even the taliban in afghanistan with which the <unk> is closely affiliated criticized the deliberate killing of innocent people women and children against islamic principles and expressed condolences to the <unk> victims according to spokesman <unk> <unk>
it comes after peace talks between the pakistan taliban and pakistan's government as recently as last spring
the government released nineteen taliban <unk> in a goodwill gesture in fact
but talks broke down under a wave of attacks by the taliban and <unk> political pressure to bring the violence under control
in september two thousand and thirteen <unk> members and children attending sunday school were among eighty one people killed in a suicide bombing at the <unk> all <unk> church of pakistan
a <unk> group of the pakistan taliban claimed responsibility blaming the u.s. program of drone strikes in tribal areas of the country
and for the past few months the pakistani military has been conducting a ground offensive to clear out militants <unk> violence that's displaced tens of thousands of people and sparked deadly <unk>
<unk> the pakistan taliban spokesman told cnn that the latest attack was revenge for the killing of hundreds of innocent <unk> during repeated army operations in provinces including south waziristan north waziristan and the khyber agency
the <unk> spokesman challenged that ordinary citizens were targeted saying that five army vehicles are <unk> stationed at the school
we are facing such heavy nights in routine <unk> said <unk> the siege shortly before it ended
today you must face the heavy night
the cafe siege in the heart of sydney ended early tuesday with the death of the gunman and two of his hostages but a great deal of unanswered questions remain
this has been an absolutely <unk> and ugly incident australian prime minister tony abbott said noting that sydney had been touched by terrorism for the first time in more than thirty five years
details have emerged about the two hostages who died amid the <unk> chaotic final moments and about the man who held them and others captive
but with police still investigating what happened during the sixteen long hours of the hostage taking here's a summary of what we know and don't know about key aspects of the story
what we know
authorities have identified the two hostages who were killed
katrina dawson thirty eight and tori johnson thirty four
a growing number of <unk> are being paid to dawson a lawyer and johnson the manager of the cafe
dawson a mother of three worked down the street from the cafe
johnson had been employed by lindt for more than two years
what we don't know
how exactly they died
<unk> reports in australia media suggest both dawson and johnson may have been killed trying to protect others
the australian <unk> <unk> reported that johnson was trying to <unk> the gun from the hostage taker
the <unk> mail reported that dawson was trying to defend a pregnant colleague
police have declined to comment on the reports saying what happened is still under investigation
what we know
the hostage taker has been named as man haron monis a fifty year old man who was born in iran and settled in australia
australian prime minister tony abbott described monis as a deeply <unk> individual a long history of crime a long history of mental instability and <unk> with extremism
he pleaded guilty last year to writing offensive letters to the families of australian troops
he was also facing charges of being an <unk> to murder as well as over forty five sexual and assault related offenses according to authorities
what we don't know
why he wasn't being more closely monitored
abbott <unk> up the questions on many people's minds tuesday when he asked at a news conference how can someone who has had such a long and <unk> history not be on the appropriate watch lists and how can someone like that be entirely at large in the community
he said australian authorities would be looking at those questions in the days and weeks ahead
what we know
during the siege abbott said the hostage taker sought to <unk> his actions with the <unk> of the death <unk> referring to the terrorist group that has seized control of large areas of iraq and syria
according to his website and social media posts monis <unk> himself as a muslim cleric <unk> extremist views
after he settled in australia monis became sympathetic to what he perceived
was the <unk> of muslims and islamists around the world his former lawyer <unk> <unk> told cnn
but his bigger cause according to <unk> was <unk> the australian government against sending troops to fight in wars on foreign soil like afghanistan where monis said innocent women and children were being killed
monis was intensely <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> said
what we don't know
what monis was trying to achieve by taking hostages in the cafe
the full picture is yet to emerge of what demands he made of authorities
australian media reported monday that he requested an isis flag and a phone call with abbott
<unk> said that when he represented monis last year he never ever spoke of physical violence of any kind
he suggested that something might have happened in the <unk> months that caused him to become <unk>
monis last tweet linked to his website with a message posted the day of his attack on the sydney cafe
if we stay silent towards the criminals we can not have a peaceful society
the more you fight with crime the more peaceful you are
what we know
after around sixteen hours of the <unk> standoff police moved in after hearing gunfire inside the cafe according new south wales police commissioner andrew <unk> <unk>
the <unk> mail reported that a technical support <unk> <unk> on the second floor of a building opposite the store made the call hostage down
window two that changed the course of events
police say they believe monis was acting alone
besides the two people who were killed four others were wounded by <unk> and two pregnant women were being <unk> for health and welfare police said
all of them were reported to be in stable condition
what we don't know
what exactly happened inside the cafe
while reports of what took place are emerging in the australian media authorities are staying tight <unk> as investigations continue
we're clearly speaking to those victims and we're clearly speaking to other witnesses
but this is going to take a bit of time to piece this together because a lot of those people are quite <unk> said new south wales deputy police commissioner catherine burn
what we know
australian leaders have applauded the reaction of their citizens pointing to the large numbers of flowers being laid at the scene of the siege in tribute to the victims
people have gone about their business and in the aftermath of the end of the siege last night people have responded with typical australian <unk> and generosity abbott said
muslim leaders in australia quickly condemned the hostage taking as a criminal act that has no place in islam
amid fears that australian muslims could become the targets of <unk> attacks twitter users offered to <unk> muslims wearing religious clothes on public transport as a gesture of solidarity
the social media campaign took off with the hashtag <unk> becoming the top trending hashtag globally in a few hours
meanwhile the new south wales police announced tuesday that it was launching a three week operation across sydney focused on high <unk> policing increased presence in public places and public transport hubs
what we don't know
what the future holds
the cafe siege has raised troubling questions about the possibility of more so called lone wolf attacks
the tragedy of these times is that there are people even in a society such as <unk> who wish to do us harm abbott said
we are not <unk> to the politically motivated violence which has for so long <unk> other countries
in recent months australia introduced some of the toughest anti terrorism laws in the world and raised the national terrorism alert level
but abbott said that authorities can only do so much to prevent attacks without prior warning and knowledge
even if this individual this sick and <unk> individual had been front and centre on our watch lists even if this individual had been monitored twenty four hours a day it's quite likely certainly possible that this incident could have taken place because the level of control that would be necessary to prevent people from going about their daily life would be very very high indeed the prime minister said
the scene in sydney
grenades and gunfire
a top united nations official on monday told the security council she has run out of words to describe the worsening situation in syria

a story about pope francis allegedly saying animals can go to heaven went viral late last week
the problem is that it wasn't true
many erroneous news reports on this incident relied on an article that appeared in the new york times
that article alleged that the pope at a general audience at the vatican <unk> a boy whose dog had died by saying
one day we will see our animals again in the <unk> of christ
paradise is open to all of god's creatures
this was not what happened and in a <unk> now <unk> to that <unk> article the times points out
the article also <unk> what francis is known to have said
according to vatican radio francis said
the holy <unk> teaches us that the <unk> of this wonderful design also affects everything around us which was interpreted to mean he believes animals go to heaven
so
wrong and wrong again
but even the <unk> at the times and elsewhere did little to stop the initial report of the story from <unk> around the internet and giving new <unk> hope to animal lovers everywhere
first while i know it's <unk> to write <unk> headlines like dogs in heaven
pope francis leaves <unk> gates open news organizations that ran the erroneous account really should hold fact checking to a higher standard
note to writers
don't rely on people for the ethical treatment of animals as a source for papal quotes
second part of the reason this story caught fire is that it sounds like something pope francis would say
in his two years as the leader of the worldwide roman catholic church francis has <unk> the <unk>
by <unk> he must love <unk> and <unk> right
as david <unk> of religion news service points out this isn't the first time such a <unk> about this pope has spread
last year news reports said he was <unk> out of the vatican at night to feed the homeless around rome
a nice thought but also not true
the media and the public are so <unk> for francis to say novel things and disregard <unk> customs that the story was too good to check out
it fit with the pattern <unk> <unk>
the animals can go to heaven <unk> also <unk> francis as a <unk> of <unk> controversy which brings me to my third point
people have strong feelings about whether they will spend the <unk> with their deceased beloved <unk>
this is where i should be honest and admit i'm not the world's biggest animal <unk>
a bite when i was a young child <unk> a <unk> fear of most dogs especially big ones
but i have loved some animals including my <unk> dog <unk> who died earlier this year
lots of friends tried to comfort her with the <unk> bridge story which says that animals wait in a heaven like place to be reunited with their owners in the <unk>
this is definitely not catholic teaching but its popularity reveals the desire of people to believe that their <unk> lives have meaning
while the <unk> of the catholic church which contains official church teaching does not address the issue directly it does make clear that animals do not have the same <unk> souls of humans and thus would not be eligible to enter the <unk> gates so to speak
the <unk> says we should not <unk> animals but points out that god made them for humans <unk> and that we should not spend money on them that should as a priority go to the relief of human <unk>
one can love animals
one should not direct to them the <unk> due only to persons
the quote that paradise is open to all of god's creatures which was <unk> attributed to the current pope is now being attributed by the times and others to a previous one paul <unk> who died in one thousand nine hundred and seventy eight although the <unk> here is also not particularly decisive
even if it were just because a pope says something doesn't mean church teaching has changed
my apologies to all the animal rights activists <unk> and everyone who has ever lost a pet who got so excited yesterday
while catholics believe that their leader is <unk> that <unk> is a lot more complicated than meaning that everything that comes out of the pope's mouth is the gospel truth
also it's important to note that paul <unk> alleged comments apparently were in response to a young boy whose dog had recently died
in the catholic church we call that being <unk>
in other words the pope was trying to comfort the boy and provide <unk> not <unk> <unk>
what is true is that francis has been <unk> about the importance of caring for creation
the source of this whole controversy was a late november talk about how the end times will result in a new creation
but neither he nor pope paul <unk> went so far as to <unk> <unk> souls to animals that would be <unk> to humans
but as this whole incident <unk> people will believe what they want to believe
two american soldiers and at least nineteen <unk> were killed in a spate of attacks in afghanistan friday and saturday some of which were claimed by the taliban officials said
the violence began friday when a bomb explosion hit a convoy of nato led international security assistance force troops
two american soldiers were killed in that blast a u.s. defense official said saturday on condition of anonymity

the civilians were <unk> devices <unk> by the taliban to target military tanks and vehicles in an area between <unk> and <unk> ali districts of southern <unk> he said

unknown gunmen in kabul killed <unk> <unk> head of the afghan supreme court <unk> saturday morning said <unk> <unk> spokesman for <unk> police chief
that afternoon a suicide bomber targeted a bus carrying afghan national army personnel in the <unk> area of kabul on saturday afternoon said <unk> <unk> a spokesman for the afghan interior ministry
six army personnel were killed and eighteen other people were injured including two women <unk> he said
the taliban spokesman <unk> claimed responsibility for the blast in an e mail
he said that from now on taliban attacks against foreign and afghan forces would be stepped up
in the past couple of months the taliban have targeted many afghan national army buses and other vehicles
two days ago a bus carrying army personnel to work was targeted by a suicide bomber
five <unk> were killed and twelve more were injured
after many attacks on army buses especially during the morning and evening rush hour <unk> kabul residents are worried
some have called on the afghan defense ministry to change the way it <unk> army personnel
<unk> who witnessed saturday's attack said
the defense ministry should stop using big buses to avoid being an easy target and its personnel should use different routes to <unk> to work
he said that this way the lives of both army personnel and civilians who are traveling on the same roads would be saved
the taliban issued a separate warning saturday via facebook to media critical of the group saying that from now on will not stay silent and tolerate their actions and by using every possible way attacks will be carried out against them so <unk> is <unk> from its root in our country
the continuing violence comes as afghan forces prepare to take on greater responsibility for ensuring the country's security as international forces transition to a supporting role
at the end of december u.s. forces will end their combat role in afghanistan and instead focus on counterterrorism missions and training <unk> and assisting afghan troops
nonetheless nearly eleven thousand u.s. troops will remain in afghanistan in the beginning of two thousand and fifteen
american forces will drop to five thousand five hundred in two thousand and sixteen and by two thousand and seventeen the coalition will <unk> to kabul
hagel
more u.s. troops than planned will remain in afghanistan next year

the <unk> story mentioned the <unk> law was submitted to the provincial <unk> for final approval before it could be implemented
in august another city in xinjiang banned people wearing islamic style clothing and large beards from riding public buses during a provincial sporting event according to state media
news reports at the time said <unk> city authorities targeted <unk> large beards as well as three types of islamic dresses including those with the star and <unk> symbol
dozens of bus stations in the city were said to be manned by security personnel to conduct checks and report <unk> to the police
while the measures in <unk> didn't openly single out uyghurs exiled uyghur rights groups have condemned them calling the ban a green light for racism and discrimination
those restrictions came a month after authorities in xinjiang banned students and civil <unk> from <unk> during ramadan the muslim holy month
amnesty international has said uyghurs face widespread discrimination in employment housing and educational opportunities as well as <unk> religious freedom and political <unk>

people in mosul the iraqi city now under control of the group calling itself the islamic state got these and other messages loud and clear after sunset prayers friday when armed men handed out a color printed pamphlet question and answers on female slaves and their freedom three residents told cnn
people started gathering in small groups <unk> about this said one of the men whom cnn didn't name for security reasons
most are shocked but can not do much about it
the document was first printed in october or november then later posted on an isis website
it has gotten more <unk> recently because of the middle east media research institute an independent washington based nonprofit whose <unk> board includes former national security agency director michael <unk> <unk> <unk> cia director james <unk> and ex u.s. defense secretary <unk> <unk>
the idea that isis is kidnapping selling and raping women and children is hardly surprising
