on the other side of the <unk> a new pope that named himself john <unk> would be <unk> an <unk> to <unk>
john <unk> was <unk> for calling the second vatican council in one thousand nine hundred and sixty two which <unk> in great changes in the roman catholic church's relationship with the modern world
he was <unk> to pick the name john at all says melloni since the last man to hold the name is <unk> as an <unk> because he was elected pontiff during a <unk> in the church in the fifteen th century

but since then only one <unk> <unk> in the sixteen th century has kept his <unk> name
some were <unk> from countries other than italy who wanted to <unk> a link through their names to the great <unk> of rome
this was the start of the long <unk> of <unk> named <unk> <unk> and benedict said melloni
in fact he added the <unk> can be seen as <unk> of a <unk> without sons and <unk> creating a sense of <unk> and a link to the <unk> names in the church

once all the <unk> are <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of cardinals will ask the <unk> elected head of the church on the <unk> if he <unk> the role and what he wants to be called
while we <unk> to hear we can be sure of only one <unk> according to melloni
the new pope won't be called peter
this is out of respect for the first st. peter the <unk> but <unk> also <unk> a <unk> old <unk> that a peter ii will be the very last pope to serve

isis is on its <unk> after the loss of kobani and an offensive by kurdish peshmerga armed fighters who protect <unk> kurdish region around mosul <unk> second largest city and a <unk> point for all sides in the conflict
but on friday the sunni extremist group launched an <unk> on <unk> oil rich city of kirkuk in what may be an attempt to <unk> kurdish troops from mosul
a report by <unk> a private website <unk> to <unk> news from a kurdish <unk> said at least thirty isis fighters were killed in the <unk> and fifteen captured

meanwhile gen. <unk> mansour the head of peshmerga forces in <unk> in <unk> province was killed in clashes with isis in <unk> kirkuk <unk> <unk> a senior kurdish figure and local peshmerga leader told cnn on saturday
mansour brought his troops from <unk> about one hundred miles away to <unk> the peshmerga in kirkuk following the isis <unk> he said
u.s. and coalition aircraft carried out seventeen airstrikes in iraq on friday according to a u.s. central command statement ten of them near kirkuk and two near mosul
both the coalition and the peshmerga are trying to prevent isis from opening a new front in kirkuk which isis likely hoped would <unk> the pressure on mosul
<unk> by going on the offensive here isis appears to be <unk> some <unk> targets for strikes
if isis can be <unk> back from positions in kirkuk it will have to try other <unk> <unk> to <unk> kurdish forces away from the <unk> of mosul
the <unk> on their own <unk> have no <unk> of <unk> mosul but want to <unk> off isis <unk> lines into the city
another ten airstrikes were carried out friday against isis targets in syria eight of them near kobani
according to the syrian <unk> for human rights a london based opposition group from october six to monday the fighting for kobani killed nine hundred and seventy nine isis <unk> three hundred and twenty four <unk> fighters and twelve rebels backing the <unk>
thirty eight more isis militants died in attacks using <unk> <unk> vehicles or bomb <unk> and the isis shelling of kobani killed twelve civilians <unk> said
on the other hand hundreds of militants died during u.s. and arab allies airstrikes on the city and its <unk> the group said
however the success of the coalition airstrikes in kobani will be hard to <unk> elsewhere
there are almost no civilians left in the city of kobani and most residents left early on when the fighting started especially in the <unk> areas close to the front line
this <unk> airstrikes were <unk> <unk> with the coalition able to target one side and avoid civilian <unk>
the front line was well <unk> so it was clear where the isis and kurdish fighters were
a more <unk> situation is when airstrikes seek to target isis inside <unk> areas like mosul in iraq <unk> in syria and other cities under isis control
here the <unk> of airstrikes is <unk> because of the risk of <unk> among civilians
when coalition airstrikes hit cities in <unk> in northern syria civilian deaths were reported last year
three of the prisoners isis apparently wants back are women a failed suicide <unk> an alleged bomb <unk> and a woman tied to the head of isis
the fourth is a child
many countries have a <unk> of not <unk> with terrorists
but this new <unk> by isis is putting <unk> to the test
in its most recent demand isis called for <unk> al rishawi to be <unk> over
she is a <unk> <unk> <unk> for her role in a two thousand and five suicide bombing at a <unk> <unk> in jordan that killed dozens

jordanian officials have said they are <unk> to <unk> al rishawi for the pilot
but they have demanded <unk> of life to <unk> that al <unk> captured in december after his fighter <unk> <unk> in syria is still alive
former fbi <unk> <unk> <unk> said jordan was <unk> right to do so and that the <unk> of isis so far to provide <unk> of life was <unk>
it's just a <unk> and <unk> course of <unk> in these <unk> of negotiations and they are <unk> not to do that at this point he said
the latest proposal by isis is not a <unk> exchange in the usual sense since the militants now want the release of al rishawi just in order not to kill the two hostages rather than <unk> their release
<unk> said <unk> into this kind of territory with terrorists was <unk>
if you <unk> in that <unk> of <unk> then they can <unk> to kill the same person over and over and over again and continue to demand release of hostages or whatever their <unk> are he said
you <unk> give in to that <unk> of <unk> because then it <unk> you in an <unk> <unk> where they have all the power
it's important to <unk> that for isis and groups like them the key <unk> is gain <unk> said
<unk> are in a <unk> exchange business
while it's a <unk> <unk> to us to them it's business and it's the business isis is in and so you have to <unk> it like that
<unk> failed suicide <unk> al rishawi isis wants two other women an alleged bomb <unk> and a woman tied to the head of isis and a child
each of the prisoners is <unk> and <unk> important for the terror group
al rishawi is connected to isis through her brother once a <unk> member of al qaeda in iraq which <unk> isis

the <unk> of <unk> <unk> can been seen as the direct <unk> of terrorist organizations and for that reason and a few others is <unk> as <unk> <unk> by the u.s. uk and <unk> other nations he said
there would be nothing unusual about the <unk> of <unk> and if the <unk> <unk> is <unk> in as part of the deal then that is a great <unk>
it's <unk> far from certain that <unk> and al <unk> will <unk> from the current negotiations alive
but whether they gain the release of al rishawi or not isis leaders have very <unk> <unk> one <unk>
