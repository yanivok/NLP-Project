Every one of us remembers exactly where we were and what we were doing on April 15, when we learned that over 90 Liverpool supporters had been crushed to death at an FA Cup semifinal. Along with many others across the country, I was listening to the game on the radio, quickly switching on the television to watch a disaster unfold in front of me.</p>\n<p>This was a time before the Premier League, before the massive investment in all-seater stadia; football was very different back then.</p>\n<p>Anyone who'd stood on a terrace and been herded like cattle into and out of a stadium could relate to what those fans must have gone through. Most of the time, standing behind the goal at a first division game was a lot of fun, the crowd ebbed and flowed with the action on the field, a crowd that was a vibrant, living entity and you were thrilled to be a part of it.<span></span></p>\n<p>Never did it occur to you that being swept off your feet to a point 30 feet down the terrace could be dangerous, nor that one day you might not be able to move at all, the life slowly crushed from your lungs while your favorite team played just yards ahead of you.</p>\n<p>Everything about Hillsborough was awful, but for the bereaved families and the traumatized fans, the pain would only get worse. Within minutes of the game being stopped, the senior police officer in charge had blamed Liverpool supporters for forcing open a perimeter gate.</p>\n<p>His comment took seconds to utter, but it helped shape the narrative for decades to come, namely that those supporters were responsible for their own fatalities and for the deaths of others.</p>\n<p>Only in 2012, 23 years after the fact, was the accepted narrative meaningfully open to question. An independent panel cleared the supporters of responsibility and new evidence suggested that some of the victims might have survived if there had been a better – and more coordinated – response from the emergency services.</p>\n<p>Tireless campaigning from the families was starting to pay off, 96 verdicts of accidental death were quashed, a new inquest – which began last month – was ordered.</p>\n<blockquote><p>PHOTO: Scarves are laid at the Hillsborough memorial at Anfield <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://t.co/Z8L1qdJw6o\">http://t.co/Z8L1qdJw6o</a>— <br>Liverpool FC (@LFC) <a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/LFC/status/455306222137126912\">April 13, 2014</a></p></blockquote>\n<p>Now, the role of a number of interested parties will be considered by the Inquest – notably South Yorkshire police, who were on duty on the day of the disaster; the West Midlands police, who were responsible for the official investigation that followed the disaster; the Yorkshire ambulance service, and the Football Association.</p>\n<p>It has taken a generation for the families to at last feel that all the evidence will be put to the test. In that time, an entire community in the northwest of England had been traumatized, but crucially it had never given up. Against all the odds, they at last have a chance of finding out what happened all those years ago.</p>\n<p>It was almost as if Liverpool's adopted song, &quot;You'll Never Walk Alone,&quot; had provided the template for their struggle:</p>\n<p><em>&quot;When you walk through a storm, keep your chin up high.</em></p>\n<p><em>At the end of the storm is a golden sky.</em></p>\n<p><em>Walk on with hope in your heart and you'll never walk alone.&quot;</em></p>\n<p>But the Hillsborough campaigners never wanted to be in that storm. Working-class families never wanted to have to find the strength to stand up to the highest authorities in the land, but that was the card they were dealt. They don't want any awards or accolades but they will not give up until they are satisfied that there has been a fair and rigorous hearing.</p>\n<p>Liverpool is a port city. Some would say it has more in common with New York or Marseille than the rest of Britain, its people are hard-working and honest and they don't take kindly to being pushed around. It's sometimes debated whether any other community would have kept fighting for as long as the &quot;Scousers,&quot; whose campaign has been tenacious in the extreme.</p>\n<blockquote><p>PHOTO: Anfield holds a minute's silence in memory of the 96 <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://t.co/doB5E5697q\">http://t.co/doB5E5697q</a>— <br>Liverpool FC (@LFC) <a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/LFC/status/455327368052101120\">April 13, 2014</a></p></blockquote>\n<p>As Bill Kenwright, the owner of the city's other big team – Everton – once put it, &quot;They picked on the wrong city. They picked on the wrong Mums.&quot;</p>\n<p>Just ask Rupert Murdoch, who watched the sales of his &quot;The Sun&quot; newspaper plummet after leading with a cover story titled &quot;The Truth&quot; about Liverpool's fans robbing the Hillsborough victims and urinating on the police.<br>\nIt was estimated in Phil Scraton’s book <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Hillsborough-Truth-Professor-Phil-Scraton/dp/1845964950\">“Hillsborough, the Truth”</a> that the headline cost the publisher 200,000 readers and over $16 million in annual revenue.</p>\n<p>The bereavement was so cruel. The families have had to relive the horror of 1989 so many times that there's hardly been a chance to grieve. Countless family members have died prematurely, there have been breakdowns and suicides. No-one outside of those families can say for sure if Hillsborough is the cause, but their pain is very obvious.</p>\n<p>I spent only a short time with the victims’ relatives, but it was long enough to see the inner torment that is still very raw and very real. I saw the Polaroid photographs of their loved ones in body bags, I held the tickets that granted them access through the turnstiles and down towards their deaths.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The mosaic tribute to the 96 on The Kop today <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://t.co/lD2w3bicdg\">http://t.co/lD2w3bicdg</a>— <br>Liverpool FC (@LFC) <a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/LFC/status/455293498548559872\">April 13, 2014</a></p></blockquote>\n<p>In some cases, the impact of Hillsborough is obvious. Trevor and Jenni Hicks, who drove to the game as a family and returned home without their two daughters, were divorced within two years. The grief and the pressure of coping with it drove them apart.</p>\n<p>In so many other cases though, the devastating impact is less apparent. Margaret Aspinall, who lost her eldest son James, admitted to me that she hardly saw her other four children because she was so consumed by the years of struggle following the disaster. Now, the next generation makes the same complaint, they never get to spend time with Grandma.</p>\n<p>These are just two stories of the bereaved families. There are at least 90 more and that's before even considering the hundreds of people who were injured and the countless others who went to a football game and were emotionally traumatized by a sight of bodies piled against a perimeter fence.</p>\n<p>So many people have been damaged by Hillsborough, so many families irrevocably broken.</p>\n<p>All of these people are tired. Many, who should by now be enjoying a peaceful retirement, are still waiting for the facts to be established.</p>\n<p>There must never be another Hillsborough. In recent times, the debate around the reintroduction of standing at football matches has re-surfaced – &quot;safe standing&quot; is proving popular at some grounds in Germany.</p>\n<p>Some would like to see it introduced to Premier League grounds in England, but those making the arguments haven't had to walk even a mile in the shoes of the Hillsborough survivors. They would never endorse it because safe seating will always be safer than safe standing.</p>\n<p>I must say it's hard to disagree with them.</p><br> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/cnniworldsport.wordpress.com/10299/\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/cnniworldsport.wordpress.com/10299/\" border=\"0\"></a> <img height=\"1\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=worldsport.blogs.cnn.com&amp;blog=8188608&amp;post=10299&amp;subd=cnniworldsport&amp;ref=&amp;feed=1\" border=\"0\"><img height=\"1\" width=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/rss/edition_worldsportblog/~4/CZnvMS4jvOg\">","direction":"ltr"},"title":"Will Hillsborough scars ever heal?","summary":{"content":"For British football fans in the spring of 1989, it was our JFK moment.

It’s a banner paying tribute to the former Manchester United manager and the ridiculous number of trophies he helped bring to the club - most notably 13 English Premier League titles and two European Champions League triumphs. </p>\n<p>But seeing that banner while watching the post-Ferguson United take on the might of European champions Bayern Munich in a Champions League quarterfinal first leg – it made me chuckle.<span></span> </p>\n<p>If there there was an impossible dream, it was this. </p>\n<p>United were trying to beat the best team in Europe - not to mention reigning world and German champions - who have also just retained the Bundesliga in record time and happen to have stepped up three gears since the arrival of Pep Guardiola last year. </p>\n<p>And that’s even before you consider that United came into the match seventh in the Premier League table, led by an under-fire manager, short of confidence and without star striker Robin van Persie.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://rss.cnn.com/2014/04/05/sport/football/bayern-munich-bundesliga-football/\">Read: &quot;Man Utd clash is life or death&quot; </a> </p>\n<p>But David Moyes’ side put up a fight more like the United of old. Wayne Rooney, Danny Welbeck and co. battled to a 1-1 draw, with a resurgent Nemanja Vidic getting on the scoresheet and showing signs of returning to his imperious best. </p>\n<p>Certainly not the worst result to take into Wednesday's second leg at Bayern's Allianz Arena. And into the darkest corners of my mind, popped that thought that just maybe United could pull off something special.</p>\n<p>And then came the weekend. </p>\n<p>Guardiola’s Bayern were beaten for the first time in 54 league games - suffering a 1-0 defeat to eighth-place Augsburg - leaving them without a win in their last three games. </p>\n<p>Admittedly Guardiola rested a host of his biggest stars with an eye on Wednesday’s clash - describing the second leg as a final.</p>\n<p>On Saturday United stormed to <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2014/04/05/sport/football/chelsea-manchester-city-football/\">an impressive 4-0 win against Newcastle </a>– Moyes also having to do without a number of big names.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://rss.cnn.com/2014/04/06/sport/football/liverpool-west-ham-premier-league-football/\">Read: Liverpool back on top after controversial win </a></p>\n<p>It was another win on the road that makes them the Premier League’s most successful team away from home this season. That’s now three games unbeaten for United.</p>\n<p>“There is a big expectation at Old Trafford,” said Moyes by way of explanation. &quot;Whereas away from home, maybe there isn’t that same expectancy.”</p>\n<p>There certainly won’t be any expectation as United head to the Munich. But where many fans had given up hope last week... now there might just be a glimmer. </p>\n<p>I haven’t lost my marbles – I know that big-money signing Marouane Fellaini isn’t anywhere near a Champions League player. There’s no hiding the fact that veteran defender Rio Ferdinand is being held together by sticky tape and a whole pharmacy counter. And you can’t even compare Moyes’ CV (zero major honors) with Guardiola’s (11 major honors - nine with Barcelona and two already with Bayern.) </p>\n<p>But if the spirit of the last couple of games is anything to go by, United's players seem to have steeled themselves after much criticism. Moyes has even started striding down the touchline with something that resembles purpose. </p>\n<p>And - as we keep being reminded - no team has ever successfully defended the Champions League crown. </p>\n<p>In the 30 years that I’ve been following United, and going to games with my Dad, our mantra has always been “keep the faith”. Why change the habit of a lifetime now. </p><br> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/cnniworldsport.wordpress.com/10293/\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/cnniworldsport.wordpress.com/10293/\" border=\"0\"></a> <img height=\"1\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=worldsport.blogs.cnn.com&amp;blog=8188608&amp;post=10293&amp;subd=cnniworldsport&amp;ref=&amp;feed=1\" border=\"0\"><img height=\"1\" width=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/rss/edition_worldsportblog/~4/wqf-KY3X5Ho\">","direction":"ltr"},"title":"Can Man Utd dare to dream ahead of Bayern Munich tie?","summary":{"content":"Sitting in block 225 of the South Stand at Old Trafford last Tuesday, just to the right of the bench and beneath the press box, my eyes were drawn to the banner that proudly hangs on the Sir Alex Ferguson Stand.

It’s certainly the right decision. By all means say, “Congratulations and welcome to the 21st century” but the announcement seems to be motivated by self-interest more than a sudden enlightenment of the men who run the club.</p>\n<p>The Royal and Ancient Golf Club has traditionally been the guardian of the rules of the game since 1754, but in 2004 it devolved responsibility for the game’s administration and Britain’s Open championship to the newly-formed The R&amp;A.</p>\n<p>I was reporting from last year’s Open at Muirfield in Scotland, another club with a male only membership, and the issue of excluding women was a prominent one in the days leading up to the tournament.</p>\n<p>When I asked R&amp;A chief executive Peter Dawson what’s the difference between “all male” and “all white” he became rather agitated believing my comparison to be unfair and slightly preposterous. For many people outside golf, it wasn’t.</p>\n<p>Yes, single sex clubs are not illegal in the UK but, in mainstream western society, it feels as if they have become a marginal curiosity; things that are pointed and giggled at from afar, the way a young smartphone user would smirk at a typewriter.</p>\n<p>More crucially, holding one of golf’s four annual major championships at a men-only club jars badly for a sport that is now back in the Olympics. And as the International Olympic Committee discovered at Sochi’s Winter Games, there are plenty of politicians, athletes and fans who care about its charter of anti-discrimination and inclusion.</p>\n<p>So if in future there are women members at St Andrews the R&amp;A could say, “don’t blame us, we are not men only any more.” Then, the focus will shift to sponsors and the players who enjoy courses like Muirfield but were strangely quiet on the subject last July.</p>\n<p>The R&amp;A’s tactic mirrors what happened at the Masters where organisers of golf’s opening major each year finally stopped questions about Augusta National’s male only membership by admitting women - two of them.</p>\n<p>A token gesture, maybe, but they realised that when you stage one of the world’s biggest sporting events the massive scrutiny makes it tough to live in the past.

In the space of just a year, the landscape of professional sports here has been transformed with the emergence of three openly gay athletes.</p>\n<p>Robbie Rogers, who now plays for the LA Galaxy in Major League Soccer, broke the mould, before Jason Collins became the first openly gay player in any of the four major U.S. sports.</p>\n<p>The 35-year-old Collins was only signed on a 10 day contract by the Brooklyn Nets (subsequently signing for another 10 days) but the impact was huge.</p>\n<p>So think what it will be like if Michael Sam joins the NFL. Sam is a defensive end and has just completed his education at the University of Missouri –if he’s drafted in May, he’d become the first active NFL player to have declared his homosexuality publicly. </p>\n<p>In the macho world of testosterone-fuelled locker-rooms, homosexuality is seen as the last taboo.</p>\n<p><span></span></p>\n<p>As Rogers recently told CNN, “I’m in a love/hate relationship with football. I love it because I’ve done it my whole life and it’s brought me so much joy and I could, when I was on the field, you forget about it. You’re judged for what you do on the field, </p>\n<p>&quot;But there’s everything around football and politics. There’s the locker room that, when I was younger, before I came out, really hurt me. Stadiums where, especially in England, you hear the most homophobic things.”</p>\n<p>At the age of just 25, Rogers felt that he had to retire in order to live a more honest life as a gay man. It was only the positive reaction from his peers, particularly in his native America, that prompted him to play on with The Galaxy. </p>\n<p>The handful of prominent athletes who’ve come out recently have waited until their professional careers were over, notably the NBA’s John Amaechi, soccer’s Thomas Hizlsperger and rugby’s Gareth Thomas.</p>\n<p>In cricket, Steven Davies was a rare exception, he came out in 2011 and continued playing. He told me then that the reaction from his peers had been very positive.</p>\n<div><a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/video/data/2.0/video/sports/2014/01/08/sports-special-gay-robbie-rogers-football.cnn.html\">Click to watch video</a></div>\n<p>It remains to be seen how Sam will fare in the next few months. NFL teams don’t have a reputation for eagerly embracing &quot;distractions&quot; and as Sam learned at the NFL Combine - where players are scouted –the media circus was only really interested in one thing: his homosexuality. </p>\n<p>However, Sam's agent Cameron Weiss is optimistic, telling me that the NFL has been &quot;amazing&quot; and that from the interaction they’ve had with the teams so far, his client’s sexual orientation is a<br>\n&quot;non-issue.&quot; </p>\n<p>Despite football’s uber-macho image in the U.S., Weiss actually thinks that an NFL locker-room could be the most welcoming to an athlete like Sam.</p>\n<p>&quot;A football locker-room is the biggest in pro-sports, you’ve got 53 guys and the most diverse offering of personal backgrounds,&quot; said Sam's agent. &quot;I would think such an environment would be well-suited to be accepting of a player with a different sexual orientation.”</p>\n<p>Weiss admits that he was surprised by the positive reaction to Sam’s announcement.</p>\n<p>While they were expecting it to be mixed, they were instead &quot;overwhelmed&quot; by the support. “It’s a seminal time in the U.S., the issue of gay marriage is front and center and in 2014, it’s time for everyone to put these pre-conceived notions - that have held us back as a society - behind us.”</p>\n<p>Anthony Caruso is a sports attorney with special expertise in American football and he agrees the landscape is changing.</p>\n<div><a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/video/data/2.0/video/bestoftv/2014/02/24/exp-michael-sam-challenging-locker-room-culture.cnn.html\">Click to watch video</a></div>\n<p>He cautions that any player whose &quot;public profile is bigger than his statistics&quot; can be a problem, but he thinks the novelty of Sam or any other openly gay player will quickly wear off.</p>\n<p>“The lines between sports and entertainment are blurring very quickly,” said Caruso. &quot;The courage shown by Rogers, Collins and Sam will enable others to take the same brave steps. That’s important, it’s a good thing for sport.”</p>\n<p>As Neil Armstrong so eloquently put it on the lunar surface 45 years ago, the emergence of three openly gay athletes is only &quot;one small step,&quot; but it's a milestone that will perhaps give others the courage to live their lives more freely without having to sacrifice their sporting aspirations.</p>\n<p>But make no mistake that there is still a very long way to go. Assuming Sam makes it to the NFL he’ll be the only openly gay footballer player out of almost 1700. And don't forget in 33 of the states in the U.S., gay marriage is still illegal. </p>\n<p>But credit where credit is due. Not everyone would argue that the US is the most tolerant of societies in the western world, but in the sports world at least, it is tentatively taking small steps and leading by example.</p><br> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/cnniworldsport.wordpress.com/10269/\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/cnniworldsport.wordpress.com/10269/\" border=\"0\"></a> <img height=\"1\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=worldsport.blogs.cnn.com&amp;blog=8188608&amp;post=10269&amp;subd=cnniworldsport&amp;ref=&amp;feed=1\" border=\"0\"><img height=\"1\" width=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/rss/edition_worldsportblog/~4/-VO6FGR9eKk\">","direction":"ltr"},"summary":{"content":"These are seminal times in the United States.

I’m surprised; I didn't see that level of performance coming. I take responsibility, we have to play better. The players are hurting.&quot;</p>\n<p>Even an experienced pathologist might struggle to know where to start in carrying out the autopsy of this shambolic defeat. </p>\n<p>Of greatest concern for Moyes was that in the “desire stakes” his players were found pitifully wanting. </p>\n<p>Out of the FA Cup and the League Cup and trailing English Premier League leaders Chelsea by 15 points with 11 games left to play, the Champions League represented United’s only chance of silverware this season. </p>\n<p>After a season of mediocre performances, surely the players would grab this opportunity with both hands? But in the Georgios Karaiskakis Stadium on Tuesday there was only one side that appeared ready to give everything for 90 minutes - and it wasn’t United.</p>\n<p>Just as worrying for United was that key players such as Wayne Rooney – recently rewarded with a new contract worth a reported £300,000 ($500,000) a week – and Robin van Persie were so off key.</p>\n<p>And this against a side that, when the draw for the knockout stages of the tournament was made in December, was widely viewed as no obstacle to United’s passage into the quarterfinals.</p>\n<p>Olympiakos aren’t one of Europe’s strongest teams, and you can easily see United scoring three goals in the second leg at Old Trafford. The problem is that you can just as easily envisage the Greek team scoring against United’s ramshackle defense on March 19.</p>\n<p>This was a defeat that raised further questions about the logic behind Moyes’ appointment as Alex Ferguson’s successor. Don't forget the former Everton manager has never won a major trophy as a manager and has limited experience of European football.</p>\n<p>Some of Moyes’ picks for this game were mystifying.</p>\n<p>United’ s next match is against struggling West Brom in the English Premier League on March 8, but inexplicably Moyes decided to leave Adnan Januzaj, one of the few players who has shown form and consistency this season, behind in Manchester.</p>\n<p>Marouane Fellaini, who impressed in United’s win over Crystal Palace at the weekend in his first outing since December 4, was left on the bench by Moyes for the Athens game.</p>\n<p>It’s not the first time that Moyes’ tactical philosophy has been questioned - notably after the team delivered 81 crosses in the 2-2 league draw with Fulham, with only 18 finding a teammate.</p>\n<p>“If Moyes didn't see #mufc performance coming, it could be because he does not possess the vision,” <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GARSIDEK\">tweeted Kevin Garside of British paper the Independent.</a></p>\n<div><a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/video/data/2.0/video/sports/2014/01/15/spc-human-to-hero-gerard-pique-barcelona.cnn.html\">Click to watch video</a></div>\n<p>Van Persie did little to allay the impression that there is tactical drift at United when he told Dutch TV channel NOS: &quot;Our fellow players are sometimes occupying the spaces I want to play in. </p>\n<p>&quot;And when I see that it makes it difficult for me to come to those spaces as well. So that forces me to adjust my runs, based on the position of my fellow players. And unfortunately, they're often playing in my zones. I think that's a shame.&quot;</p>\n<p>Ferguson was given plenty of time to reshape United in his own image, but the alarming sense of deterioration at United this season under Moyes – this was the club’s 11th defeat – has raised questions from supporters whether the club’s current custodian should be entrusted with a reported $166 million transfer war chest in the summer.</p>\n<p>Captain Nemanja Vidic has already said he is leaving at the end of this season, while the playing futures of Rio Ferdinand, Patrice Evra, Ryan Giggs, Anderson – currently on loan at Fiorentina - Chris Smalling, Tom Cleverley, Javier Hernandez, Ashley Young and Carrick look uncertain.</p>\n<p>So expect plenty of comings and goings at Old Trafford before the end of August.</p>\n<p>The key question is whether United’s American owners – the Glazers – will remain patient with a manager who has looked less than comfortable in trying to get to grips with the not inconsiderable task of succeeding Ferguson.</p><br> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/cnniworldsport.wordpress.com/10246/\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/cnniworldsport.wordpress.com/10246/\" border=\"0\"></a> <img height=\"1\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=worldsport.blogs.cnn.com&amp;blog=8188608&amp;post=10246&amp;subd=cnniworldsport&amp;ref=&amp;feed=1\" border=\"0\"><img height=\"1\" width=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/rss/edition_worldsportblog/~4/EAhLeSF_hpo\">","direction":"ltr"},"enclosure":[{"href":"http://i1.wp.com/i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/140226125705-moyes-athens-tease-story-top.jpg?resize=120%2C68","length":28800,"type":"image/jpeg"}],"author":"jsinnottcnn","canonical":[{"href":"http://worldsport.blogs.cnn.com/2014/02/26/is-manchester-united-in-meltdown/","type":"text/html"}],"origin":{"htmlUrl":"http://worldsport.blogs.cnn.com","title":"CNN World Sport","streamId":"feed/http://rss.cnn.com/rss/edition_worldsportblog.rss"},"summary":{"content":"The jokes came thick and fast on Twitter after Manchester United’s 2-0 first leg Champions League defeat by Olympiakos in Athens: “The greatest Hellenic triumph since George Michael’s Careless Whisper.” Former footballers were equally unforgiving: &quot;MUFC have had the odd bad day over the years, but I cannot recall such an abject, hopeless, forlorn performance,” […]<img height=\"1\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=worldsport.blogs.cnn.com&amp;blog=8188608&amp;post=10246&amp;subd=cnniworldsport&amp;ref=&amp;feed=1\" border=\"0\">","direction":"ltr"},"published":1393420138000,"crawled":1393420433226,"alternate":[{"href":"http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_worldsportblog/~3/EAhLeSF_hpo/","type":"text/html"}],"updated":1393420138000,"title":"Is Manchester United in meltdown?","visual":{"url":"none"},"unread":true,"engagement":575},{"fingerprint":"8606f25b","keywords":["Olympics","Ben Wyatt","CNN Sport Features Executive Editor","Sochi","Winter Games"],"id":"sh0QEshPZ5O6oYQJdLBgzxr2EU4lzrrJXCTV7z00q8A=_1444a15647d:4ed7ee:5af01630","originId":"http://worldsport.blogs.cnn.com/?p=10230","content":{"content":"<p>Arguably only three events at the Winter Games could be deemed low risk to athletes' health.

Other global sport competitions just can't match the feast of fear-conquering on show here.</p>\n<p>In the Summer Games, the 100 meters is undoubtedly a tough competition to take part in, but the injury threat it carries can't be too dissimilar from a walk in the park.<br>\n<span></span></p>\n<p>Playing football at the World Cup carries the peril of dehydration (in hot locations for parts of Brazil) and, if you're very unlucky, the odd broken limb, but essentially the average Joe could give both of these activities a go without having to consult their insurance broker.</p>\n<p>Not so in Sochi.</p>\n<p>Take the skeleton for example. The plucky competitors in this discipline plunge head-first down a large ice pipe on little more than a tea tray at speeds close to 140 kph. It's not for the faint hearted, or really for the sane of mind if we're being honest.</p>\n<p>Neither is the luge, the foot-first version. Who can forget the tragic circumstances in the first few days of the Vancouver Games, when 21-year-old Georgian luge athlete Nodar Kumaritashvili lost his life after losing control in a practice run.</p>\n<p>In figure skating there's been a catalogue of injuries sustained from awkward falls and the mistimed swing of an skating blade. Outbreaks of violence are also common in ice hockey.</p>\n<iframe height=\"710\" width=\"612\" src=\"http://instagram.com/p/kjNVuxSMEo/embed/\"></iframe>\n<p>The ski jump is the closest an Olympic sport gets to sky diving without a parachute, while speed skating is a full-throttle slide into the barriers waiting to happen.</p>\n<p>There there is alpine skiing, which entails screaming down the face of a snow-covered, rocky mountain as fast as friction will allow and without care for the injury that beckons form a high-speed mistake.</p>\n<p>And these are just the traditional events. The new wave introduced to include sports more popular with the young are potentially even more threatening.</p>\n<p>Canadian champion freestyle skier Sarah Burke died after injuries sustained on a halfpipe in Utah, competing in the same event which is now offering medals here in the mountains above Adler.</p>\n<p>Slopestyle, whether on snowboard or skis, is extremely exciting offering the gymnastics of trampolining without the spring-mounted canvas for a landing. The adrenaline-fueled &quot;cross&quot; events are firm crowd favorites too.</p>\n<p>Every snowboard cross race I witnessed in the build up to the finals involved wipeouts, sometimes involving multiple athletes. It's not surprising really given you have four riders, going hell-for-leather, sometimes just inches away from one another on an alpine assault course of jumps, bumps and banked curves.</p>\n<p>Australian Cameron Bolton fractured a bone in his arm in the semifinals from a fall, but got back on his board to fly down the track one more time in the final.</p>\n<p>He wiped out again and was in significantly worse shape at the bottom than he was on the race before. Blood dripped from his nose.</p>\n<p>And let's remember there are still concerns over the extent of Russian cross skier Maria Komissarova's spinal injury which occurred during training at the Rosa Khutor Extreme Park.</p>\n<p>Given I'm now in my mid-30s and take every completed game of football I play through as a minor triumph against my body's lifetime collection of niggles, small sprains and injuries, I can't help but wince and worry for these athletes.</p>\n<p>Like motorsport, the great allure for the spectator is the courage these athletes display in the face of such danger.</p>\n<p>Their disciplines remain a bastion for those who put their bodies on the line, they are sports for those with a screw loose and they are rewarded for their madness with medals.</p>\n<p>Remember such courage next time you watch from the safety of your armchair.

It was ten seasons ago and Ronaldinho and co. had rolled into town for the commemorative opening match at City’s new home, The City of Manchester Stadium.</p>\n<p>Goater, the Bermudan striker, had left City for Reading at the end of the previous season after scoring 103 goals in 212 appearances during five years at the club. He’d arrived on a £400,000 transfer from Bristol City and achieved lifelong cult status with City fans for his never-say-die, bundle-it-in, keep-on-fighting attitude through the yoyo years.</p>\n<p>The fans’ anthem, to the tune of the Welsh hymn Bread of Heaven, summed up everything about City in the managerial years of Joe Royle and Kevin Keegan: a bit daft but endearing and full of passion and ironic self-belief: &quot;Feed the goat, feed the goat, feed the goat and he will score.&quot;<span></span></p>\n<p>My favorite Goater moment happened on the last derby day against Manchester United at Maine Road in 2002. He somehow managed to rob self-proclaimed City hater Gary Neville near the corner flag, cut inside and squeeze the ball past United’s keeper Fabien Barthez from a seemingly impossible angle. He got another and City beat United 3-1. Eternal hero status secured.</p>\n<p>Inevitably, United went on to become champions and City just avoided the drop.</p>\n<p>The following August, Goater was back for the official stadium opening and signing autographs near the tunnel as Barcelona’s superstars strolled out into the former Commonwealth Games stadium in drizzly, ramshackle east Manchester. The warm applause they got from the City fans somehow emphasized the gulf between the clubs.</p>\n<p>They were and are the glamor side of Spain who win titles and European trophies for fun, attracting the best players from Europe and South America and playing a swaggering style of football that makes true fans everywhere want to wear that famous red and blue shirt.</p>\n<p>Even better, World Player of the Year Ronaldinho was in his pomp and had the nerve to have just turned down Manchester United to join Barcelona from Paris St Germain. Such a snub was always going to make him a City favorite at the new stadium. Nobody could quite believe the Brazilian was here and playing against the Blues, even if it was just a pre-season leg-stretcher.</p>\n<p>By the next time I bumped into Goater, City’s world had been turned upside down.</p>\n<div><a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/video/data/2.0/video/international/2013/08/09/spc-talk-asia-vincent-kompany-a.cnn.html\">Click to watch video</a></div>\n<p>It was at Wembley Stadium at the FA Cup final of 2011. By then, the 'Goat' had quit playing and had become a City ambassador. There he was in his official club blazer, being mobbed by fans in the concourse as he made his way to the VIP area before City’s first major cup final for 35 years.</p>\n<p>The man who’d made him an ambassador was Mansour bin Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, commonly known as Sheikh Mansour, the deputy prime minister of the United Arab Emirates, minister of presidential affairs and member of the ruling family of Abu Dhabi. The man who reinvented Manchester City.</p>\n<p>Every City fan remembers where they were when they found out the man who held Abu Dhabi’s straining purse strings had bought the club from the always controversial Thaksin Shinawatra in September 2008.</p>\n<p>I was on the way back from the canteen at Sky TV in west London when Keith, the Sky Sports News news editor, stopped me and said, &quot;Have you heard? That sheikh has just done the deal and bought City.&quot; No doubt thousands of City fans had the same response as me: &quot;Right. Is he for real or is going to have a laugh and move on?&quot; Keith replied: &quot;He’s for real. This is going to be amazing.&quot; As usual, he was right.</p>\n<p>The sale was completed on transfer deadline day. By midnight, City fans were celebrating the scarcely credible news that manager Mark Hughes had signed Brazilian wonderkid Robinho from Real Madrid for £33 million. Nobody could believe it. Neither could anyone else. Even Robinho seemed to think he’d signed for United when he mixed up the teams at a news conference.</p>\n<p>But there he was, standing next to Hughes at City’s London office beaming away with a sky blue number 10 shirt. He even scored in it, 13 minutes into his debut, a free kick in a home defeat to Chelsea. As it turned out, even though the club was under unimaginably wealthy new ownership, Robinho was classic old school City - brilliant, lazy and prone to disappearing both on and off the pitch. The day in January 2010 when he came on as a sub against Everton after nine minutes only to be subbed himself after an hour summed him up.</p>\n<p>But his high-profile signing marked the beginning of the 'New City'. A moneyed City that could attract top-class players, expect to beat the top four Premier League teams and maybe, just maybe, qualify for the Champions League to play teams like Barcelona for real. Or even Real.</p>\n<p>It took a while. There was the 'City-itis' end to the 2010 season when Tottenham Hotspur claimed England’s last Champions League place by a whisker. City’s wait went on.</p>\n<div><a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/video/data/2.0/video/sports/2014/01/15/spc-human-to-hero-gerard-pique-barcelona.cnn.html\">Click to watch video</a></div>\n<p>But the 2011 FA Cup Final against Stoke City was an important milestone.</p>\n<p>Not only had City beaten United and seen that perennial pain in the neck Paul Scholes sent off in the Wembley semi, they also had - in Yaya Toure - a world-class player who’d left Barcelona for Manchester. His goal fifteen minutes from the end changed everything. Unbelievably, there was Carlos Tevez, a former United title-winner, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oEZhuU0wYA\">lifting the trophy</a> that marked the start of a new era of silverware for City.</p>\n<p>After that, the joke was over.</p>\n<p>City had elbowed their way into Europe’s elite.</p>\n<p>There they were lining up against Bayern Munich, Villarreal and Napoli in their first Uefa Champions League group. And there I was ambling around the ruins of Pompeii before watching Vincent Kompany lead out City ahead of that <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Drc8YSu0W-Q\">famous Champions League anthem</a> in chaotic, charismatic Naples.</p>\n<p><span>A season later they were back again, this time as English Premier League champions, the ghost of City’s fiascos of the past finally vanquished by Sergio Aguero’s last kick of the season title-winner against Queens Park Rangers in 2012 – a goal so astonishing I was convinced it was going to be disallowed a full ten seconds after the stadium, now called the Etihad of course, erupted like Mount Vesuvius in Naples two thousand years ago. Aguero suddenly looked like a bargain at a reported £35 million – the equivalent of around 87 Shaun Goaters.</span></p>\n<div><a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/video/data/2.0/video/sports/2012/05/13/ws-man-city-scores-last-seconds-mckay-davis.cnn.html\">Click to watch video</a></div>\n<p>This time they were undone by three other European league champions – Real Madrid, Borussia Dortmund and Ajax of Amsterdam.</p>\n<p>It took another season, ending as runners-up to United, before group qualification was secured for the first time by seeing off Plzen, CSKA Moscow and, spectacularly, the European champions Bayern Munich on their own ground.</p>\n<p>Yes, there have been a few glitches along the way. Roberto Mancini, the man who came from Italy to manage Man City, paid the price for two seasons of failure to get out of the group stages, failure to get on with key players and failure to beat soon-to-be-relegated Wigan in last season’s FA Cup Final.</p>\n<p>But in Manuel Pellegrini, City might - just might - have found the manager to do what was unthinkable a decade ago. An unprecedented quadruple is still being talked about for now.</p>\n<p>A big win in the FA Cup against Chelsea on Saturday and a home draw against last season’s winners Wigan in the quarterfinal means that impossible dream still lives on. And the dreams keep getting bigger.</p>\n<p>The ground Barcelona opened in 2003 is set to expand its capacity to 62,000 within two years. On Tuesday night, when Messi walks onto the pitch in front of 46,000 fans in the unfashionable east end of Manchester, it will mark another step on City’s £650 million petrol-powered journey.</p>\n<p>Ten seasons ago, City won that friendly 2-1. Nicolas Anelka scored the first goal at the new stadium. Meaningless fun.</p>\n<p>It’ll be anything but on Tuesday.</p><br> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/cnniworldsport.wordpress.com/10206/\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/cnniworldsport.wordpress.com/10206/\" border=\"0\"></a> <img height=\"1\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=worldsport.blogs.cnn.com&amp;blog=8188608&amp;post=10206&amp;subd=cnniworldsport&amp;ref=&amp;feed=1\" border=\"0\"><img height=\"1\" width=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/rss/edition_worldsportblog/~4/q5_87XpdeA0\">","direction":"ltr"},"canonical":[{"href":"http://worldsport.blogs.cnn.com/2014/02/17/barcas-return-to-manchester/","type":"text/html"}],"enclosure":[{"href":"http://i1.wp.com/i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/140217164343-football-man-city-barcelona-2003-story-top.jpg?resize=120%2C68","length":28800,"type":"image/jpeg"}],"origin":{"htmlUrl":"http://worldsport.blogs.cnn.com","streamId":"feed/http://rss.cnn.com/rss/edition_worldsportblog.rss","title":"CNN World Sport"},"summary":{"content":"The last time Manchester City played Barcelona, I got Shaun Goater to sign the match program.

In the 1960s, during the height of the Cold War, the United States of America and the Soviet Union took the world to the brink of nuclear war over 13 long days of missile mayhem in Cuba.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n<div>How nice then, that in 2014, not only are we all still alive and breathing but that relations have improved to such an extent that when the mother country of the USSR, Russia, now hosts an Olympics, America turns up to participate.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Better still, all of the historical grievances, cultural differences and national posturing can live on, peacefully, through the prism of a sport both nations are completely united in their passion for: ice hockey.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n<div>It's the game that always takes top billing at the Winter Olympics, the men's final has a box-office appeal that no other event can match. And it's easy to see why.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n<div>The crowd is vociferous, partisan and passionate. The athletes put in shift after shift of lung-busting grind across the ice, the tackles are violent and plentiful, the play is slick and speedy, the goals are often spectacular and the organ music, emcee and Jumbotron combine to get you rocking in your seat.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n<div>When the arena is the Bolshoy Ice Dome in Sochi the effect has the atavistic hairs on your neck standing to attention before you've even sat down.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Rivalries in sport are so much greater when there is a symbolism to the result that reaches beyond the game. In a time when Russia is emerging onto the world stage, playing host to such events as the Olympics and World Cup, while America anxiously looks to a growing China as the second biggest global economy, there is much to ponder.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Not that such deliberations were in the minds of Alexander Ovechkin or Zac Parise as they took to the ice to help produce an enthralling game. It was the navy blue of the Americans that started the stronger, dominating the play and battering the white defensive wall of the Russians with wave after wave of attack.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n<div>But the home side regrouped, remembered the grudge and with renewed purpose moved into the lead in the second period through a goal by Detroit Red Wings star Pavel Datsyuk. If the crowd had been febrile up to this point, the goal delivered a collective release of decibels so large it served to test the newly installed roof. The ceiling survived by the skin of its teeth.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Like a pugilist dazed by a hook to the jaw but still with enough guts to resist the downward pull of the canvas, the U.S. steadied, shook themselves down and worked on the counter.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n<div>It paid off as Cam Fowler drew them level late in the second. The hot war between these two superpowers of the ice would now become attritional. The third was a gruelling battle that would test the energy of each of the side's NHL superstars.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n<div>The nature of the game played into America's hands, they dug in, kept hold of the puck and started to dominate possession . They plundered the Russian goal when Joe Pavelski hit home. It was a blow to the expectant home support and their volume dulled.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n<div><span>But their side produced a second wind. </span>When Dustin Brown was sent to the box for kneeing, Datsyuk benefitted from a screen set by Alexander Radulov to slam home his second and draw the scores level.

Oshie.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n<div>For these great nations it was another chapter to add to their hockey history. For an ice-hockey novice it was a baptism of exquisite fire.

Over half of our games are sell outs... but the world, and digital, are our oysters and we will absolutely see where that takes us.&quot;</p>\n<p>In the past, Stern has been happy to talk about the possibility of an NBA franchise, or even a whole division of teams, based abroad.</p>\n<p>It makes for a good headline but, when pushed, he admits they’re still a decade away from even discussing the prospect in a serious way.</p>\n<p>&quot;We’re going to have to wait until the game is more popular overseas,&quot; said Stern. &quot;It's increased in its popularity but it's not where we want to get it. &quot;</p>\n<p>And that's before we even get to the logistical challenges. </p>\n<p>An NBA team plays more than 80 regular season games over seven months, compared to a 16-game four-month season in the NFL. </p>\n<p>So no wonder Stern, half-jokingly, said, &quot;If I were the NFL I would think about a team [based abroad] because you could play a game in London. You could have a team there. Those guys have it easy.&quot;</p>\n<p>While it is more feasible for an NFL team, with only one game a week, to be seven hours away in London, it would be almost impossible for an NBA franchise in Europe to jet back and forth across the Atlantic several times a month.</p>\n<p>One indication that the NBA's international games are more about raising awareness than testing whether or not to base a team abroad is their social media strategy. </p>\n<p>Financial Times sports business correspondent Roger Blitz told me the NBA are already one up on the NFL in that sphere.</p>\n<p>With modern technology, it's never been easier for fans across the world to stay in touch with their American sporting heroes, whether they play basketball or football.</p>\n<p>Getting the occasional chance to see them play in person is a bonus but doesn't necessarily mean their favourite team is moving to a nearby city any time soon.</p><br> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/cnniworldsport.wordpress.com/10132/\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/cnniworldsport.wordpress.com/10132/\" border=\"0\"></a> <img height=\"1\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=worldsport.blogs.cnn.com&blog=8188608&post=10132&subd=cnniworldsport&ref=&feed=1\" border=\"0\"><img height=\"1\" width=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/rss/edition_worldsportblog/~4/phy3ChDEFQw\">","direction":"ltr"},"canonical":[{"href":"http://worldsport.blogs.cnn.com/2014/01/31/nfl-to-trump-nba-in-global-expansion-race/","type":"text/html"}],"enclosure":[{"href":"http://i2.wp.com/i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/140131131511-super-bowl-tease-left-tease.jpg?resize=120%2C68","length":28800,"type":"image/jpeg"}],"origin":{"htmlUrl":"http://worldsport.blogs.cnn.com","title":"CNN World Sport","streamId":"feed/http://rss.cnn.com/rss/edition_worldsportblog.rss"},"summary":{"content":"By Alex Thomas Having looked at both American Football and basketball’s plans to grow their markets beyond the U.S., my hunch is we should see an NFL team based overseas before an NBA franchise.

The British also have security measures in place.</p>\n<div><a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/video/data/2.0/video/bestoftv/2014/01/28/ac-npw-sochi-security.cnn.html\">Click to watch video</a></div>\n<p>A number of athletes I've spoken to in the last couple of months aren't going to enjoy the party as they have at previous Games – instead they’re going to spend the shortest time they can in the region, going in and out of Sochi as close as possible to their events.</p>\n<p>There is, of course, the school of thought that while these threats should be taken seriously, Sochi could well be the safest place on the planet in February, and that it's elsewhere in Russia that will feel the brunt of the threats.</p>\n<p>The International Olympic Committee has said it’s confident the Games will be safe, and Russia has established an unprecedented “ring of steel” comprising members of the police, army and security forces. In total, the Ministry of Interior says it plans to deploy 37,000 security personnel, compared to 12,000 police and security for London 2012 (with 18,000 troops on standby) – an event that was significantly bigger.</p>\n<p>I want to go to Sochi, throw myself into the Games and give my all to telling the fantastic story of the likes of the Jamaican bobsled team, of Shaun White’s latest tricks as he aims for a third Olympic gold, and the controversial Norwegian cross country skier Marit Bjorgen. My role is to travel around the city and the venues, and tell the stories that need to be told.</p>\n<div><a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/video/data/2.0/video/us/2014/01/28/ac-intv-peter-king-sochi-olympics-security.cnn-ap.html\">Click to watch video</a></div>\n<p>But sitting in the cable car heading up the mountain at the Rosa Khutor alpine resort, glancing at the range that leads to Chechnya; or when I'm standing in the crowd at the bottom of the ski jump area and see someone shifty-looking with a backpack; or as I go through another security check point to get on the new high-speed train line between the coastal zone and mountain resort ... at the moment it feels like it will be difficult to shake off the pervading sense of security that appears to be enveloping the Games.</p>\n<p>President Putin has talked of the Winter Olympics as Sochi’s moment to shine. And I really hope it does. The Olympics is one of those rare and special events where the eyes of the world are watching. And with the controversial buildup to Sochi – with the anti-gay propaganda laws, human rights issues and escalating costs – you’d expect even more eyes than normal.</p>\n<p>The problem is, as we’ve seen in the past – with the Munich massacre at the 1972 Summer Games, and the Centennial Olympic Park bombing at Atlanta 1996 – there are those who see it as an opportunity to get their voices heard.</p>\n<p>Two years ago, despite all the security concerns, the London Games managed to create a remarkable atmosphere as fans flocked to its events.

With colossal sponsorship deals coming his way, there was an early season fallout with his management team, at a time when he was clearly unsettled on the golf course.</p>\n<p>That development only accelerated his poor form and it wasn’t until September, as he announced the formation of his own company and plans to tackle the legal issues concerning his split from Horizon Sports management, that he began to see light at the end of the tunnel. By no means resolved, the feeling is that the legal issues between both sides will be settled before the case is due to be heard before Dublin’s commercial court this September.</p>\n<div><a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/video/data/2.0/video/sports/2013/12/05/spc-living-golf-tennis-stories-2013.cnn.html\">Click to watch video</a></div>\n<p>For Woods, there is an undeniable pressure to win a grand slam tournament in 2014.

He has won on three of this year’s major venues (Augusta, Hoylake and Valhalla) and Torrey Pines was his first event back after a winter break which was not filled with golf, but more on his duties as a single father and, where possible, taking a break.</p>\n<p>That rust was in evidence in San Diego, but it doesn’t tend to last too long.</p>\n<p>The signs are certainly very positive in Camp McIlroy here in Dubai and the feeling is that he is close to his best. Already installed as the 7/2 favorite, ahead of Woods at 6/1, Rory has been hard at work since the beginning of January, days after <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2014/01/01/sport/golf/mcilroy-wozniacki-engaged-twitter/index.html\">proposing to girlfriend Caroline Wozniacki on a boat in Sydney Harbour on New Year’s Eve. </a></p>\n<p>It’s been a tough regime of gym work, range work, golf and more gym activity before unwinding to an early bed. The form has been impressive, with<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2014/01/19/sport/golf/golf-abu-dhabi-2014/index.html\"> a tied second place alongside Phil Mickelson down the road in Abu Dhabi a fortnight ago</a>. It could have been a victory too, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2014/01/18/sport/golf/mcilroy-abu-dhabi-penalty/index.html\">had he not incurred a two-shot penalty in the penultimate round.</a></p>\n<p>Sources close to the McIlroy team have spoken of a recent round of 10-under-par 62 while playing with friends at the local Els Club in Dubai, and those who have witnessed his practice sessions on the range at the nearby Butch Harmon school have remarked on his impressive accuracy with his short game sessions in particular.</p>\n<p>With his renowned long game, he looks to be back to his best, putting the club in a great position on the backswing, which allows him to hit the ball a little more from the inside, while maintaining a nice square clubface through impact.</p>\n<p>The class of both players is undeniable, but this week, it’s form that should dictate which of these big draws makes it to the top of the podium.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Do you think McIlroy will be a major contender this year?

Novotna famously cried on the Duchess of Kent's shoulder after losing a Wimbledon final to Steffi Graf.</p>\n<p>Federer would soon be back on the winner’s podium, and over the following months would get the opportunity to hear some of the most memorable runner-up speeches.</p>\n<p>After the 2009 French Open final, having lost to Federer in straight sets, Robin Soderling joked: &quot;Nobody beats Robin Soderling 13 times in a row.&quot;</p>\n<p>Not so jovially, a few weeks later, Andy Roddick called out &quot;You've won five times!&quot; in response to Federer's assertion that he knew how Andy was feeling after his excruciatingly close five-set loss in the Wimbledon final. </p>\n<p>In 2010, perhaps the humblest of speeches was uttered by a man not known at the time for his humility, when Andy Murray proclaimed: &quot;I can cry like Roger. It's just a shame I can't play like him.&quot;</p>\n<p>It was a statement which helped win the Scot a raft of new fans.</p>\n<p>Professional tennis is competing with a multitude of sports for television revenue, sponsorship and ticket sales, and these speeches - often revealing players' humanity when their defences are down – arguably helps fans connect to the game's stars and just as importantly they make headlines. The media can't get enough of them.</p>\n<p>Unlike in team sports, where support for clubs is often passed down in the family and developed in communities, maintaining and growing a fan base in an individual sport such as tennis is dependent on establishing personal connections between the players and supporters. </p>\n<p>Seeing these players shed a few tears or a little humility helps show that these guys are people - just like you and me.</p>\n<p>So, as a tradition, it is bizarre and as a requisite, it's brutal, but for the growth of the game, it is crucial.</p><br> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/cnniworldsport.wordpress.com/10120/\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/cnniworldsport.wordpress.com/10120/\" border=\"0\"></a> <img height=\"1\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=worldsport.blogs.cnn.com&blog=8188608&post=10120&subd=cnniworldsport&ref=&feed=1\" border=\"0\"><img height=\"1\" width=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/rss/edition_worldsportblog/~4/9i16wpt_fxI\">","direction":"ltr"},"published":1390912346000,"title":"Tennis' bizzare convention of the losing speech","updated":1390912346000,"alternate":[{"href":"http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_worldsportblog/~3/9i16wpt_fxI/","type":"text/html"}],"enclosure":[{"href":"http://i1.wp.com/i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/140128114802-nadal-tease-story-top.jpg?resize=120%2C68","length":28800,"type":"image/jpeg"}],"canonical":[{"href":"http://worldsport.blogs.cnn.com/2014/01/28/tennis-bizzare-convention-of-the-losing-speech/","type":"text/html"}],"author":"jsinnottcnn","crawled":1390912374207,"origin":{"htmlUrl":"http://worldsport.blogs.cnn.com","title":"CNN World Sport","streamId":"feed/http://rss.cnn.com/rss/edition_worldsportblog.rss"},"summary":{"content":"By Will Edmonds Almost five years to the day after reducing then world No. 1 Roger Federer to tears after capturing his first, and to-date only Australian Open, Rafael Nadal shed a few of his own when the Spaniard stood up to give a speech after losing the Australian Open final to Stanislas Wawrinka.

Right away they were impressed by him. The first point they will have noticed is that he a straight-talker.”</p>\n<p>In his autobiography, Ferguson makes mention that he knew Moyes’ family. “They have a good family feel about them. I’m not saying that’s a reason to hire someone but you like to see good foundations in someone appointed to such high office.”</p>\n<p>At the time of Moyes' appointment, Ferguson outlined why his fellow Scot got the job.</p>\n<p>&quot;David is a man of great integrity with a strong work ethic. I've admired his work for a long time and approached him as far back as 1998 to discuss the position of assistant manager here.</p>\n<p>&quot;There is no question he has all the qualities we expect of a manager at this club,” added Ferguson of a man who failed to win a trophy while manager of Everton.</p>\n<p>Don’t forget that when Ferguson was appointed United manager he had guided Aberdeen to Scottish Premier League success as well as an impressive European Cup Winners’ Cup final win over Real Madrid.</p>\n<p>Manchester United chief executive Ed Woodward also said Moyes had “all the skills needed to build on United’s phenomenal legacy,&quot; but clearly key to the Scot’s appointment was Ferguson.</p>\n<p>&quot;I am delighted that Sir Alex saw fit to recommend me for the job,” said Moyes when he has named as Ferguson’s replacement.</p>\n<p>At the moment on <a href=\"http://www.experteer.co.uk/vacancies/job/manchester-united\">one recruitment website</a> there are five Manchester United jobs being advertised in executive roles ranging from relationship manager to staffing manager. </p>\n<p>Jobs that the club deemed fit to advertise externally and use a company that describes itself as “executive career service for high calibre professionals.”</p>\n<p>Yet when it comes to arguably the most important appointment at the club –- the manager –- that recruitment strategy went out of the window.</p>\n<p>But surely if you are as a successful club as United the process to appoint Ferguson’s successor should have seen no stone unturned to identify a shortlist of managers that had the potential to take on one of the toughest jobs in football?</p>\n<p>However, football is seemingly an industry that doesn’t obey any of the rules that might apply to other businesses. It’s often closed, distrustful of outsiders and even more distrustful of new ideas.</p>\n<p>I spoke to one recruitment consultant who said he was interested in helping clubs identify managers and players but all too often hit a brick wall of conservatism.</p>\n<p>Good luck to David Moyes and let’s hope he is given the time to turn things round at Old Trafford.</p>\n<p>No appointment can ever be future proofed and hindsight is an easy art, but arguably the start Roberto Martinez has made at Everton creates a plausible argument that Moyes’ steady as you go brand of management might not have been the wisest choice.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile United fans will be asking themselves this question: “is he the best manager for the club for the next 20 years?”</p><br> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/cnniworldsport.wordpress.com/10090/\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/cnniworldsport.wordpress.com/10090/\" border=\"0\"></a> <img height=\"1\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=worldsport.blogs.cnn.com&blog=8188608&post=10090&subd=cnniworldsport&ref=&feed=1\" border=\"0\"><img height=\"1\" width=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/rss/edition_worldsportblog/~4/guW5Thm3Srk\">","direction":"ltr"},"updated":1390409812000,"published":1390409812000,"title":"How not to appoint a football manager","author":"jsinnottcnn","crawled":1390409855828,"summary":{"content":"Just how are football managers appointed?

Sport and music are big players in the global entertainment industry, so it shouldn’t come as any surprise that they work together.</p>\n<p>On our high-definition televisions, sports highlights are often packaged up and edited to the beats of the day, and somehow they seem even <em>better</em> with a soundtrack.<span></span></p>\n<p>In Europe, Champions League soccer is as recognizable for its signature theme tune as it is for Messi and Ronaldo, and every February there’s almost as much interest in the halftime show as there is in the Super Bowl itself; in case you were wondering, it’s Bruno Mars and the Red Hot Chili Peppers playing next month.</p>\n<p>But in American football’s showpiece event, the music has a clearly defined place: the interval between the first and second half. In other sports, though, it’s harder to tell where one thing ends and the other begins.</p>\n<p>British basketball fans will know what I mean when the Atlanta Hawks play the Brooklyn Nets at London's O2 Arena on Thursday.</p>\n<p>The NBA claims to be the only major American sport where music can be heard during live play. Every team works from its own playlist, one which it feels is best suited to its own regional market, most of which is played by a DJ at appropriate intervals.</p>\n<p>But the Hawks are different, they’re one of only a handful of teams in the league to employ a live organist.</p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://twitter.com/Sir_Foster\">&quot;Sir Foster&quot;</a> provides the soundtrack to all of Atlanta’s home games and – since every match-up is different and unpredictable – no two of his performances are the same. His main job is to enhance the Hawks’ home-court advantage, combining the team’s signature chants like &quot;Go Hawks&quot; or &quot;D-fense&quot; with whatever melodies spring to mind.</p>\n<p>“The only way I can really describe it,” he told me before catching his flight to London, “is that I’m scoring a live-action play. You need to understand the ebb and flow of the game because the action on the floor dictates everything.”</p>\n<div><a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/video/data/2.0/video/bestoftv/2013/02/04/exp-point-singer-beyonce.cnn.html\">Click to watch video</a></div>\n<p>One of his first challenges was to learn how to play songs by Rihanna, Jay Z or The White Stripes in 24-second bursts (the time each team has to make a shot), knowing at any moment that he might have to break off for a change in possession.</p>\n<p>He estimates he could play as many as 16 different songs per night, but much less if it’s a tight game, when he’ll focus on leading the fans in supportive chants. It’s quite a skill, one that he says requires &quot;a focus of laser-like intensity&quot; as he keeps an ear on the crowd and an eye on both the action and the shot clock.</p>\n<p>Foster feels he can make the biggest difference when the away team has the ball. As the 24-second shooting window ticks down, he’ll amp it up, playing louder and faster, trying to unsettle them and rush them into making a shot.</p>\n<p>He knows he’s done his job when they miss, usually confirmed by his producer’s voice in his headset: “That one’s on you, Foster!”</p>\n<p>If organ music is your thing, then Atlanta is a good place to be a sports fan. Just down the road at the Braves stadium, Matthew Kaminski is the resident organist for the city’s baseball team.</p>\n<p>There’s nothing he can do when the ball is in play but at all other times he does everything he can to make the Braves feel at home – and naturally quite the opposite for the visitors.</p>\n<p>As the batters walk up to the plate, Kaminski has around 30 seconds to play their individual theme tunes. The home players all get to choose their musical identity – for example, Chipper Jones was identified by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwDpAfFzcRQ\">Ozzy Osbourne’s &quot;Crazy Train&quot;</a> for years – but the visitors don’t enjoy the same privilege.</p>\n<p>In fact, Kaminski is allowed to have a little fun at their expense on his Hammond organ.</p>\n<p>If your name happens to be <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mlb.mlb.com/team/player.jsp?player_id=457428#gameType='R'&sectionType=career&statType=2&season=2014&level='ALL'\">James McDonald</a>, you’ll be walking up to &quot;Old MacDonald Had A Farm.&quot; If you’re sporting a beard and bear a passing resemblance to the son of God, don’t be surprised to hear the Doobie Brothers’ &quot;Jesus Is Just Alright With Me.&quot;</p>\n<p>And if you hail from the Lone Star State, you may be treated to the county hit &quot;All My Exes Live In Texas.&quot;</p>\n<p>Asked how he’d score me, he started out with a play on my last name – &quot;riddle&quot; – before concluding, “Actually I’d just go with your first name, Don – 'The Godfather!' ”</p>\n<p>It’s all good-humored, and Kaminski’s songs have helped to create a long-running in-joke between him and the fans in the ballpark. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://twitter.com/bravesorganist\">He has almost 9,000 followers on Twitter</a> and claims to receive between 50 to 100 musical suggestions before every game.</p>\n<p>I used to live in Yorkshire – rugby league country – where I covered the creation of the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.superleague.co.uk/\">Super League</a> competition and a switch to a summer game in 1996.

In a match that he dominated in every phase of the game over Brazilian Thomaz Bellucci, the big-hitting Pole managed to turn the occasion into a verbal free-for-all between him and the heavily partisan crowd.</p>\n<p>He lost on the crowd, and lost the match. But his talent was obvious.</p>\n<p>Three months later, Janowicz appeared to have regained his composure and capitalized on early exits from Rafa and Roger <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.edition.cnn.com/2013/07/05/sport/tennis/tennis-wimbledon-djokovic-del-potro-murray/index.html\">to make a run to the semifinals of Wimbledon</a>, showing the world the frightening potential this athletic powerhouse possesses.</p>\n<p>Built in the Marat Safin mold, the 6 foot  8 inch  Janowicz is a force to be reckoned with. He’s got a massive serve, moves well, hits heavy from the baseline with apparent ease, and has the deftest of touch moving forward.</p>\n<p>If the 23-year-old can keep his composure and stop picking fights with the crowd, the sky's the limit.</p>\n<p><strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.atpworldtour.com/Tennis/Players/Top-Players/Milos-Raonic.aspx\">MILOS RAONIC</a></strong></p>\n<p>As the most accomplished of the “up and comers,” the big-serving Canadian has already claimed five ATP titles and cracked the top 10.</p>\n<p>Noticeably absent from Raonic’s resume are major scalps. In 13 attempts against Rafa Nadal, Novak Djokovic, Roger Federer and David Ferrer, the 22-year-old is yet to claim a single victory. Strikingly, however, he actually has <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.edition.cnn.com/2012/10/06/sport/tennis/tennis-murray-djokovic-sharapova/index.html\">a winning record (albeit only 2-1) against Wimbledon champ Andy Murray.</a></p>\n<p>After several years of slow but steady improvement, a favorable draw could see this talented big-hitter - <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cnn.com/video/data/2.0/video/sports/2011/11/21/ws-milos-raonic-interview.cnn.html\">the 2011 ATP newcomer of the year</a> - knock on the door of a grand slam title.</p>\n<p><strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.atpworldtour.com/Tennis/Players/Ca/P/Pablo-Carreno-Busta.aspx\">PABLO CARRENO BUSTA</a></strong></p>\n<p>This hitherto unknown is only the 12th-highest Spaniard in the ATP rankings and is yet to win a single set at a grand slam tournament. However, in 2013 Busta claimed a remarkable 92 victories, including 11 titles and a winning streak of 39 matches.</p>\n<p>Granted, these successes were at the second-tier Challenger level, but at any rate, one key ingredient a player needs to reach the top of the game is the ability to win week in, week out. It's a skill Busta has in abundance.</p>\n<p>He took French veteran Julien Benneteau to five sets before losing in the first round in Melbourne this week, and expect this 22-year-old to claim some big scalps during the clay-court swing of the tour and improve his ranking from 63rd.</p>\n<p><strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.atpworldtour.com/Tennis/Players/Ky/N/Nick-Kyrgios.aspx\">NICK KYRGIOS</a></strong></p>\n<p>Back in March 2013, the Australian teenager won the Sydney Challenger event, becoming only the 16th player to ever claim a second-tier professional title before turning 18.</p>\n<p>Those who had come before him included Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic, Juan Martin Del Potro, Tomas Berdych, Richard Gasquet, Lleyton Hewitt and Marat Safin, who between them have 24 grand slam titles and currently occupy half the spots in the world’s top 10.</p>\n<p>If ever there was an indicator of future success, this would be it. And to emphasize his potential, just weeks before he became the junior world No. 1 by winning the Australian Open boys' title.</p>\n<p>Equally impressive was his debut on the biggest stage, eliminating former top-10 player Radek Stepanek in the first round at Roland Garros in May in three straight tiebreak sets. He reached a high of 177th in the rankings, also qualifying for the main draw of the U.S. Open.</p>\n<p>Whether or not 2014 will be the season Kyrgios breaks through is hard to say - he won his first-round match in Melbourne this week - but watch out for this talented 18-year-old in the near future.</p>\n<p><em>Which players are you tipping for the top?

Unfortunately, that unity came about through a mutual hostility towards FIFA.</p>\n<p>Then there’s Bayern president Uli Hoeness, who claimed that Ribery wouldn’t win, reportedly telling Munich newspaper Abendzeitung that it “doesn’t suit one or two people’s plans that FC Bayern win everything.”</p>\n<p>Club rivalry, personal bias, cronyism – it’s all there in abundance when it comes to the voting process.</p>\n<p>The vote is supposed to crown the best player in the world as a winner and while it succeeds – Raul’s failure in 2001 aside – there is evidence of coaches voting for their own players and players rewarding friends.</p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.fifa.com/mm/document/ballond'or/playeroftheyear(men)/01/98/07/84/fboawardmenplayer2012-bycountry.pdf\">An open vote means everyone gets to see – conclusions can be easily drawn from there.</a></p>\n<p>Messi didn’t even place Ronaldo in his top three last year or this time – though there aren’t three better players in the world than him, four given that Messi can’t vote for himself.</p>\n<p><span>Then there is Germany coach Joachim Low, who last year inexplicably left both Ronaldo and Messi out of his top three, instead voting for Mesut Ozil and Manuel Neuer, both members of his national side. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.fifa.com/mm/document/ballond'or/playeroftheyear(men)/02/26/02/68/fboaward_menplayer2013_neutral.pdf\">This year Low didn't vote at all </a></span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.fifa.com/mm/document/ballond'or/playeroftheyear(men)/02/26/02/68/fboaward_menplayer2013_neutral.pdf\"><span>– though Germany captain Philipp Lahm went for his Bayern clubmate Ribery ahead of Ronaldo.</span></a></p>\n<p>Messi’s Argentina coach Alejandro Sabella voted for his star player and, unlike last year when he ignored Ronaldo completely, put the Real Madrid forward third. Portugal coach Paulo Bento omitted Messi from his top three.</p>\n<p>Of course, this is an open and democratic vote, but it’s difficult to take it seriously when it’s blighted by accusations of cronyism.</p>\n<p>Then there is the discussion on how you even calculate what is meant by the &quot;best player in the world.&quot;</p>\n<p>Take Messi, an undoubted genius, a man who has produced feats of magic beyond most ordinary human beings – but surely his success depends on the quality which surrounds him.</p>\n<p>Would he be able to showcase such skills without Xavi and Andres Iniesta in midfield or Gerard Pique and Carles Puyol ensuring the defense remained tightly shut?</p>\n<p>Could he repeat those scintillating bursts and sumptuous strikes in a lesser side? Would his goals count just as much if the standard of his team's defense was of a more porous nature?</p>\n<p>It is, of course, all hypothetical – nobody will ever agree on who is the greatest to have played the game, the Pele vs. Diego Maradona debate still rages to this very day.</p>\n<p>And that is why this award, is on the whole, rather superfluous.</p>\n<p>Ronaldo may have won on this occasion but that does not persuade the public that he is a better player than Messi – he has enjoyed a more successful year but would he have won had the Argentine been free of injuries?</p>\n<p>Would Ronaldo have lifted the trophy if Messi had been anywhere near his physical peak? The answer is probably no.</p>\n<p>As pleasing as personal triumphs are, nobody who really knows their football will look at how many times a player won this trophy as a primary indicator of their career success.</p>\n<p>Instead, they will look at league titles, World Cups, domestic cups, international caps, goals scored. There are a whole host of categories to be examined before the words “Ballon” and “d’Or” even creep into the consciousness.</p>\n<p>Both Messi and Ronaldo will go down in history as great players, but the debate as to who was the greatest will continue to rage for years to come.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Have your say in the comments box below or at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://twitter.com/WorldSportCNN\">@WorldSportCNN</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/worldsportcnn\">on Facebook</a>.</strong></em></p><br> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/cnniworldsport.wordpress.com/10069/\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/cnniworldsport.wordpress.com/10069/\" border=\"0\"></a> <img height=\"1\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=worldsport.blogs.cnn.com&blog=8188608&post=10069&subd=cnniworldsport&ref=&feed=1\" border=\"0\"><img height=\"1\" width=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/rss/edition_worldsportblog/~4/_WXmShhQi5U\">","direction":"ltr"},"enclosure":[{"href":"http://i1.wp.com/i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/140113192434-cristiano-ronaldo-ballon-story-top.jpg?resize=120%2C68","length":28800,"type":"image/jpeg"}],"alternate":[{"href":"http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_worldsportblog/~3/_WXmShhQi5U/","type":"text/html"}],"canonical":[{"href":"http://worldsport.blogs.cnn.com/2014/01/13/ballon-dor-awards-whats-the-point/","type":"text/html"}],"origin":{"htmlUrl":"http://worldsport.blogs.cnn.com","title":"CNN World Sport","streamId":"feed/http://rss.cnn.com/rss/edition_worldsportblog.rss"},"summary":{"content":"The two greatest players in a generation – a host of conspiracy theories and an award ceremony which will lead to yet more debate over which man really rules the world.

Although he immediately retired from football following the announcement, he returned to action three months later with the Los Angeles Galaxy.</p>\n<div><a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/video/data/2.0/video/sports/2013/04/30/ac-intv-rogers-gay-soccer-player.cnn.html\">Click to watch video</a></div>\n<p>“The initial reaction that I saw was just very supportive,” <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2014/01/09/sport/football/robbie-rogers-gay-sport/index.html\">Rogers told CNN</a>. “I was surprised by the number of people that reached out.

It is churlish to claim that fans are the problem – I’ve seen enough sensible and encouraging support from the general public to know that.</p>\n<p>It is up to FIFA and the associations of each country to clamp down on homophobic abuse in the way they do on racism, even if those sanctions appear laughable at times.</p>\n<p>We should not be living in a society where people are forced to repress their sexuality for fear of being lambasted and made to feel inferior.</p>\n<p>Gay, straight, black, white, Christian, Jewish, Muslim or Hindu – it doesn’t matter.

For 30-something of those, I had been one of the members of the British public watching, wishing, and waiting.</p>\n<p>And since 2005, Andy Murray has been the player shouldering that burden. He had been edging closer and closer, reaching the final in 2012, then claiming Olympic gold, followed by the U.S. Open crown. But with every step closer, so the pressure valve cranked up a notch. It will never again reach the level it did in that final. Two sets, 5-4, 40-love up against world No. 1 Novak Djokovic.</p>\n<p>Murray said he couldn't breathe. And neither could a nation. But on match point number four, with a Djokovic backhand into the net, all the years of hurt were forgotten, a weight was lifted.</p>\n<div><img height=\"234\" alt=\"\" width=\"416\" src=\"http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/131217124855-amanda-andy-murray-c1-main.jpg\"><p><i>Amanda Davies sat down with Andy Murray the morning after his Wimbledon triumph.</i></p></div>\n<p>Sitting down with the first British men's singles Wimbledon champion since Fred Perry in 1936, the morning after the night before, was a privilege. It may sound flippant, but he really did seem a changed man from the one I had spoken to before.</p>\n<p><strong>2.</strong> I was awoken by the phone ringing in the early hours of the morning. The words I heard: &quot;Oscar Pistorius has shot his girlfriend. She's dead.&quot; They were some of the most difficult words of the year to comprehend.</p>\n<p>Just six months after I'd interviewed Pistorius in London amidst the celebration that was the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games, I was suddenly talking about a murder trial.</p>\n<p>There are still so many questions, and still a very long way to go until the case reaches court. But this was without doubt the most shocking and tragic sport story of 2013.</p>\n<p><strong>3.</strong> You never dared believe this one would happen. But trust Sir Alex - aged 71 - to catch us all unaware. We were all ready for him to retire 12 years ago before he changed his mind.</p>\n<p>Twelve major titles later, at 0917 on the morning of May 8, the Manchester United press office announced the news with a simple tweet: &quot;Sir Alex Ferguson retires. #thankyousiralex.&quot;</p>\n<p>As a lifelong United fan, I didn't need any encouragement to wax lyrical about &quot;The Boss.&quot; But his impact in his 27 years at Old Trafford was so great that there was more demand for coverage of this breaking story from Manchester than any other that I've covered in my time at CNN.</p>\n<p>Not just from sports shows, but news, and business too - in America, Europe and Asia. The man who saw off the challenge of Liverpool, Newcastle United and Arsenal. The Scot who led some of the best players the Premier League has ever seen - the likes of Eric Cantona, David Beckham, Cristiano Ronaldo, Ryan Giggs and Ruud van Nistelrooy. The struggles of his successor David Moyes simply serve to highlight what an incredible job he did.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/mckaycnn\">Mark McKay</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong>1.</strong> There are waits, and then there’s the wait that Britain endured between men’s singles champions at Wimbledon.</p>\n<p>Seventy-seven years is a long time and Andy Murray proved that patience and perseverance can indeed pay off.</p>\n<div><img height=\"234\" alt=\"\" width=\"416\" src=\"http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2013/images/12/17/mckay.superbowl.jpg\"><p><i> Mark McKay reporting live from SuperBowl XLVII in New Orleans back in February.</i></p></div>\n<p>Winning Olympic gold at London 2012 on the hallowed grounds of the All-England Club no doubt boosted his confidence. Winning his first grand slam in New York City three months later laid the foundation for his inspired performance in this year's Wimbledon final where he beat 2011 champion Djokovic in straight sets.</p>\n<p><strong>2.</strong> “Inspiring” is one of the words most commonly associated with Oscar Pistorius. He overcame a birth defect to become a Paralympic champion and an Olympian.</p>\n<p>Pistorius represented his nation around the world with a squeaky clean image that was a sport marketer’s dream. On Valentine’s night 2013, Pistorius was at the center of a tragedy that shook South Africa to its core when his girlfriend Steenkamp was found dead at his residence.</p>\n<p>Pistorius was charged with murder and has maintained his innocence. A trial date is set for March 2014.</p>\n<p><strong>3.</strong> When someone denies, denies, and denies the presumption of innocence exists on some level.</p>\n<p>For Lance Armstrong, years of denials failed to clear the cloud of suspicion that constantly hung over the seven-time Tour de France champion.</p>\n<p>Facing a mountain of evidence, and having his Tour titles stripped, Armstrong did what many believed he’d never do: Admit on the record that he took performance-enhancing drugs.</p>\n<p>January’s television interview with Oprah Winfrey was, at times, uncomfortable to watch as a sportsman who meant so much to so many confirmed what many refused to believe.</p>\n<p>Perhaps there were lessons learned from Armstrong’s confession - not for the cyclist himself, but for those of us who hold athletes in high esteem.</p>\n<p>Do so at your own risk!</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/donriddellCNN\">Don Riddell</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong>1.</strong> Most Brits wouldn’t consider themselves &quot;tennis fans&quot;’ but many of us tune in for a fortnight every summer to watch Wimbledon, hoping that a homegrown player will finally end the drought in the men’s championship.</p>\n<p>With Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal crashing out early, we knew that Scotland’s Andy Murray might never get a better chance, and he seized it with a dramatic win against Djokovic in the final.</p>\n<p>I wish I’d been there to see it, but I called it live on World Sport and because I knew what it meant to the country and Murray himself, I had to keep my own emotions in check for our global audience! It was Rafa’s year, but this is my top three so I’m going with Murray!</p>\n<p><strong>2.</strong> The news that Oscar Pistorius had shot his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp to death was certainly not a great sport story, but it was one that dominated our headlines back in February.</p>\n<div><img height=\"234\" alt=\"\" width=\"416\" src=\"http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/131217125153-amanda-oscar-pistorius-c1-main.jpg\"><p><i>Amanda Davies spoke with Oscar Pistorius during the London 2012 Olympic Games.</i></p></div>\n<p>Unlike Lance Armstrong’s mea culpa, this was a shocking event that took all of us by surprise. I had previously met Oscar, and found him to be a charming and inspirational young man; whatever the outcome of his trial next year, all that he has achieved and everything uplifting that he stood for will be forgotten.</p>\n<p>For everyone concerned, it’s a desperately tragic tale.</p>\n<p><strong>3.</strong> For so long, Barcelona have dominated the European football narrative but it all ended that night in April when they were thrashed 4-0 by Bayern Munich.</p>\n<p>The Bavarian giants effectively booked their place in the final after the home leg of their semifinal and within a matter of weeks, Bayern had won the European Champions League, the Bundesliga and the German Cup - an unprecedented German treble that had eluded them twice before. It was hard not to be impressed, and just as Bayern were emerging as the pre-eminent force on the continent, they recruited Barca’s former coach Pep Guardiola. The early signs are that they might now be even better.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/PATRICKCNN\">Patrick Snell</a></strong><br>\n<strong>1.</strong> 2013 will be forever known as the year Lance Armstrong came clean. The athlete who had conquered cancer appeared to have it all. The worldwide respect and admiration of millions. His legacy seemed untarnished. In January all that changed when the Texan admitted to doping in a two-part television interview.</p>\n<p>With that, in one fell swoop, went every last ounce of credibility. Cycling’s ultimate fighter, the one I’d once in vain chased down the Champs-Elysees in Paris for an interview after yet another “triumph,” had fallen flat on his face.</p>\n<p>After a career spent denying it all, Armstrong’s mea culpa was at least one step in the right direction, though I’ll never fully grasp why he continues to believe he was being “ singled out” and targeted by USADA.</p>\n<a name=\"pd_a_7653577\"></a>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n<noscript><a href=\"http://polldaddy.com/poll/7653577\">Take Our Poll</a></noscript>\n<p>The Oprah interview answered some questions but left many unanswered. My challenge to Lance now: There’s still time, but only for the whole truth and nothing but the truth!</p>\n<p><strong>2.</strong> In a way it was entirely fitting Alex Ferguson chose 2013 to finally end his illustrious Manchester United career.</p>\n<p>He had just won the club's 20th English title while at the same time securing his 13th since taking over Britain's biggest club in 1986.</p>\n<p>I've gone for &quot;Fergie&quot; quite simply because of the sheer enormity of it all. Twenty-six years at the helm, 1,500 matches in charge and 38 trophies - a glittering haul that also included five English FA Cups and two European Cups.</p>\n<p>But it's not just that Ferguson was a winning machine, it was also his dedication in nurturing young talent that will live long in my memory: Scholes, Giggs, Ronaldo and Beckham.</p>\n<p>Another key reason for his unparalleled success was Ferguson's ability to rule United with an iron fist. Just ask Roy Keane, Van Nistelrooy or even Beckham, who he abruptly sold to Real Madrid in 2003.</p>\n<p>No one player was ever bigger than Manchester United. In terms of durability and his relentless winning mentality over the course of three decades - if you include his successful period at Aberdeen too - he simply has no match.<br>\nFor many, including myself, he rightly goes down as the best ever.</p>\n<p><strong>3.</strong> I simply couldn't omit the credentials of Fergie's fellow Scot Andy Murray. He makes my top 3 just because - to put it in plain English - he did it. Finally! Never again will I have to pen those weary words: &quot;No Brit has won Wimbledon since 1936.&quot; He'd been threatening it for a good while and it was certainly well merited. While I do wonder how many slams he'll eventually go on to claim, nobody can ever take this one away from him.</p>\n<p>As someone who's covered Wimbledon at the All-England Club I've witnessed first-hand the agonies of the long-suffering British public.</p>\n<p>A momentous achievement - one which even triggered an all-too-rare smile from Murray. Now I guess I'm reduced to writing &quot;No ENGLISHMAN has won Wimbledon since 1936!&quot;</p>\n<p>So there you go. My top 3 picks for 2013. Oh, and to think I never mentioned Australia regaining the Ashes!</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/alexthomascnn\">Alex Thomas</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong>1.</strong> Kevin-Prince Boateng walking off the pitch during a friendly for AC Milan back in January sparked football's fight against racism into life. A huge groundswell of support for his response to abuse from the stands from fans of lower league team Pro Patria finally forced the sport's governing bodies into action.</p>\n<div><img height=\"234\" alt=\"\" width=\"416\" src=\"http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/131217125719-alex-fifa-headquarters-c1-main.jpg\"><p><i>Alex Thomas and CNN crew on the ground at FIFA Headquarters.</i></p></div>\n<p>FIFA set up an anti-racism task force and sanctions are being unified and toughened across all federations. Now it's up to the authorities to enforce those new rules and mirror society's growing intolerance for inequality and discrimination.</p>\n<p>For me, it narrowly trumps Nigeria's African Cup of Nations victory over plucky Burkina Faso - which I was lucky enough to be at - and Bayern Munich's all-conquering season, culminating in their fifth Champions League triumph.</p>\n<p><strong>2.</strong> In tennis, Serena Williams, in the year she turned 32, has been extraordinary; Just four defeats, and 11 titles from 16 tournaments including two grand slam victories.</p>\n<p>She's the first woman to earn $10 million in prize money in one season. In my opinion, that puts her narrowly ahead of Rafael Nadal - who returned to the top of the men's rankings, and Andy Murray's emotional Wimbledon win.</p>\n<p><strong>3.</strong> Ranked as low as 207th in the world at the start of 2012, Henrik Stenson's climb back up golf's rankings has left him breathing down the necks of Tiger Woods and Adam Scott.</p>\n<p>It was simply great fun to watch the Swede play in scintillating, swashbuckling fashion as he became the first to take the PGA Tour's FedEx Cup and Europe's equivalent, the Final Series.</p>\n<div><img height=\"234\" alt=\"\" width=\"416\" src=\"http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2013/images/12/17/riddell.stenson.jpg\"><p><i>Don Riddell interviewed Henrik Stenson for CNN's Living Golf show.</i></p></div>\n<p>@WorldSportCNN using the hashtag #WorldSportTop10</p><br> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/cnniworldsport.wordpress.com/9973/\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/cnniworldsport.wordpress.com/9973/\" border=\"0\"></a> <img height=\"1\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=worldsport.blogs.cnn.com&blog=8188608&post=9973&subd=cnniworldsport&ref=&feed=1\" border=\"0\"><img height=\"1\" width=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/rss/edition_worldsportblog/~4/7IVHjclBbfg\">","direction":"ltr"},"canonical":[{"href":"http://worldsport.blogs.cnn.com/2013/12/17/what-was-the-biggest-sport-story-of-2013/","type":"text/html"}],"enclosure":[{"href":"http://i2.wp.com/i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/131217115641-story-of-2013-tease-story-top.jpg?resize=120%2C68","length":28800,"type":"image/jpeg"}],"origin":{"htmlUrl":"http://worldsport.blogs.cnn.com","title":"CNN World Sport","streamId":"feed/http://rss.cnn.com/rss/edition_worldsportblog.rss"},"summary":{"content":"From the heights of achievement to the despair of fallen idols, it has been a game of two halves for sport in 2013.

The concept of promotion and relegation is totally alien to them, as is the notion that one team can play in up to four different “league-type” competitions every season.</p>\n<p>A mate of mine used to play in the NFL and we recently spent a whole lunch working through such matters before we arrived at the notion of international matches. The fact that a player could effectively be two-timing his main employer by also turning out for his country blew his mind.</p>\n<p>I struggled to explain how those national teams would be made up and the only way he could get his head around it was to think of them as “All-Star” line-ups.<span></span></p>\n<p>I suppose that’s a good analogy. An international football manager is tasked with picking the best players available to him, players who share a common nationality. That same rule doesn’t apply to the manager himself, though. Of the 32 teams heading to the 2014 World Cup in Brazil, roughly a third will be coached by “foreigners.”</p>\n<p>The top teams in Europe wouldn’t dream of looking abroad for a manager. In modern times, the continent’s last three World Cup winners – France (1998), Italy (2006) and Spain (2010) – have always been coached by one of their own. England, champion in 1966, recently dabbled with a Swede (Sven Goran Eriksson) and an Italian (Fabio Capello) but neither experience is remembered with much fondness.</p>\n<p>Which leads me back to the United States. In Brazil next year, they’ll be one of those teams with a foreigner on the touchline – Germany’s Jurgen Klinsmann.</p>\n<p>Soccer is still developing on this side of the Atlantic and they’d prefer a coach they perceive as &quot;the best&quot; rather than “one of their own.”</p>\n<div><a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/video/data/2.0/video/sports/2013/12/06/intv-klinsmann-world-cup.cnn.html\">Click to watch video</a></div>\n<p>It should be said that Klinsmann has based himself in California for the last 15 years and is married to an American. But there’s a deep reverence for the European game and a man who’s found considerable success there both as a player and a coach. Additionally, in the melting pot of the USA, many Americans identify with the countries of their family history – it’s quite OK to be from somewhere else.</p>\n<p>As far as his employers are concerned, Klinsmann transcends the debate and his nationality neatly bookends America’s relationship with German coaches; the legendry Dettmar Cramer briefly ran the national team in 1974 and sowed the seeds for the country’s training structure.</p>\n<p>It hasn’t always been a perfect match, however. A damning press report earlier this year identified serious divisions within the team, pointing to concerns about Klinsmann’s strategic acumen and communication skills.</p>\n<p>Following a dispiriting loss to Honduras in February, World Cup qualification could no longer be taken for granted. Klinsmann’s nationality was never used as a stick to beat him with, but it was a very unhappy camp.</p>\n<p>Then everything suddenly clicked. The team went on a record 12-game winning streak, winning the Gold Cup and topping their World Cup qualifying group by four points.</p>\n<p>On the day he was hired in 2011, Klinsmann told me he wanted a team that mirrored the country it represented, and two years later it has a very multicultural appearance.</p>\n<p>A quick glance at the roster reveals players born to immigrants from Haiti and Colombia and men whose parents are from Norway, Iceland, Mexico and Germany. Every socio-economic background is represented.</p>\n<p>Central to the Americans' success has been the confidence Klinsmann has instilled in the squad. An international manager sometimes feels as though he has to work with one hand tied behind his back; throughout the course of a year, the time spent working with their players is very limited. Klinsmann, though, has got his players believing that anything is possible, they have the ability to get where they want to go.</p>\n<p>But his biggest challenge is looming large on the horizon.</p>\n<p>Before the World Cup draw was made last week, the U.S. would have expected to make it into the knockout rounds.</p>\n<p>That was before they were grouped with two of the top five teams in the world, Germany and Portugal, plus the side that ended their hopes in the 2006 and 2010 tournaments, Ghana, with defeats in the first round in Germany and then the last 16 in South Africa.</p>\n<p>As Klinsmann revealed with a nervous laugh in his interview shortly afterwards, it was a brutally tough draw.</p>\n<p>Klinsmann’s home country is one of the favorites in Brazil. It’s the team he won the tournament with as a player in 1990 and led to third place as a manager in 2006. Now they’ll help shape his narrative as a manager in soccer’s new world, as he comes up against his former assistant Joachim Low - now in charge of Germany's national team.</p>\n<p>As is the case with any sport in any part of the world, it doesn’t matter where you’re from or what you’re like – just as long as you’re winning.</p>\n<p>The tens of thousands of American fans who’ll be making the short trip to Brazil are bracing themselves for what might be a short stay.</p>\n<p>Fortunately Klinsmann will be around for a while longer, Thursday’s news that the 49-year-old's contract has been extended until 2018 demonstrates that the U.S. are more than happy with a foreign coach and, in particular, this one.</p><br> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/cnniworldsport.wordpress.com/9989/\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/cnniworldsport.wordpress.com/9989/\" border=\"0\"></a> <img height=\"1\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=worldsport.blogs.cnn.com&blog=8188608&post=9989&subd=cnniworldsport&ref=&feed=1\" border=\"0\"><img height=\"1\" width=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/rss/edition_worldsportblog/~4/Y_X6XeMM5AU\">","direction":"ltr"},"canonical":[{"href":"http://worldsport.blogs.cnn.com/2013/12/13/jurgen-klinsmann-german-in-charge-of-u-s-world-cup-hopes/","type":"text/html"}],"enclosure":[{"href":"http://i1.wp.com/i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/131213101854-don-riddell-klinsmann-blog-tease-story-top.jpg?resize=120%2C68","length":28800,"type":"image/jpeg"}],"origin":{"htmlUrl":"http://worldsport.blogs.cnn.com","title":"CNN World Sport","streamId":"feed/http://rss.cnn.com/rss/edition_worldsportblog.rss"},"summary":{"content":"It’s always fun trying to explain European soccer to an American who has been raised solely on a diet of football and baseball.

However, Carter-Williams helped get the 76ers off to a hot start, potentially putting them in position for a playoff run this year.</p>\n<p>Even though he was the 11th pick in last June’s draft, the 22-year-old has easily been the most impressive rookie thus far.

Even with Carter-Williams’ hot start to the season, expect Oladipo to perform better and better as the season wears on.</p>\n<p><strong>Trey Burke, Point Guard – Utah Jazz</strong><br>\n<img height=\"234\" alt=\"\" width=\"416\" src=\"http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/131212105430-trey-burke-blog-c1-main.jpg\"><br>\nPossibly the hottest player during the 2013 NCAA Tournament, Burke started his professional career with high expectations. However, an injury stopped the former Michigan Wolverines All-American from starting the season on time, and he has only played in 11 games thus far this year. Nonetheless, in that time Burke has been impressive on a struggling team.</p>\n<p>The 21-year-old ranks third among rookies in points per game and second in assists per game on arguably the worst team in the league. If Burke can stay healthy, his production should be able to improve, despite the lack of talent around him.</p>\n<p><strong>Nate Wolters, Point Guard – Milwaukee Bucks</strong><br>\n<img height=\"234\" alt=\"\" width=\"416\" src=\"http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/131212105650-nate-wolters-c1-main.jpg\"><br>\nOne of the under-the-radar rookies coming into the season, Wolters is a second-round pick who’s proving to be way more valuable than experts expected he would be. Coming out of North Dakota State, it's safe to say he wasn’t a household name to many NBA fans. However, the 22-year-old deserves mention because of what he’s doing in Milwaukee.</p>\n<p>Wolters is third in assists among rookies, but he’ll have to improve his turnover rate if he wants to stay among this draft class’ elite. Overall though, he could go down as a steal for the Bucks.</p>\n<p><strong>Mason Plumlee, Power Forward – Brooklyn Nets</strong><br>\n<img height=\"234\" alt=\"\" width=\"416\" src=\"http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/131212105919-mason-plumlee-c1-main.jpg\"><br>\nComing out of college basketball powerhouse Duke, Plumlee had plenty of NBA scouts taking looks at him throughout the draft process. Even though he was drafted in the first round, I’m not sure many experts expected the type of production they’re getting out of him in Brooklyn.</p>\n<p>While the 23-year-old isn’t lighting the stat sheet like Oladipo or Carter-Williams, what is impressive about the 22nd pick of the 2013 draft is his efficiency rating. The Player Efficiency Rating (PER) is a system used to show how productive players are within their minutes played, and Plumlee currently ranks second behind Carter-Williams among rookies.</p>\n<p>What’s impressive is the average minutes in which Plumlee is posting his high PER, since he’s playing almost 20 minutes less a game than the other players on this list.</p>\n<p>While more minutes are sure to come throughout the season as he continues to make solid use of his time on the floor, Plumlee deserves recognition for the surprising work he’s put in thus far this season.</p><br> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/cnniworldsport.wordpress.com/9975/\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/cnniworldsport.wordpress.com/9975/\" border=\"0\"></a> <img height=\"1\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=worldsport.blogs.cnn.com&blog=8188608&post=9975&subd=cnniworldsport&ref=&feed=1\" border=\"0\"><img height=\"1\" width=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/rss/edition_worldsportblog/~4/xK2PVCqrc98\">","direction":"ltr"},"canonical":[{"href":"http://worldsport.blogs.cnn.com/2013/12/12/who-are-the-nbas-leading-rookies/","type":"text/html"}],"enclosure":[{"href":"http://i0.wp.com/i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/131212110616-nba-blog-tease-story-top.jpg?resize=120%2C68","length":28800,"type":"image/jpeg"}],"origin":{"htmlUrl":"http://worldsport.blogs.cnn.com","title":"CNN World Sport","streamId":"feed/http://rss.cnn.com/rss/edition_worldsportblog.rss"},"summary":{"content":"With the first quarter of the NBA season behind us, a number of rookies are busy making a name for themselves in the world's top basketball league.

But it is far better suited to a knockout tournament with a short group phase.</p>\n<div><a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/video/data/2.0/video/world/2013/12/04/thomas-world-cup-venues.cnn.html\">Click to watch video</a></div>\n<p>Ultimately, Argentina’s chances could hinge on four-time world player of the year Messi. Criticized in the past for failing to reproduce his club form at international level, he is finally delivering his best for Argentina in the same way he does for Barcelona, and scored 10 goals in 14 games during the qualifying competition for Brazil 2014.</p>\n<p>As I write, the diminutive genius is injured and not for the first time this season. However, I view that enforced absence as an advantage, possibly ensuring he will arrive at the World Cup finals more refreshed than he otherwise might have been - his physical frailty may stop Barca coach Gerardo Martino from overplaying his key forward as the Spanish club chases trophies.</p>\n<p>The case for Argentina isn’t watertight but the other reason I’m backing them is because of the even stronger doubts hanging over the other contenders.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2013/12/05/sport/football/2014-world-cup-draw-brazil\">Read: The 2014 World Cup draw explained</a></p>\n<p>Spain’s squad remains astonishingly talented but I feel the reigning world and double European champions will finally be undone by their lack of goals.</p>\n<p>In 2010, they lifted the title after four consecutive 1-0 wins in the knockout rounds. La Roja looked uninspiring at Euro 2012 until their demolition of Italy in the final, and during world cup qualifying they managed just 14 goals in 8 games – only the 25th best scoring performance in the UEFA zone.</p>\n<p>Germany, by contrast, were top scorers in the European section with 36 goals. They have a mouth-watering mix of young talent and experienced campaigners.</p>\n<p>However, 16 other countries had better defensive records and the Mannschaft’s matches against Sweden showed a worrying frailty at the back.</p>\n<p>Italy, world champions in 2006,  can never be discounted but the lack of a genuine star player - Andrea Pirlo will be past his 35th birthday and questions remain about Mario Balotelli's temperament - could count against the losing Euro 2012 finalist.</p>\n<div><a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/video/data/2.0/video/business/2013/12/04/intv-hainer-ceo-adidas-new-ball.cnn.html\">Click to watch video</a></div>\n<p>And what about the host nation? Brazil has a huge opportunity to remind the world why we fell in love with its brand of football but the country’s passion for the game could count against the team.</p>\n<p>When Brazil last hosted the tournament over 60 years ago, they were beaten to the title by Uruguay. The scrutiny will be a hundred times stronger this time.</p>\n<p>Neymar is their key man but his move to Barcelona is yet to be deemed a resounding success. Brazil must also contend with the double-edged sword of not having to qualify for the tournament.</p>\n<p>The hosts were always guaranteed a spot but this year's Confederation's Cup, which Luis Felipe Scolari's team won, is the only competitive football they have played in recent years.</p>\n<p>When discussing the contenders who could upset my pick, Argentina, you’ll notice I’ve gone for former champions. After 19 World Cups, we’ve only ever seen eight different nations triumph.</p>\n<p>The case could be made for a first-time winner. Belgium and the Netherlands have talented squads, while the top African nations – Cameroon, Nigeria, Ivory Coast and Ghana – all have the potential to reach the latter stages.</p>\n<p>Colombia is, arguably, the pick of the candidates to win a World Cup for the first time, especially with a mean defense and a prolific forward like Radamel Falcao leading their attack. However, in my opinion, no country has a more compelling case than Argentina.</p>\n<p>The 1978 and 1986 champions are poised to end a wait of more than a quarter of a century to lift football’s biggest prize.</p><br> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/cnniworldsport.wordpress.com/9961/\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/cnniworldsport.wordpress.com/9961/\" border=\"0\"></a> <img height=\"1\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=worldsport.blogs.cnn.com&blog=8188608&post=9961&subd=cnniworldsport&ref=&feed=1\" border=\"0\"><img height=\"1\" width=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/rss/edition_worldsportblog/~4/5VR4IEJdwg4\">","direction":"ltr"},"alternate":[{"href":"http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_worldsportblog/~3/5VR4IEJdwg4/","type":"text/html"}],"published":1386250827000,"crawled":1386252890936,"canonical":[{"href":"http://worldsport.blogs.cnn.com/2013/12/05/who-will-win-the-2014-world-cup/","type":"text/html"}],"enclosure":[{"href":"http://i0.wp.com/i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/131205124231-lionel-messi-argentina-story-top.jpg?resize=120%2C68","length":28800,"type":"image/jpeg"}],"origin":{"htmlUrl":"http://worldsport.blogs.cnn.com","title":"CNN World Sport","streamId":"feed/http://rss.cnn.com/rss/edition_worldsportblog.rss"},"summary":{"content":"Argentina will lift the World Cup on July 13, 2014 - and the country's third triumph in football’s biggest tournament will be the sweetest of them all because it will come in the back yard of South American rivals and hosts Brazil.

But after a few weeks on the trail of the four-time Formula One world champion for this weekend's Circuit special, I’ve changed my tune.</p>\n<p><span></span></p>\n<p>I still wouldn’t by any means claim to know Seb, but I think I’ve gained a much better understanding of the man himself and where he’s come from.</p>\n<p>While he was finishing the season with a flourish – notching up a record ninth straight win in Brazil – we were discovering where it all began for him, exploring a little town in the south west of Germany, about half an hour from Frankfurt.</p>\n<div><a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/video/data/2.0/video/sports/2013/11/23/ws-f1-jackie-stewart-formula-one-vettel-red-bull.cnn.html\">Click to watch video</a></div>\n<p>And I can tell you, Heppenheim is a million miles from the glitz and the glamor of the F1 paddock.</p>\n<p>It’s a place without designer clothes shops, without champagne bars and Michelin-starred restaurants. It has a population of just 27,000 (slightly more if you count the valleys either side).</p>\n<p>It’s a place where everything closes at 1 p.m. on a Friday, and primary school children are able to walk to and from school without an adult by their side. Where people live in the houses where their parents and grandparents were born. It’s somewhere without traffic – and where you can see the stars at night. Somewhere with so much going for it, but doesn’t shout about it.</p>\n<p>And maybe that’s the essence of Sebastian Vettel.</p>\n<p>Heppenheim is where he grew up and went to school, met his girlfriend, and where his family still lives.</p>\n<p>“I think he is authentic, a hard-working man,” says the town's mayor Rainer Burelbach.</p>\n<p>“He is quiet and not putting himself in the middle. And that’s what Heppenheim is. We are working hard, we are a good region, and we are authentic.”</p>\n<div><a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/video/data/2.0/video/sports/2013/10/04/spc-circuit-sebastian-vettel-david-coulthard.cnn.html\">Click to watch video</a></div>\n<p>Just as Vettel shies away from the publicity and his celebrity status, Heppenheim almost reluctantly owns up to its most successful resident.</p>\n<p>The locals are undoubtedly proud of his achievements, but they certainly don’t go overboard. Yes the local bakery sells Vettel fruit tarts, and there’s the odd banner hanging in a shop window.</p>\n<p>The local museum even has a Sebastian Vettel corner. But you have to go right to the top floor and to the back to reach it.</p>\n<p>It’s a town that loves a statue. So will there be a Vettel one installed any time soon, I asked the mayor?</p>\n<p>“I think he is not a man who would like that we do that,” he said. “I think we can see about it in 30, 40, 50 years – but now he is an active sportsman who is working very hard and he doesn’t like this show around him.”</p>\n<p>And we found the same understated pride at the Kerpen Kart Club, where Vettel started racing. Michael Schumacher as well.</p>\n<p>But the club certainly isn’t exploiting the success of its alumni.</p>\n<p>Tucked away in an old gravel pit outside Cologne, you’d drive straight past without a second glance if you didn’t have a bit of local knowledge or a top of the range sat-nav.</p>\n<p>If Heppenheim is a million miles from F1, this place is in the next galaxy.</p>\n<p>And this is where we found the man who gave me the biggest insight into Vettel. A man who has been part of the kart club for 35 years, and although now its president – he still runs and works in the shop at the circuit selling kart parts and kit.</p>\n<p>An incongruous setting for someone who is surely alongside the likes of Alex Ferguson as one of sport’s most successful managers.</p>\n<p>I’m not exaggerating. Gerhard Noack masterminded the careers of both Schumacher and Vettel – that’s 11 F1 titles and counting.</p>\n<p>Not that you’d know it to meet him. Noack is not a man to blow his own trumpet, or get carried away by his incredible achievements.</p>\n<p>He gave up his business to support Vettel in his early days. He acted as mechanic, coach, friend, mentor. But still says “I think I am just lucky” when asked his secret.</p>\n<p>There isn’t an ounce of inflated ego here.</p>\n<p>So the more I think of where Vettel grew up, of the man who guided a young Sebastian off the track, and of Schumacher’s legacy he’s following on it – then perhaps we’ve got it wrong.</p>\n<p>Those who booed, those who haven’t warmed to him and those who looked at F1's youngest four-time world champion with a perceived arrogance, maybe think again.</p>\n<p>It’s not the fact he’s changed – but the fact he hasn’t. He’s a normal 26-year-old from a small town in Germany, surrounded by a close-knit family and friends, who has worked incredibly hard to make the most of his sensational talent.</p>\n<p>But sadly, maybe Formula One and its fans expects more than that.</p><br> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/cnniworldsport.wordpress.com/9937/\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/cnniworldsport.wordpress.com/9937/\" border=\"0\"></a> <img height=\"1\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=worldsport.blogs.cnn.com&blog=8188608&post=9937&subd=cnniworldsport&ref=&feed=1\" border=\"0\"><img height=\"1\" width=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/rss/edition_worldsportblog/~4/VUFgtLbNlLA\">","direction":"ltr"},"alternate":[{"href":"http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_worldsportblog/~3/VUFgtLbNlLA/","type":"text/html"}],"canonical":[{"href":"http://worldsport.blogs.cnn.com/2013/12/04/sebastian-vettel-who-is-the-man-behind-the-wheel/","type":"text/html"}],"updated":1386158606000,"author":"tommcgowan","published":1386158606000,"title":"Sebastian Vettel: Who is the man behind the wheel?","origin":{"htmlUrl":"http://worldsport.blogs.cnn.com","title":"CNN World Sport","streamId":"feed/http://rss.cnn.com/rss/edition_worldsportblog.rss"},"summary":{"content":"Editor's note: CNN's The Circuit will screen a half-hour special on Sebastian Vettel at 1400 and 2130 Saturday Dec 7, 1030 Sunday Dec 8 and 0430 Monday Dec 9 (all times GMT).

Messi has scored an awful lot of goals. </p>\n<p>But is that still the case?</p>\n<p>At the age of 26, just as he is supposed to be entering his peak, why does the four-time world player of the year keep getting injured? </p>\n<p>The South American’s latest setback – a fresh injury to the hamstring which went earlier this month – will likely see him out of action until after Christmas.</p>\n<p>It’s his second injury of the campaign having earlier bruised his left thigh. Last season he missed several key games – most notably against Paris Saint-Germain and Bayern Munich in the latter stages of the European Champions League – with an earlier hamstring complaint. </p>\n<p>This is a crucial stage in the Argentine's career - especially with the World Cup just seven months away. </p>\n<p>Messi’s recent run of injuries has come as something of a surprise. Since 2008, when Messi was out of action for six weeks due to a left leg muscle tear, it’s been relatively smooth sailing.</p>\n<p>Much work has been done behind the scenes with Barcelona physio Juanjo Brau, who worked around the clock to ensure the Catalans' biggest asset was in mint condition. </p>\n<p>During the Pep Guardiola era, Brau - who no longer works day-to-day with Messi following a promotion - tried to curb the player’s natural explosiveness on the field of play.</p>\n<p>The goal to some extent has been to limit Messi’s work-rate, maximizing his all–round effectiveness and impact. </p>\n<p>To that end, it’s reported the player’s diet and sleeping patterns were closely scrutinized and then revamped. </p>\n<p>An injury-free Messi, under the stewardship of Guardiola, led Barca through a golden period in which the club secured four Spanish championships and two European Cups. </p>\n<p>Opportunities for rest have been few and far between. </p>\n<p>Constant globetrotting can't have helped him much either, not to mention the unwanted distractions of his recent tax case. </p>\n<p>For his sake and the good of all around him Messi needs a temporary breather from the game. This enforced absence may turn out to be a blessing in disguise.</p>\n<p>I don't doubt Barca will miss Messi. But this is one break he needs badly. His natural passion for the game – some might argue obsession – is something that must be curbed for his own sake.</p>\n<p>Even Messi’s fitness coach Fernando Signorini concedes as much, saying someone simply has to “set limits” for the player.</p>\n<p>The team will be fine without him for a short while. </p>\n<p>It will be a chance for Brazil star Neymar to take center stage and shine as he grows into life at the Camp Nou.</p>\n<p>Like Neymar, who will be Brazil’s brightest star when the country hosts the World Cup next year, Messi carries an extra burden when he pulls on his national jersey.</p>\n<p>So often over the years Messi been compared to the legendary Diego Maradona - living with the almost constant accusation that he doesn't perform for the Albiceleste as he does for Barcelona. </p>\n<p>The pressure on him going into Brazil 2014 as captain of Argentina is huge. To handle it Messi must be fully fit, well-rested and raring to go. </p>\n<p>Messi himself is rightly playing it cool saying he won’t rush himself back into action. He told Argentina’s “Ole” sports newspaper he would only return to football when he’s fully recovered. </p>\n<p>The forward added his recent spate of injuries is down to bad luck and he admits his misfortune has left him “sad and angry.”</p>\n<p>As Messi kicks his heels on the road to recovery, another La Liga superstar continues to bask in the limelight. </p>\n<p>Cristiano Ronaldo looks a shoe-in to land the coveted Ballon d’Or this year even though – unlike Messi – the Portuguese will end 2013 without a trophy. </p>\n<p>He’s been scoring for fun for Los Blancos, Ronaldo has an incredible 35 goals in his last 25 appearances, but it’s his form for his country that suggests a growing maturity on the international stage. </p>\n<p>His one–man demolition of Sweden really does say it all. He scored four goals over two legs to drag his compatriots all the way to Brazil, including a devastating hat-trick in Copehagen. </p>\n<p>CR7 now has 10 goals in nine matches for Portugal in 2013. That’s the first time he’s ever reached double digits for his country in a calendar year. </p>\n<p>The stage is now well and truly set for Ronaldo to have the tournament of his life in South America next year.</p>\n<p>A fully-fit Messi raring to go in Brazil coming face to face with Ronaldo’s Portugal? Now that’s something I personally can’t wait for.</p><br> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/cnniworldsport.wordpress.com/9924/\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/cnniworldsport.wordpress.com/9924/\" border=\"0\"></a> <img height=\"1\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=worldsport.blogs.cnn.com&blog=8188608&post=9924&subd=cnniworldsport&ref=&feed=1\" border=\"0\"><img height=\"1\" width=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/rss/edition_worldsportblog/~4/d3ZzN0voZSw\">","direction":"ltr"},"alternate":[{"href":"http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_worldsportblog/~3/d3ZzN0voZSw/","type":"text/html"}],"canonical":[{"href":"http://worldsport.blogs.cnn.com/2013/11/25/is-lionel-messi-at-risk-of-burning-out/","type":"text/html"}],"published":1385396419000,"crawled":1385396436817,"author":"tommcgowan","enclosure":[{"href":"http://i0.wp.com/i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/131125104719-lionel-messi-snell-blog-story-top.jpg?resize=120%2C68","length":28800,"type":"image/jpeg"}],"origin":{"htmlUrl":"http://worldsport.blogs.cnn.com","title":"CNN World Sport","streamId":"feed/http://rss.cnn.com/rss/edition_worldsportblog.rss"},"summary":{"content":"After nearly 400 games, and over 300 goals, is Lionel Messi suffering from burn out?

After all, last season Indiana got to within one win of the NBA Finals before succumbing to Miami in seven games.</p>\n<p>The Pacers’ hot start to this campaign has shown they are here to stay and will be hoping to overtake Miami in the East. Indiana won a team-record nine games in a row to begin the season and currently holds the NBA’s best record. Despite that, here are five reasons why they will not maintain this lightning pace:</p>\n<p>1. Misleading early schedule. Indiana’s opponents so far have been relatively weak. Their best win was arguably at home against the Chicago Bulls, while their first loss was a comprehensive beat-down at an improved Bulls team just 10 days later. The Pacers are yet to get to the meat of their schedule. Before Christmas, a lengthy road trip awaits which includes dates with Western Conference favorites San Antonio, Oklahoma City and L.A. Clippers. They also have two clashes with LeBron James and the Heat.</p>\n<p>2. Not enough killer instinct. The Pacers grind out too many wins and have a tendency of letting inferior competition hang around in games. Eight of their first ten wins were single-digit contests in the final quarter. A long and arduous 82-game season will wear any team down that doesn’t learn to step on an opponent’s throat when given the opportunity.</p>\n<p>3. Lack of elite point guard. George Hill is serviceable, but his 3.5 assists per game are not enough to facilitate the Indiana offense. Paul George and Roy Hibbert are knocking on the door of becoming elite players, but will not take the next step offensively without better service. As a team, Indiana is in the bottom third of the league when it comes to assists per game. (The Miami Heat don’t have an elite point guard, but LeBron and Dwyane Wade’s handling of the ball more than makes up for that)</p>\n<p>4. Poor play on the road. While the Pacers are very good at protecting their home court, they’re often a different prospect on the road. Last season Indiana were a losing team away from home, which cost them a shot at the Eastern Conference’s 2nd seed. Despite a better showing so far in this campaign, the lopsided loss in Chicago and the overtime win at struggling New York are causes for concern.</p>\n<p>5. Added pressure and expectations. Last season’s talk about whether the Heat could repeat and when the injured Derrick Rose would return to the Bulls allowed Indiana to fly under the radar in the East. That’s no longer a luxury for coach Frank Vogel and company, as they’ve become arguably Miami’s biggest challengers. The Pacers have plenty of experience but lack players who’ve dealt with pressure like that before.</p>\n<p>Miami will remain the league favorite until someone knocks them off their perch. Will that team be the Indiana Pacers? We’ll have a much better idea come Christmas.</p><br> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/cnniworldsport.wordpress.com/9922/\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/cnniworldsport.wordpress.com/9922/\" border=\"0\"></a> <img height=\"1\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=worldsport.blogs.cnn.com&blog=8188608&post=9922&subd=cnniworldsport&ref=&feed=1\" border=\"0\"><img height=\"1\" width=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/rss/edition_worldsportblog/~4/3mWYnOvaPg4\">","direction":"ltr"},"canonical":[{"href":"http://worldsport.blogs.cnn.com/2013/11/22/five-reasons-why-the-indiana-pacers-will-fall-away/","type":"text/html"}],"enclosure":[{"href":"http://i1.wp.com/i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/131122175606-indiana-pacers-blog-story-top.jpg?resize=120%2C68","length":28800,"type":"image/jpeg"}],"origin":{"htmlUrl":"http://worldsport.blogs.cnn.com","streamId":"feed/http://rss.cnn.com/rss/edition_worldsportblog.rss","title":"CNN World Sport"},"summary":{"content":"Coming into this season, the Indiana Pacers were naturally tabbed as one of the challengers to the Heat’s championship reign.

Even after the most epic of victories, a football-style pitch invasion on the pristinely groomed Wimbledon lawns would never, and could never happen, under any circumstances.</p>\n<p>With one exception.</p>\n<p>In July 2000, Ecuador's Davis Cup team pulled off an unlikely victory against a heavily favored British lineup on their home court. A decidedly partisan crowd was aghast as the South American players and their extensive entourage broke with tradition and stormed the court in pure jubilee.<span></span></p>\n<p>I was fortunate enough to witness the match first hand and, in all my years of watching top-flight tennis up close and personal, the passion and excitement I witnessed that day will never be surpassed. To see a team pile up on their players and dance around the court resembled more a European Champions League final victory than a tennis match.</p>\n<p>The reason for this over-the-top celebration was simple. In the Davis Cup, a player is not simply representing himself, he is representing his country, and thus the joy of victory is amplified exponentially.</p>\n<p>This sense of excitement is evident at every Davis Cup tie, where the fervent boisterous atmosphere is almost completely at odds with the &quot;silence, please&quot; feel of a traditional tennis tournament, and the sport is much the better for it.</p>\n<p>As Andre Agassi eloquently put it in his International Tennis Hall of Fame induction speech, &quot;Tennis is a lonely sport, probably the most lonely. You're out there with no team, no coach and no place to hide.&quot;</p>\n<p>As the Davis Cup has shown, this need not always be the case.</p>\n<p>Team tennis exists at every level of the game, and is far more popular than the individual version of the sport at the adult recreational level. At the competitive level, team tennis is nothing new. Intercollegiate tennis has been played in some capacity since 1883, the Davis Cup has been around since 1900 and World Team Tennis has been going strong since the 1970s.</p>\n<p>With the ever-increasing physical requirements of becoming a world-class tennis player, the opportunities to break into the top flight at a young age are becoming increasingly limited, and as such more and more aspiring young players are playing college tennis in the United States before turning pro. The best example of this John Isner, who played four years at the University of Georgia before joining the ATP Tour and subsequently reaching the top 10 in the world.</p>\n<p>Aside from the opportunity to attain an education and train for free, the lure of college tennis is largely due to the excitement of being part of a team. Being able to celebrate a victory collectively is far more rewarding than on your own. For the same reasons, more and more often pros are playing World Team Tennis after retiring, or in some cases, while they’re still on tour.</p>\n<p>Simply put, playing on a team is more fun than playing on your own. It’s also more fun to watch.</p>\n<p>The sight of Novak Djokovic and his Serbian teammates all shaving their heads on court after winning the 2010 Davis Cup, or American legends Pete Sampras, Agassi, Jim Courier and John McEnroe passing the U.S. flag from person to person for a victory lap after winning the cup in 1992, are unique to team tennis.</p>\n<div><a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/video/data/2.0/video/sports/2013/02/21/open-court-us-men-grand-slam.cnn.html\">Click to watch video</a></div>\n<p>These images are more expressive and emotive than those of many individual victors, who often must reserve their innermost excitement in order to be respectful to their opponent.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, while each Davis Cup tie is filled with passion and excitement, this momentum is quickly lost by the lengthy separation between each round, which is often as long as four or five months.</p>\n<p>Equally frustrating is the relatively short time between the final, and the following year’s first round, which is often only two or three months. This doesn’t allow the victorious team to fully enjoy the sense of winning before having to start all over again.</p>\n<p>So how can we capture the feel of Davis Cup tennis, bottle it, and develop it?</p>\n<p>One idea would be to bundle the various rounds together to create a single two-week event which would allow teams an opportunity to bond into a cohesive unit, and allow the fans to fully engage in the competition in the same manner they would for a World Cup.</p>\n<p>Considering the density of the ATP Tour calendar as it stands, the logistics of incorporating this option would highly problematic. However, there is an opportunity to do this.</p>\n<p>Every four years, the ATP Tour carves open space in its summer schedule for the Olympic Games, often between Wimbledon and the U.S. Open. This same time period could be opened up permanently, and allocated every other year for the Davis Cup, leaving a fourth year for a continental team competition, such as a European Cup.</p>\n<p>Over the course of five years, this two-week period in late July or early August would look like this: Olympic Games, Davis Cup, Continental Cup, Davis Cup, then back to the Olympics.</p>\n<p>By making the competition two weeks long, but every other year, you would increase the gravity of the competition. Equally, by having the competition at a single location, countries would have to bid for the honor of hosting. It could, essentially, become tennis’ World Cup.</p>\n<p>One ever-present argument against change is tradition. However, upon closer examination, the second Davis Cup did not take place until two years after the first, and it wasn’t until the eighth installment of the competition that ties were held at different venues at different times.</p>\n<p>So, in essence, what I’m really calling for a return to the tournament's origins. Just without wooden rackets.</p><br> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/cnniworldsport.wordpress.com/9908/\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/cnniworldsport.wordpress.com/9908/\" border=\"0\"></a> <img height=\"1\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=worldsport.blogs.cnn.com&blog=8188608&post=9908&subd=cnniworldsport&ref=&feed=1\" border=\"0\"><img height=\"1\" width=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/rss/edition_worldsportblog/~4/v6jDKZoCMSk\">","direction":"ltr"},"author":"tommcgowan","alternate":[{"href":"http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_worldsportblog/~3/v6jDKZoCMSk/","type":"text/html"}],"canonical":[{"href":"http://worldsport.blogs.cnn.com/2013/11/15/davis-cup-can-it-become-the-world-cup-of-tennis/","type":"text/html"}],"enclosure":[{"href":"http://i0.wp.com/i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/131115165040-ecuador-davis-cup-story-top.jpg?resize=120%2C68","length":28800,"type":"image/jpeg"}],"origin":{"htmlUrl":"http://worldsport.blogs.cnn.com","streamId":"feed/http://rss.cnn.com/rss/edition_worldsportblog.rss","title":"CNN World Sport"},"summary":{"content":"Keep off the Grass!

The veteran lineman claims his remarks “came from a place of love” towards his younger colleague.</p>\n<p>While the details continue to unfold, it seems they may only be making the case less and less clear to what actually happened.</p>\n<div><a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/video/data/2.0/video/sports/2013/11/13/pmt-glazer-incognito-interview.cnn.html\">Click to watch video</a></div>\n<p>However, the truth about what transpired might not be the biggest issue that the NFL and other major professional leagues will have to deal with in the aftermath.</p>\n<p>For years we’ve seen the images of NFL rookies being forced to cut their hair in ridiculous fashion, duct taped to goal posts after practice or something as simple as carrying veteran players’ shoulder pads and being ridiculed when they refuse to comply.</p>\n<p>And there lies the problem. The NFL has never addressed the issue of hazing with a set of rules.</p>\n<p>That doesn’t mean the league is ignoring the issue.</p>\n<p>In a recent press release, NFL Commissioner Rodger Goodell said, “Under league policy, all employees have the right to a workplace free of any form of harassment. We are fully committed to an appropriate working environment for all NFL personnel.”</p>\n<p>While Incognito’s actions will likely violate the NFL's Personal Conduct Policy under the umbrella of “Violent or threatening behavior among employees, whether in or outside the workplace” and “conduct that undermines or puts at risk the integrity and reputation of the NFL, NFL clubs or NFL players”, there’s nothing specifically designated from the league that deals specifically with hazing or bullying.</p>\n<p>Typically coaches will mandate how the culture of their locker room operates.</p>\n<p>Former NFL head coach Tony Dungy, who led the Indianapolis Colts to a Super Bowl victory in 2006, and Andy Reid, who currently has the Kansas City Chiefs off to a league best 9-0 start, are two examples of successful coaches that changed the “traditional” NFL locker room and implemented strict “no hazing” policies.</p>\n<p>The culture of the NFL isn’t one that is open to “soft” players.</p>\n<p>At its very core the team with the bigger, stronger players will succeed in most instances, so the need for “toughening up” players is obvious with such high stakes.</p>\n<p>While any professional sports locker room is a far cry from the standard workplace for most citizens, it’s still just that: a workplace.</p>\n<p>And let’s be honest, you’ll be hard-pressed to find a billion dollar business that lets its employees be hazed in any fashion.</p>\n<p>Possibly the biggest problem the Dolphins are facing isn’t that this was potentially another case of locker room mistreatment from one player to another, but it has reportedly involved figures from the general manager condoning Martin punching his teammate in the nose, to the coaching staff encouraging Incognito to “toughen up” the young player.</p>\n<p>While the details aren’t clear as to what actually went on over the past year between Martin and Incognito - whether it was bullying, racism, hazing or details taken out of context - one thing is clear: it was standard procedure in an NFL locker room, and that’s about to change.</p><br> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/cnniworldsport.wordpress.com/9903/\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/cnniworldsport.wordpress.com/9903/\" border=\"0\"></a> <img height=\"1\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=worldsport.blogs.cnn.com&blog=8188608&post=9903&subd=cnniworldsport&ref=&feed=1\" border=\"0\"><img height=\"1\" width=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/rss/edition_worldsportblog/~4/p1NpiSqAqEo\">","direction":"ltr"},"author":"jsinnottcnn","alternate":[{"href":"http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_worldsportblog/~3/p1NpiSqAqEo/","type":"text/html"}],"published":1384361847000,"crawled":1384361873361,"updated":1384361847000,"canonical":[{"href":"http://worldsport.blogs.cnn.com/2013/11/13/bullying-in-the-nfl-problem-or-part-of-the-game/","type":"text/html"}],"title":"Bullying in the NFL: Problem or part of the game?","summary":{"content":"Miami is the center of an NFL media storm, and it’s not because the storied franchise is in the hunt to make their first playoff appearance since 2008.

Tournaments are unpredictable, players fall out of form or they can get injured. Federer needs things to go his way.</p>\n<p>Wimbledon, where he has won a record-equaling seven men’s singles titles, is his best chance of a record 18th grand slam.</p>\n<p>He crashed out in the second round at the All England Club this year - losing in four sets to Ukrainian Sergiy Stakhovsky - but I don’t think he played badly in that match. </p>\n<p>Federer ran into a red-hot player and Stakhovsky played the match of his life.</p>\n<p>Regardless, Federer is still a real threat. I don’t think any player would like to face an in-form Federer in a quarterfinal or a semifinal. </p>\n<p>I don’t think Nadal or Djokovic would be too happy about seeing him in their side of the draw.</p>\n<p>If either of those two has been in a five-set match and they see a fresh Federer in the semifinals or a final, that’s a pretty frightening proposition.</p>\n<p>As for Nadal, he missed three months of the year and ended up as No. 1. That’s quite something. </p>\n<p>Despite losing to Djokovic at the ATP World Tour Finals, he’s the man to beat in 2014.</p>\n<p>At times this season, the Spaniard has played as well as he ever has. </p>\n<p>The U.S. Open, where he beat Djokovic to clinch a 14th grand slam triumph, was particularly spectacular. </p>\n<p>The French Open wasn’t his best, but he still took the title; his eighth at Roland Garros. His comeback from knee injuries has been the story of the year.</p>\n<p>Djokovic has certainly been the most consistent player over the past couple of years, getting to world No. 1 prior to Nadal’s return to form.</p>\n<p>It's crucial to see who can stay fittest for the longest. Remember three of the top four players have had injuries this year.</p>\n<p>One of which is Murray, who missed the World Tour Finals with a back injury. If the two-time grand slam winner is fully fit he’s a real threat.</p>\n<p>His success at Wimbledon was one of the highlights of the year with Murray becoming the first British men’s singles champion at SW19 for 77 years by beating Djokovic in straight sets.</p>\n<p>Outside the usual suspects, Juan Martin Del Potro is the player to watch. </p>\n<p>The Argentine looked good this year.

It’s only a matter of life or death for one of them. </p>\n<p>But in the United States, professional athletes and soldiers are increasingly sharing common ground and it’s not just because they’re all &quot;in uniform.&quot;<span></span></p>\n<p>Support for the military was one of the biggest differences I observed when I moved from London to Atlanta last year. </p>\n<p>In the U.S., it’s everywhere you look: the television network NBC is running a prominent campaign, “I’ve got your six” - which means I've got your back covered - shops and insurance companies provide discounts for veterans and my seven-year-old children have just written to soldiers for a school project. </p>\n<p>It’s through sport that I’m most cognizant of the military though. It’s hard to miss the marching bands, the flybys and returning veterans being saluted or applauded at packed stadiums.</p>\n<p>At key times like Veterans and Memorial Day you can expect to see star players like Lebron James taking to the airwaves to express their gratitude for the sacrifice. </p>\n<p>Televised college games are played on aircraft carriers, UFC events are held at airbases and all of the main professional leagues actively raise funds for veterans’ hospitals and charities. </p>\n<p>In Britain, the national anthem is sung only at national sporting events but in the U.S. you’ll hear &quot;The Star Spangled Banner&quot; before every football, baseball, basketball and hockey game. </p>\n<p>After the devastating terror attacks on 9/11, the patriotic hymn &quot;America the Beautiful&quot; is also now sung during baseball games. </p>\n<div><a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/video/data/2.0/video/world/2013/10/16/bosnia-world-cup-amanpour.cnn.html\">Click to watch video</a></div>\n<p>It can feel a bit awkward if you are a foreigner, mumbling along to the words, unsure of where to put your hands, while everyone else has theirs proudly planted against their chests.</p>\n<p>There is a sense that since the 9/11 attacks, sport has been more closely entwined with the major sports in the U.S.</p>\n<p>This is a country where roughly 15% of the population has experience of serving in the military and 97% is directly connected to someone who has served - involvement in two world wars, Korea and Vietnam has created millions of vets and thousands more have been made in Iraq and Afghanistan.</p>\n<p>Sports organizations say that their arenas are the ideal place to recognize the troops’ commitment and sacrifice. Games represent community congregations numbering in the tens of thousands - millions more are watching on TV and saying thanks is the &quot;the right thing to do.&quot; </p>\n<p>But is there more to it than that? Sports marketing expert Kevin Adler says that professional athletic organizations, or any other corporate entities for that matter, aren’t in the do-the-right-thing business. The altruism is ultimately self-serving. </p>\n<p>He told me: “they’ve tapped into the zeitgeist of supporting and appreciating the military and used that as a marketing platform, but it's not wrong if it raises awareness and promotes engagement around that cause.” </p>\n<p>It’s a far cry from the previous generation, when troops returning from Vietnam were treated appallingly and shunned.</p>\n<p>All wars are political but the people most affected by them are usually those with the least say in the matter.</p>\n<p>The difference between now and Vietnam is that people can recognize that; wearing a uniform doesn’t mean you agree with the mission. </p>\n<p>Next year marks the 100th anniversary of the start of World War I and the Tour de France bike race will visit the scene of some of the most brutal fighting. </p>\n<p>An estimated 900,000 casualties were sustained by German and Allied forces at Ypres and what is now a relatively sleepy French town will host the fifth stage of the 2014 event. </p>\n<p>Ypres also hosts an Under-12 football tournament to commemorate &quot;The Christmas Truce.&quot;</p>\n<p>Legend has it that in 1914, warring forces silenced their guns to kick a ball around between the trenches - now the English Premier League promotes the event to honor the sacrifice made by previous generations of footballers. </p>\n<p>In Britain, the relationship between sport and the military isn’t as obvious as it in the U.S., but things are changing. </p>\n<p>The &quot;Help for Heroes&quot; charity, which was established in 2007, has drastically changed British attitudes towards servicemen and women wounded in Iraq and Afghanistan. </p>\n<p>Specially arranged rugby matches featuring some of the world’s most legendary players have raised millions of dollars and retired footballers have done the same playing for the Heroes Cup. </p>\n<p>Serving troops and wounded veterans can now benefit from the &quot;Tickets for Troops&quot; organization which provides complimentary access to major events. Around 70% of the tickets available are for sporting events, donated by the top teams in the land.</p>\n<p>British sport and the nation's armed forces are never more closely linked than this time each year, with sporting events marking Remembrance weekend with moments of silence and the laying of wreaths.</p>\n<p>Remembrance Day, an annual day dedicated to those Commonwealth soldiers who have died in service, falls on November 11 each year, marking the end of First World War hostilities in 1918 on the 11th day of the 11th month at 11 a.m.</p>\n<p>The occasion is marked by millions with the wearing of poppies, although controversy raged when football's world governing body FIFA prohibited the England team from displaying an embroidered poppy on its shirt during a match against Spain in 2011.</p>\n<p>FIFA eventually lifted its ban following a plea from the British government, but an earlier statement from the Swiss-based body warned that allowing the wearing of poppies would<br>\n&quot;open the door to similar initiatives from all over the world, jeopardizing the neutrality of football.&quot;</p>\n<p>While some might see the close relationship between sport and the military as an important way of supporting troops, FIFA's words raise the question, can these links be too close for comfort.</p>\n<p>It has also been suggested to me that these very public shows of support for the armed forces are more for the benefit and conscience of the sports fans in the arenas than the troops they are supposed to be honoring.</p><br> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/cnniworldsport.wordpress.com/9884/\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/cnniworldsport.wordpress.com/9884/\" border=\"0\"></a> <img height=\"1\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=worldsport.blogs.cnn.com&blog=8188608&post=9884&subd=cnniworldsport&ref=&feed=1\" border=\"0\"><img height=\"1\" width=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/rss/edition_worldsportblog/~4/rMis_uZUr6U\">","direction":"ltr"},"alternate":[{"href":"http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_worldsportblog/~3/rMis_uZUr6U/","type":"text/html"}],"canonical":[{"href":"http://worldsport.blogs.cnn.com/2013/11/11/we-will-remember-them-but-should-sport/","type":"text/html"}],"author":"tommcgowan","crawled":1384181370116,"title":"We will remember them, but should sport?","summary":{"content":"Gaining territory, a tactical advantage, physical combat, winners and losers.

They are clubs that are owned by people that deeply appreciate and understand the value of analytics.”</p>\n<p>Written with behavioral economist David Sally, &quot;The Numbers Game&quot; is chock-a-bloc with statistical nuggets - such as that players in the five big European leagues who come from countries with high levels of civil conflict receive far more yellow and red cards than those from more stable nations, or that corners have practically no effect on results.</p>\n<p>Former Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson has often talked about the huge advances that were made in sport science within football while he was at Old Trafford over more than two decades.</p>\n<p>Key here was the general acceptance that your team needed to be fit to succeed. It was easy to measure players’ improvement in fitness and just as importantly managers were able to understand what the sports scientists were telling them.</p>\n<p>Buying and selling players using analytics is different. How do you do that cheaply and efficiently and ultimately improve performance on the pitch?</p>\n<p>Crucially, is football willing to open its arms to people that potentially might have the skills - we are talking about people with Ph.Ds here - to successfully analyze data, but are unlikely to come from a non-playing background?</p>\n<p>“Generally you end up working within the football industry typically because you love football or you have played football,” said Anderson, who was speaking to CNN at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://theinnovationenterprise.com/summits/elite-minds-london-2013\">the Elite Minds in Sports conference at Arsenal’s Emirates Stadium on Tuesday.</a></p>\n<p>“The way football clubs are organized, there is a real territoriality about who gets to make decisions and have input as to which players they have and what kind of football the teams play.”</p>\n<p>Anderson was speaking on a panel with Everton’s head of technical scouting James Smith, and both made the point that football clubs arguably might do better to ditch the 25th man of their squad and spend that player’s wages on analytics.</p>\n<p>Everton’s performance analysis budget –- to look at its own players as well as the opposition - is currently between £150,000 ($240,000) and £200,000 ($320,000), but Smith argues that just another £50,000 ($80,000) spent on analytics would allow the Premier League club to be much more thorough in its approach.</p>\n<p>Smith happily admits that this is virgin territory for most clubs: &quot;We do more GCSE (high school) maths stuff - averages, bar charts etc. - when it comes to player analysis, but that will change.”</p>\n<p>He has even been in touch with five or six Everton bloggers who are interested in statistical analysis - “they were very impressive,” says Smith – to see what the club can learn from them.</p>\n<p>“Bloggers need to find metrics that are so compelling that the critics can’t say no.”</p>\n<p>Despite the resistance to analytics, both as regards performance analysis and buying players, Anderson believes football is slowly changing.</p>\n<p>“Smart scouting departments are starting to organize themselves more professionally in the way they collect and store information than the way traditional scouts have done,&quot; he says.</p>\n<p>“Rationalization, standardization and professionalization is happening at the bigger clubs, but it’s always linked to resources – it takes hardware, software and manpower to accomplish this.</p>\n<p>“The bigger clubs have more at stake in that the player investments they make are bigger and they want to minimize risk. Conversely smaller clubs have more to gain if they invest in these tools.”</p>\n<p>So with the January transfer window on the horizon, who would Anderson be looking to sign?</p>\n<p>“Look at the defensive behavior of all players on the field –- that includes the No. 10 and the winger as well as the center back,” advises Anderson. “There’s a huge inefficiency in the market of understanding and evaluating the defensive performance of players.”</p>\n<p>Anderson said he has recently been in email contact with Billy Beane, the general manager of major league baseball team Oakland Athletics, who was the focus of Michael Lewis' 2003 book &quot;Moneyball&quot; about the importance of identifying a team’s weakest line.</p>\n<p>“Look to manage from the bottom up,” said Anderson. “How can you improve the average level of skill of your team? Remember it’s a lot cheaper and a lot less risky to improve the weakest than the strongest player.”</p>\n<p>It sounds like perfect commonsense. Which begs the question – just when we will see a professor of politics as a director of football at a major European club?</p>\n<p>“Hopefully soon,” smiles Anderson. “Within the next two or three years.

No bad matches</strong><br>\nOnly the top eight players in the world qualify for the World Tour Finals, therefore every single match squares off two players who are at the very least grand slam semifinal caliber players. </p>\n<p>There’s no risk of seeing a no-namer blown out in the first round by an elite player who never has to change out of second gear. Every single match pits the best players in the world against each other. </p>\n<p>Some of this year’s first round matches include Roger Federer against Novak Djokovic and a replay of the French Open final between Rafael Nadal and David Ferrer.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Round-robin format</strong><br>\nUnlike the rest of the year, the ATP World Tour Finals splits the players into two round-robin groups of four, with the top two from each qualifying for the semifinals. This allows for players to lose one match, recover, regroup and potentially advance to the next round. This ensures the players in the latter stages of the tournament are the ones peaking at its conclusion, rather than the beginning. It also allows a player to have an off day and not exit the tournament. </p>\n<p>On the five occasions that Pete Sampras claimed the title, 'Pistol Pete' never once ended the tournament undefeated. In fact, on three occasions he won the final against the very player who had beaten him in the group stage - twice over Boris Becker, and once over Andre Agassi.</p>\n<div><a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/video/data/2.0/video/sports/2013/10/18/spc-open-court-stan-wawrinka.cnn.html\">Click to watch video</a></div>\n<p><strong>3. Indoor courts</strong><br>\nWithout interference from the elements, the fans attending are assured of seeing the matches on the billboard without rain delay. Equally, the lack of wind or extreme temperatures guarantees the highest level of tennis on the court.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Fast courts</strong><br>\nIndoor courts tend to play faster, allowing for more varied styles of play which include the almost-extinct serve-and-volley game, unseen throughout most of the year. </p>\n<p>This can, however, be detrimental to players like world No. 1 Nadal, who is yet to win the title.</p>\n<p><strong>5. You can watch every match</strong><br>\nWith every match taking place on a single court, fans could conceivably watch every single point of the tournament without having to purchase an expensive television package or miss out on any sleep.</p>\n<p><strong>6. Everyone has to qualify</strong><br>\nThe ATP World Tour Finals is the only event where no wildcards are offered into the draw, and no player is assured a place by virtue of being healthy and available. Every player on tour starts the season on a level playing field and has to earn their spot in the elite eight-man draw. This is not lost on the players who often cite qualification for the tournament as their goal heading into the season.</p>\n<div><a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/video/data/2.0/video/sports/2013/10/17/spc-open-court-david-ferrer.cnn.html\">Click to watch video</a></div>\n<p><strong>7. Pomp and ceremony</strong><br>\nRarely are the best players of any sport gathered together in one place, dressed up in matching suits and presented to the heads of state. Even the most jaded anti-establishment among us cannot help but enjoy seeing our heroes, outside their element, dressed up to the nines and on their best behavior.</p>\n<p><strong>8. Technological experience</strong><br>\nWith the event being indoors, in a climate controlled arena, the opportunity to create a dynamic, energetic, technologically modern experience is not taken lightly by the hosts of the event. Every resource is used to create a rock concert atmosphere, with great music, pyrotechnics and lasers a plenty.</p>\n<p><strong>9. Year-end world No. 1 ranking on the line</strong><br>\nAlthough world rankings are released every week, finishing the year as the top ranked player in the world carries a far greater weight. With a ton of ranking points on the line and only a negligible amount of Davis Cup points available afterwards, this is the last chance to ensure that the you will go down in the record books as the best tennis player in the world for the year. </p>\n<p>This year tournament will see Nadal and Djokovic battle it out down the home stretch to see who goes down as the best player of 2013.</p>\n<p>And one reason why it used to be even better...</p>\n<p><strong>The custom singles court</strong>(Getty Images)<br>\n<a href=\"http://cnniworldsport.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/1041761.jpg\"><img height=\"206\" alt=\"EXPO 2000 GV\" width=\"300\" src=\"http://cnniworldsport.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/1041761.jpg?w=300&h=206\"></a></p>\n<p>For many years, the ATP World Tour Finals was played on a custom singles court with no doubles alleys. This unique skinny look gave the event a cool feel, unlike that of any other tournament in the world. </p>\n<p>By playing on a court that was unavailable and inaccessible to any other player in the world, it highlighted the elite status of the few who were granted access to play on it. </p>\n<p>Since the addition of doubles to the event in 2000, however, the tournament has been played on a regular court. </p>\n<p>As much as I love doubles, and fully believe that adding the best eight doubles teams in the world to the event adds more entertainment value than is lost by removing the novelty of the custom court, I can’t help but miss that peculiar-looking skinny court.</p><br> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/cnniworldsport.wordpress.com/9854/\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/cnniworldsport.wordpress.com/9854/\" border=\"0\"></a> <img height=\"1\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=worldsport.blogs.cnn.com&blog=8188608&post=9854&subd=cnniworldsport&ref=&feed=1\" border=\"0\"><img height=\"1\" width=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/rss/edition_worldsportblog/~4/dHF7ky3RXuc\">","direction":"ltr"},"canonical":[{"href":"http://worldsport.blogs.cnn.com/2013/11/04/nine-reasons-the-atp-world-tour-finals-is-the-best-tournament-of-the-year/","type":"text/html"}],"enclosure":[{"href":"http://i2.wp.com/i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/131104104810-novak-djokovic-wtf-2012-story-top.jpg?resize=120%2C68","length":28800,"type":"image/jpeg"}],"origin":{"htmlUrl":"http://worldsport.blogs.cnn.com","streamId":"feed/http://rss.cnn.com/rss/edition_worldsportblog.rss","title":"CNN World Sport"},"summary":{"content":"While the Australian Open embodies the spirit of a brand new season, Roland Garros has the charm of Paris in the springtime, Wimbledon has all the history and traditionand the U.S. Open has the rowdy New York crowd, for me, as a tennis fan, nothing compares to the ATP World Tour Finals.

Usually the spotlight shines on a few teams who are deemed favourites at this time of year, but this season is different.</p>\n<p>It seems that everywhere you look, there’s a team (or player) with a point to prove in the 2013-14 campaign:</p>\n<p>In South Beach <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/video/data/2.0/video/sports/2013/10/26/unguarded-nichols-lebron-intv.cnn.html\">LeBron James</a> and company want to prove they can join the all-time greats by winning a third straight title for the Miami Heat. After all, when you say three-peat, you think of the Shaq – Kobe LA Lakers and the Jordan – Pippen Chicago Bulls. Make no mistake that James is yearning to join that elite list and seems to have the team to deliver.<span></span></p>\n<p>Derrick Rose of the Bulls is keen to show he is back to his best after missing all of last season with an injured knee. The NBA's 2011 MVP is convinced he is more explosive now and Chicago fans can only hope he’s right if they want their team to challenge Miami in the Eastern Conference (a geographical separation of the teams according to their proximity to either coast).</p>\n<p>The plucky Indiana Pacers pushed the Heat to a seventh game in the Eastern Conference Finals so this year is all about demonstrating they have the class to challenge again. They get an instant boost with former All-Star Danny Granger set to return after injury forced him to miss all but five games last season.</p>\n<p>Paul Pierce and Kevin Garnett are eager to declare they're not too old to help Brooklyn back into the big time. The veteran All-Stars were involved in one of the surprise moves this offseason as they were traded from the Boston Celtics to the Nets.</p>\n<div><a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/video/data/2.0/video/international/2013/10/25/spc-talk-asia-jeremy-lin-a.cnn.html\">Click to watch video</a></div>\n<p>Moving west, and the San Antonio Spurs want to prove they’re more than capable of getting back to the Finals after coming agonizingly close to the title back in June. Tim Duncan and Manu Ginobili may be 37 and 36 respectively, but Tony Parker is in his prime and 22-year-old Kawhi Leonard is an emerging star. The steady coaching of Gregg Popovich is a valuable asset to often underplayed.</p>\n<p>Kevin Durant and Oklahoma City are out to attest Russell Westbrook’s injury early in the playoffs was the only reason it was the Spurs and not them battling Miami in the Finals. Arguably the NBA’s best duo will be back in action when Westbrook makes his return to the Thunder in the next few months and eases the pressure off Durant.</p>\n<p>Dwight Howard feels he made the right choice in leaving the Lakers for the Rockets. The big man will be hoping to thrive in Houston and can become a crowd favourite in what is his third team in the past 14 months. The jury remains out at the moment.</p>\n<div><a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/video/data/2.0/video/international/2013/10/25/spc-talk-asia-jeremy-lin-c.cnn.html\">Click to watch video</a></div>\n<p>Howard’s former teammate Kobe Bryant is expected to return from last season’s devastating Achilles injury hoping to lead the Lakers into the playoffs in what is a loaded Western Conference. This would surely be a major accomplishment for the five-time champion given the context and the relative strength of city rivals the Clippers.</p>\n<p>New coach Doc Rivers took another step in reminding who’s the town's top dog when he vowed to cover the Lakers’ championship banners during Clippers games - the two teams share the same arena.</p>\n<p>Any way you slice it, there’s plenty of intrigue coming from all corners of the league. Whether the Miami Heat claim another title or King James is dethroned at season’s end, the point is that it’s a great time to be an NBA fan. Time to sit back and enjoy one of the world's greatest franchises get rolling again!</p>\n<br> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/cnniworldsport.wordpress.com/9832/\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/cnniworldsport.wordpress.com/9832/\" border=\"0\"></a> <img height=\"1\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=worldsport.blogs.cnn.com&blog=8188608&post=9832&subd=cnniworldsport&ref=&feed=1\" border=\"0\"><img height=\"1\" width=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/rss/edition_worldsportblog/~4/VisbhRzve24\">","direction":"ltr"},"published":1383066139000,"title":"The NBA lowdown: Who'll be top after tip-off?","summary":{"content":"The 2013-14 NBA season is finally upon us and it’s hard to recall any in recent memory that have so many sub-plots and stories gestating from coast to coast.

I'm not blaming them.&quot;</p>\n<p>How sad that a man of just 26, who possesses era-defining talent and a history-making record of achievement should have to contend with such negativism.</p>\n<p>For any in doubt, Vettel’s numbers should help illuminate.</p>\n<p>Of 117 grand prix, Vettel has finished on the podium in nearly 70% of his races, 42% as the man at the top. Schumacher’s win rate was 29% and Prost’s 26%, only the master Fangio is better at 47% .</p>\n<p>That’s a staggering rate of return given that Vettel, unlike Lewis Hamilton for example, did not begin his career in a car capable of winning (after stints with BMW Sauber and then Torro Rosso.)</p>\n<p>Who knows how many titles Ayrton Senna would have secured if his life had not been cut so tragically short. Happily for Vettel, the peak of his driving career lies ahead of him.</p>\n<p>Critics often point to the Red Bull being technically far in advance of any other car on the grid, but how often has Mark Webber delivered with much the same equipment?</p>\n<p>How many times has Webber withstood the pressure of the fading qualifying window to perfect a lap time for pole, or stretched the performance of his tires to get an edge on his rivals?</p>\n<p>How many others have remained as cool when leading the field or negotiated the chaos of the first corner to emerge unscathed?</p>\n<p>Vettel has delivered time and time again this season and when Red Bull design genius Adrian Newey - who has previously worked with Nigel Mansell, Ayrton Senna and Mika Hakkinen - says his charge has no chinks left in his armour you better believe him.</p>\n<p>Mansell, who spoke to me at <a href=\"http://www.themansellcollection.co.uk/\">his recently opened museum</a>, agreed with the appraisal: “Sebastian is a class act. He made mistakes three or four years ago, when he won his first world championship. He doesn't really make mistakes [anymore], he makes the right decisions at the right time.</p>\n<p>“He is very good at getting everybody behind him, he's super cool now, under extreme pressure at times. And he knows what he can do and he knows exactly what the opposition can do before it happens so, he's a step ahead.</p>\n<p>“I feel he deserves the accolade in the present crop of drivers and cars and everything else, he's the best there is. And that's not just because I'm a fan of his and I think I am a fan of his.  I think that is not correct that he's getting booed.”</p>\n<p>The ability to get the team working for you as a driver is an underplayed skill in Formula One, and one that British Formula One broadcaster Murray Walker argues has been a key attribute of Vettel.</p>\n<p>“He's an absolutely brilliant driver and he's got enormous talent in making the team work for him rather than his teammate which is something Michael Schumacher and Ayrton Senna were both very good at,” Walker told CNN.</p>\n<p>Driving skill and team politics aside, how many other drivers have remained on such good terms with so many other pilots on the grid when dominating them?</p>\n<p>Ferrari rival Fernando Alonso heartily congratulated Vettel on his title win as did Hamilton, who even suggested the German was on his way to becoming the “greatest in F1”. Lotus driver Romain Grosjean revealed to CNN a side to Vettel that Red Bull team principal Christian Horner often talks about but is not always seen.</p>\n<p>“He is quite funny.  Every time we are together on the podium, we have a good laugh and we like to share jokes.  I can understand German when he speaks German, he can understand French when I speak French so we always joke about it and he's a nice young man,” Grosjean said.</p>\n<p>Vettel is erudite, mature beyond his years, prodigiously skilled and private and humble in comparison to many of his contemporaries in the world of elite sporting athletes.</p>\n<p>Already he has a decent claim to be the greatest ever and this will surely only strengthen over time. Is it his fault that there are no rivals strong enough to test him fully?</p>\n<br> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/cnniworldsport.wordpress.com/9837/\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/cnniworldsport.wordpress.com/9837/\" border=\"0\"></a> <img height=\"1\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=worldsport.blogs.cnn.com&blog=8188608&post=9837&subd=cnniworldsport&ref=&feed=1\" border=\"0\"><img height=\"1\" width=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/rss/edition_worldsportblog/~4/USmp1JOR8zk\">","direction":"ltr"},"published":1382983425000,"title":"Is Sebastian Vettel Formula One's greatest?","author":"CNNi blog producer","crawled":1382983449358,"summary":{"content":"There aren’t many four-time Formula One world champions to speak of.

The United States is the land of opportunity, and on the basketball courts and the playing fields here it represents an opportunity to freeze the clock and make the action last quite a bit longer.</p>\n<p>I love most sports, and the ballgames across the pond from my native Britain are no different. But I do so wish they’d hurry up. Football – the one they play with their hands – lasts exactly 60 minutes on the clock but it takes over three hours from start to finish. Basketball is a game of four equal quarters and it should take just 48 minutes, but an average NBA contest lasts three times that – two hours and a quarter.<span></span></p>\n<p>Only baseball is different – the &quot;national pastime&quot; doesn’t need a timekeeper because it marches to the beat of its own drum. As your Dad may well have barked at you on those long car journeys as a child, “We’ll get there when we get there!” Nine innings of three outs each will take as long as it takes, but for the record it could be three hours – unless they need extra innings and unless it’s the playoffs, when every sport takes even longer.</p>\n<p>It didn’t use to be this way. Back in the 1970s and early ‘80s, NBA games were broadcast on tape delay, but things changed when they were shown live on television. Timeouts were already a part of the game, but a bunch of mandatory stoppages were introduced to enable even more commercial breaks.</p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://worldsport.blogs.cnn.com/2013/10/23/washington-redskins-racist-or-a-sporting-exception/\">Read: Washington Redskins – Racist or sporting exception?</a></p>\n<p>I asked the NBA to explain them all to me but the length, volume and variety of these timeouts was too confusing to comprehend and many dedicated basketball fans don’t even get what they’re all for and why they’re taken. But what is clear is that in a tight game the number of stoppages can make the last two minutes of playing time go on for 20. I’m not joking.</p>\n<p>My father-in-law is a lifelong New York Giants fan, yet he’d never been to see a game in person. He was an armchair fan and, for large parts of his life, a long-suffering one. A few years ago I took him to Giants Stadium because I assumed that he’d want to see a real game once in his lifetime, but I quickly realized that he was only humoring me.</p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://worldsport.blogs.cnn.com/2013/09/26/the-naked-truth-how-close-is-too-close/\">Read: The Naked Truth – How close is too close?</a></p>\n<p>On the drive across the Hudson River he laid out how these games have become made for TV – domestic viewers are distracted during the breaks by the analysis, the commercials, a spot of channel-hopping or the beer in the fridge. But at the stadium, there’s not much to do except wait.</p>\n<p>It’s all very new to me. Growing up in Britain, I was raised on a diet of football – the game you play with your foot – which lasts an hour and a half. It’s two frenetic halves of 45 minutes and there’s no stadium clock. The only man really keeping count is the referee in the middle, and his watch never stops ticking. It doesn’t matter if the ball goes out of play or if there’s an injury, the flow of the game is largely uninterrupted and if necessary he just adds a bit more on at the end. Looking at it from a new perspective, it feels rather quaint. But it’s not perfect.</p>\n<p>Take the legendary Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson, who wasn’t just a master tactician and motivator but also a renowned manipulator of the big and little hands. His reputation was such that he could bend time as well as Salvador Dali could clocks.</p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2013/10/22/sport/football/alex-ferguson-my-autobiography-rooney-football/index.html\">Read: Ferguson reveals all in new book</a></p>\n<p>Since injury time – additional time at the end of a game – is subjective and discretionary, it always felt as if his teams were given a bit more time when they were chasing the game at home. It was such a phenomenon that it even got its own name: &quot;Fergie time.&quot;</p>\n<p>Statistical analysis has shown that it’s not just Manchester United who benefit from Old Father Time when they need it. Generally big teams playing at home are likely to profit in such a way – referees such as Graham Poll have admitted that it’s easy to be influenced by the demands of the crowd.</p>\n<p>Such situations inevitably lead to criticism of the referees when goals are scored deep into these additional periods, something that could never happen in American sports. In NFL stadiums, a massive stadium clock takes the guesswork out it and as long as you don’t mind all the interruptions for injuries, changes of possession and – of course – timeouts, then everyone knows where they stand.</p>\n<p>Time waits for no man, so they say. It’s also known as an abstract concept and its abstraction can drive you to distraction. I guess it’s simply a case of what you’re used to.</p>\n<br> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/cnniworldsport.wordpress.com/9814/\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/cnniworldsport.wordpress.com/9814/\" border=\"0\"></a> <img height=\"1\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=worldsport.blogs.cnn.com&blog=8188608&post=9814&subd=cnniworldsport&ref=&feed=1\" border=\"0\"><img height=\"1\" width=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/rss/edition_worldsportblog/~4/7VMXbMdDKBY\">","direction":"ltr"},"published":1382619395000,"title":"Why the clocks never go back in U.S. Sport","updated":1382622995000,"alternate":[{"href":"http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_worldsportblog/~3/7VMXbMdDKBY/","type":"text/html"}],"canonical":[{"href":"http://worldsport.blogs.cnn.com/2013/10/24/why-the-clocks-never-go-back-in-u-s-sport/","type":"text/html"}],"enclosure":[{"href":"http://i0.wp.com/i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/131023171732-lebron-wade-and-bosh-story-top.jpg?resize=120%2C68","length":28800,"type":"image/jpeg"}],"origin":{"htmlUrl":"http://worldsport.blogs.cnn.com","title":"CNN World Sport","streamId":"feed/http://rss.cnn.com/rss/edition_worldsportblog.rss"},"summary":{"content":"They say that &quot;time waits for no man&quot; – except perhaps if you’re a fan of American sports.

When the football team moved to the capital four years later, they brought the name with them and have held it ever since.<span></span></p>\n<p>“Redskin” is a slang term used to describe Native Americans, and is defined by the Merriam-Webster dictionary as a term “usually offensive” except when in reference to Washington’s NFL franchise.</p>\n<p>Recently, the Redskins owner, Bill Snyder <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2013/10/09/us/washington-redskins-name/index.html\">sent a letter to the team’s season ticket-holders and the “Washington Redskins Nation” defending the decision to continue using the name.</a></p>\n<p>Throughout Snyder’s letter, the owner references a number of studies that show Native Americans don’t find the team’s name offensive, and that the general public doesn’t think it should be changed. Snyder’s letter points to the team’s origins with Native Americans and its respect for their traditions.</p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://worldsport.blogs.cnn.com/2013/09/02/american-college-football-faces-up-to-the-pressures-of-professionalism/\">Read: College football faces up to professionalism</a></p>\n<p>But the fight over Native American mascots doesn’t stop there. Teams in Major League Baseball, and primarily collegiate athletics programs, have also received backlash for their nicknames.</p>\n<p>Two MLB clubs, the Atlanta Braves and Cleveland Indians, changed their logos to become less offensive to Native Americans. The Braves replaced their mascot “Chief Noc-A-Homa” - though they still use the “Screaming Indian” on some of their uniforms and apparel. This year, the Indians replaced their logo of “Chief Wahoo” on team caps and batting helmets, but it still appears on uniform sleeves.</p>\n<div><a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/video/data/2.0/video/bestoftv/2013/10/18/xfire-redskins-name-real-problems.cnn.html\">Click to watch video</a></div>\n<p>In 2005, the NCAA cited 31 colleges for having mascots that use potentially offensive imagery. Since then, all universities previously using the nickname Indians have been forced to change their mascot. Other nicknames like Savages, Braves, Redmen and anything referring to a specific tribe, like Seminoles or Sioux, are also included in the citation.</p>\n<p>Some schools chose to make a complete change and go a different direction. For instance, Arkansas State changed from the Indians to the Red Wolves. Other major universities like the University of Illinois’ mascot, the Illini, has only had its image changed, since the mascot refers to the state as a whole.</p>\n<p>Overall, 15 teams have changed their mascot to be more sensitive to Native Americans, but there are four teams who fall into this category, but haven’t changed anything. The Florida State Seminoles, Central Michigan Chippewas, Utah Utes and Mississippi College Choctaws have all been granted waivers to keep their nicknames after the respective tribes gave their support to the schools.</p>\n<p>So if teams with nicknames that aren’t deemed racist have made the change, how has Washington been able to maintain its much more controversial title and mascot?</p>\n<p>While legal action has been taken to force the team to change its nickname, the responsibility lies with the team’s owner. Snyder claims the franchise’s continued use of the name is a matter of tradition and pride, while continually ignoring the fact that it can be taken as a racist term.</p>\n<p>Regardless of what polls and the general public say, refusing to admit that the team’s name is a problem negates what Jackie Robinson did so many years ago to take racism out of sports as a whole.</p>\n<br> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/cnniworldsport.wordpress.com/9807/\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/cnniworldsport.wordpress.com/9807/\" border=\"0\"></a> <img height=\"1\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=worldsport.blogs.cnn.com&blog=8188608&post=9807&subd=cnniworldsport&ref=&feed=1\" border=\"0\"><img height=\"1\" width=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/rss/edition_worldsportblog/~4/0o3by9-CvCI\">","direction":"ltr"},"alternate":[{"href":"http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_worldsportblog/~3/0o3by9-CvCI/","type":"text/html"}],"canonical":[{"href":"http://worldsport.blogs.cnn.com/2013/10/23/washington-redskins-racist-or-a-sporting-exception/","type":"text/html"}],"published":1382538908000,"crawled":1382538936927,"author":"garymorley","title":"Washington Redskins: Racist or a sporting exception?","summary":{"content":"In 1947, Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier in American sport when he took the field for the Brooklyn Dodgers as the first African American to play in the formerly all-white baseball league.

This after all is the team with its very own science establishment - the MilanLab - which it describes as a “high tech interdisciplinary scientific research center” to provide “the best possible management of individual well being and health” for its players.<span></span></p>\n<p>That attention to detail scuppered <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2009/06/18/soccer-italy-milan-cissokho-idUKB89812520090618\">the transfer of French left-back Aly Cissokho, who is now at Liverpool, from Porto to AC Milan in 2009 over a dental problem.</a></p>\n<p>Belgium's youth policy has developed a new generation of players now excelling in leagues all over Europe, which may have played a part in Milan's interest in Riga and Bruyninckx.</p>\n<p>“The fact our national team selects players that have been trained with our concept and got to the highest European level had some influence,” said Bruyninckx. “Dries Mertens plays for Napoli, Steve Defour for Porto, Omar El Khadouri at Torino and many others I had in my academy are promising pro players.”</p>\n<p>Bruyninckx has long argued that while football has largely been dominated by developments in sports science that have helped improve players’ athleticism, the brain has been overlooked in the way teams and individuals are coached.</p>\n<p>He recently gave a two-hour presentation of his ideas to a group of Dutch football legends - Leo Beenhakker, Dennis Bergkamp, Ronald de Boer and Wim Kieft - and describes their feedback as “one big joy.”</p>\n<p>Riga and Bruyninckx, who have recently returned to Europe from Qatar where they were working at the Gulf country’s Aspire Academy, were invited to Milan last August for a 10-day training camp working with the club’s Under-17, U-16 and U-15 squads.</p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.edition.cnn.com/2013/10/10/sport/football/football-belgium-dembele-world-cup/index.html\">Read: The rising force in world football?</a></p>\n<p>“We will assist the coaches and explain our ideas step-by-step to guarantee AC Milan can anticipate the development of football related to what the future game needs are,” Bruyninckx told CNN.</p>\n<p>“I think everybody begins to understand that the football game at the highest level is no longer based on athletic potential and ability but that the brain ability and potential has got an enormous influence. Faster moving and decision making can only be achieved through brain anticipation processes.”</p>\n<p>MilanLab staff member Domenico Gualtieri echoes Bruyninckx’s philosophy. &quot;Our job is not just to get the fastest most athletic players on the pitch,&quot; Gualtieri told the Milan website,  &quot;we also want to give the players the instruments to take care of problems themselves while on the pitch,”</p>\n<div><a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/video/data/2.0/video/sports/2013/10/13/world-cup-trophy-tour.cnn.html\">Click to watch video</a></div>\n<p>The training drills Bruyninckx uses start off simply but grow in complexity to foster concentration and touch. This idea of &quot;overload&quot; ensures that the players are more actively involved during an exercise even when they are not on the ball. If they are not concentrating the move breaks down.</p>\n<p>The pre-eminence of the team over the individual is key for Bruyninckx - &quot;we have to do it together&quot; is one of his mantras - and in the past when we have met, he showed a video of players performing various training routines, joking that what they are is doing is football's equivalent of social media networking.</p>\n<p>“It's striking that the future game is most of all based on team performance,” said Bruyninckx.</p>\n<p>“Team creativity can only be achieved if players have a huge mutual solidarity and they put their individual search for success aside. The player's individual speed has been replaced by a team's high-speed performance.</p>\n<p>“Look how at Neymar is struggling to get into the Barca patterns.

Mentally-balanced players that stay together for many years and have the grit for many hours of deliberate practice and play will show again how our social network can have an influence on football development.</p>\n<p>“Aren't the team coherence and format of Barca and Bayern Munich the best examples?”</p>\n<p>Riga and Bruyninckx will work under AC Milan's methodology coordinator Aldo Dolcetti, who also emphasized this was a long-term project for the Serie A club.</p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://worldsport.blogs.cnn.com/2013/09/10/will-belgium-win-the-world-cup/\">Read: Can Belgium win the 2014 World Cup?</a></p>\n<p>“Eleven teams and one club,” Dolcetti told the Milan website. “We’ve been working since June on delivering the targets that have been set for the next few years. The aim is to get players from the youth sector to the first team, ready to play at the San Siro.&quot;</p>\n<p>Filippo Galli, head of Milan’s youth setup, added: &quot;We wanted everyone to help in the construction of the Milan model in terms of uniformity of playing concepts and behavior shared by all players and staff.</p>\n<p>“Chief executive Adriano Galliani was behind the idea of the methodology of a Milan model which will stay with the club for years, regardless of the people involved in making it happen.”</p>\n<p>The club has traditionally spent big on star players, funded by billionaire owner Silvio Berlusconi, but its new approach has been in part forced by tougher economic times and new financial fair play rules introduced by European football's ruling body.</p>\n<p>&quot;The current economic situation combined with new UEFA regulations has forced Europe's big clubs to invest heavily in youth development,&quot; AC Milan's head of youth scouting Mauro Bianchessi told Reuters in May.</p>\n<p>According to the CIES (International Center for Sports Studies) Football Observatory's 2013 Demographic Study, Italy has the lowest percentage of players who spent three years at the club they are at now between the ages of 15 and 21.</p>\n<p>The partnership between the Belgian duo and Milan runs only until June 2014, as Riga and Bruyninckx want to showcase their approach to other clubs and federations.</p>\n<p>“In the coming months I'll concentrate most of all on AC Milan, but I also want to show more and more how ‘Brain Centered Learning’ can have an influence on school performance,” said Bruyninckx.</p>\n<p>“My country has decided to give me the opportunity to present my ideas to the educational world. The better a child can learn the better his or her future will be.</p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.edition.cnn.com/2012/11/16/sport/football/dortmund-footbonaut-robot-football/index.html\">Read: Space age training with 'Footbonaut'</a></p>\n<p>“We all have an individual desire to show our skills, but then we first need to find out what a child is looking for, based on his or her personal interest.

There was a large and vocal crowd at Game One of the Finals between the Minnesota Lynx and the Atlanta Dream, which was played at Target Center (the Lynx's home court, which they share with the Minnesota Timberwolves of the NBA).</p>\n<p>The play certainly contradicted stereotypes that surround the WBNA. Maya Moore was the best player on the court as she led the Lynx to a convincing victory, while Lindsay Whalen, the Lynx’s point guard, shone in orchestrating the offense and distributing the ball.</p>\n<p>The fact that the height differentials between the players aren't as drastic as the men's game allows for a different style of play, especially in the passing aspect.</p>\n<p>As an avid fan of basketball who appreciates the nuances of the sport, it almost gives the play an old school feel.</p>\n<p>And how refreshing that there was little to no ego on the court. No Kobe Bryant pleading to the refs to call a foul every time he misses a shot; no Joakim Noah screaming at the crowd every time he makes an And-1 as if he just won a battle to the death in the Coliseum in Rome.</p>\n<p>If to be humble in moments of triumph is a true showing of character then all of the players on both the Lynx and the Dream exuded that in spades. After sweeping the Atlanta Dream 3-0 to win their second WNBA title in three Finals appearances it appears that they could be a dynasty in the making.</p>\n<p>The WNBA is not the first women’s professional basketball league. The first attempt dates back to 1978, and was called the WBL, the Women’s Professional Basketball League.</p>\n<p>There were several other incarnations of a professional women’s basketball league, but none made it very far off the ground.</p>\n<p>Compare this history to women’s professional football, which was re-launched this year after being dismantled in 2011 after a two-year stint and arguably begs the question is there more of a demand for women’s basketball in the U.S.?</p>\n<p>But what about the fans of the women's game? WNBA viewing figures for this season went up 19% on NBATV from last season, and increased 28% on ESPN2, while for the first time the lottery draft was televised on prime time.</p>\n<p>&quot;We saw an incredible increase in individual ticket sales which I think is a sign of growth among new and casual fans,&quot; WBNA president Laurel Richie told reporters.</p>\n<p>There are 12 teams in the WNBA, a relatively small number compared to other professional leagues in the U.S. Originally when league play started in 1997, all 12 were owned by the NBA, but now six are under independent ownership - the Los Angeles Sparks, Connecticut Sun, Chicago Sky, Tulsa Shock, Seattle Storm, and the Atlanta Dream – an encouraging sign for the future.</p>\n<p>A number of international players have found success in the WNBA. Lauren Jackson of Australia, Ticha Penicheiro of Portugal, and Svetlana Abrosimova of Russia, have all won at least one WNBA championship, while Brazil, Canada, France, Spain and Italy, have also been represented in the league.</p>\n<p>The salaries of teams and players are capped, and no one can be paid over $101,500 a year. </p>\n<p>This is insignificant when compared to most other professional athletes who make at least five times that, but some WBNA teams are also beginning to advertise sponsors on their uniforms, in the way all English Premier League teams do.</p>\n<p>This is not common practice in the U.S. and it will be interesting to see if it sets a trend. </p>\n<p>&quot;On the partnership front, State Farm joined us this year and Proctor &amp; Gamble came back… We have seen across the league teams in both cases, our sponsorship revenue is up this year.&quot; said Richie.</p>\n<p>It's impossible to predict what direction the WBNA will take in the future, but the signs are increasingly encouraging.</p>\n<br> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/cnniworldsport.wordpress.com/9777/\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/cnniworldsport.wordpress.com/9777/\" border=\"0\"></a> <img height=\"1\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=worldsport.blogs.cnn.com&blog=8188608&post=9777&subd=cnniworldsport&ref=&feed=1\" border=\"0\"><img height=\"1\" width=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/rss/edition_worldsportblog/~4/2L8mdsYOcJA\">","direction":"ltr"},"author":"jsinnottcnn","crawled":1382088982814,"title":"New era for women's basketball in the U.S.","summary":{"content":"Derided, mocked and supposedly needing life resuscitation, reports of the Women’s Basketball Association’s demise have been greatly exaggerated.

I think he would be able to play for England because of residency in five years.”</p>\n<p>Hodgson has admitted he would welcome a debate within England about naturalizing players.</p>\n<p>&quot;There's no doubt that he's a real talent and we have our eyes on him, but a lot will have to be discussed,&quot; Hodgson said of Januzaj’s sudden emergence.</p>\n<p>&quot;He's been with United for a long period of time and of course that discussion will have to be seriously debated before we start naturalizing players.</p>\n<p>&quot;Yes (he could play for England) down the line if he becomes naturalized or if he becomes a homegrown product.&quot;</p>\n<p>Ilori is eligible to represent England as he was born in London and has yet to receive a senior call-up to the Portuguese national side, though he is already capped at under-18, under-19 and under-20 level for Portugal.</p>\n<p>&quot;I think I would like to stay loyal to Portugal as I've played in every age group for them,” Ilori, who recently arrived at Anfield in a deal worth £7 million, <a href=\"http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/new-liverpool-fc-signing-tiago-5873037\">told the Liverpool Echo.</a></p>\n<p>&quot;But I would never close any doors and there is no decision to make yet. If I have the choice then it's not a bad choice to have.&quot;</p>\n<p>Hodgson’s interest in Januzaj prompted groans of dismay from some leading English football writers on Twitter.</p>\n<p>“No way should Januzaj play football for England even if it were possible - cricket, though, is another matter, we're not fussed about origins,” <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GlennMoore7\">joked the Independent’s Glenn Moore.</a></p>\n<p>“We should probably leave him be rather than embarrass ourselves,” added <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Matt_Lawton_DM\">the Mail’s Matt Lawton on Twitter.</a></p>\n<p>But is Hodgson jumping the gun and would Januzaj even want to play for England, given his family background?</p>\n<p>“In the past two decades we've had an empire and a federation collapse, the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia,” <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/When-Friday-Comes-Revolution-ebook/dp/B00CFPWQVO\">author James Montague, who has written extensively about the subject of nationality and football,</a> told CNN.</p>\n<p>“It suddenly created dozens of new countries and new football teams. War has meant others have found themselves in new countries with a new team, like Sweden’s Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who could have played for either Bosnia or Croatia.</p>\n<p>“Januzaj's case is an example of the one hangover from that time. Kosovo is not recognized by the United Nations.</p>\n<p>“Therefore its national football team is not recognised by UEFA. Because of the war there many Kosovars settled in Switzerland and Belgium. As they had no state is was easy for them to gain citizenship, or I should say easier.</p>\n<p>“Now you have a whole generation of players whose parents are Kosovar, who proudly self identify as Kosovar but who play for Switzerland because there was no national team to play for. Xherdan Shaqiri, Granit Xhaka, Valon Behrami are just a few.</p>\n<p>“That's why it is not a given Januzaj would play for Belgium or England or even Albania,” added Montague. “Kosovars are ethnically Albanian and some have chosen to play there, like Lorik Cana.</p>\n<p>“If Kosovo had a national team today it would be one of the strongest in Europe. But UEFA president Michel Platini is dead against it.</p>\n<p>“There has been strong opposition from the Russians and Serbians who oppose any kind of recognition. FIFA president Sepp Blatter is in favor.”</p>\n<p>It might also be argued, <a href=\"http://www.esrc.ac.uk/news-and-events/features-casestudies/features/23326/attitudes-towards-immigration-hardening-but-nuanced.aspx\">in the light of hardening attitudes in Britain on immigration,</a> that England's pursuit of players like Januzaj is akin to saying: &quot;You're one of us as long as you help us win the World Cup?&quot;</p>\n<div><a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/video/data/2.0/video/sports/2013/07/03/intl-brazil-rio-infrastructure-pinto-pkg.cnn.html\">Click to watch video</a></div>\n<p>Even the reigning world and European champions Spain have been looking at the small print of players’ nationality.</p>\n<p>Having often reverted to playing without a traditional striker, Del Bosque could in the near future pick Atletico Madrid's Brazil-born forward Diego Costa, who has expressed a desire to play for Spain.</p>\n<p>But not quite yet - last week the Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) said Costa cannot be called into Del Bosque’s squad until the necessary paperwork is completed.</p>\n<p>Costa tops the La Liga scoring charts with 10 goals and recently scored the winner in Atletico's 1-0 La Liga triumph at Real Madrid.</p>\n<p>Which begs the question, should world governing body FIFA be doing more to provide clarity on <a href=\"http://www.fifa.com/mm/document/affederation/generic/02/14/97/88/fifastatuten2013_e_neutral.pdf\">eligibility rules for international football?</a></p>\n<p>Those rules enabled Thiago Motta to win three caps for Brazil in matches deemed friendlies before he went on to represent Italy.</p>\n<p>Which seems, frankly, ridiculous. And surely if you have played for a country’s youth side that means you have made a decision as to which international team you want to play for?</p>\n<p>“FIFA’s rules have been beefed up in recent years,” <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JamesPiotr\">said Montague.</a></p>\n<p>“Today a player needs to have lived somewhere for five years.

And if the judgement of Mr Hubbard is to be valued nearly one hundred years after his unfortunate <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/1997/jul/19/home/hm-14499\">death at the hands of a German U-Boat</a> then it’s probably fair to assume such a gathering of bureaucrats won’t make for a great spectator occasion either.</p>\n<p>However, even if you’re a sport hack more used to the drama-drenched fare of World Cup football, the deliberations of soccer’s biggest suits at the 28th executive committee (ExCo) on Thursday and Friday just might be different.</p>\n<p>That’s because agenda point 25.2 will see a discussion on the future of the controversial 2022 World Cup in Qatar, an important bone of contention for a number of reasons:</p>\n<p><em><strong>1) FIFA’s credibility is on the line …<br>\n</strong></em>Ok, so maybe it’s a little like closing the gate after the horse has bolted on this one, but as the governing body for the planet’s most popular game, a sport that has a unique ability to enthral, unite and inspire people around the globe, is it too much to ask that those in power govern its future responsibly? FIFA’s recent effort to end racism in the game was admirable and in stark contrast to the farcical situation of recent years in which FIFA ExCo member Mohamed bin Hammam was banned for life, while fellow executives Amos Adamu and Reynald Temarii were fined and suspended, on the grounds of corruption and bribery. Their involvement in the voting systems that delivered Sepp Blatter’s fourth presidency and Qatar’s hosting of the 2022 World Cup stained the results in many people’s eyes. The decision to award the 2022 tournament to Qatar - a desert nation whose July temperatures often reach 50 degress Celsius (122 degress Fahrenheit) and a location that even the chairman of FIFA’s medical committee (another one!) Michel D’Hooghe advised might not be the most hospitable climate for thousands of football fans to mill around in – has prompted a barrage of criticism. Much of that criticism has come from Europe, unhappy over the gathering momentum to stage the 2022 World Cup in the Qatar winter rather the summer. It is now FIFA’s task to show leadership and find a solution that will placate the dissenters. If discussions in Switzerland lead to the 2022 World Cup being moved elsewhere - given the billions of dollars (the New York Times valued the Qatar bid at $50bn) that has been spent on the bid process, where does that leave FIFA’s already shaky credibility?</p>\n<a name=\"pd_a_7443186\"></a>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n<noscript><a href=\"http://polldaddy.com/poll/7443186\">Take Our Poll</a></noscript>\n<p><em><strong>2) Sepp Blatter’s legacy …<br>\n</strong></em>The curious shelving of the agenda point to limit the length and age limit of a FIFA president from May’s Exco could suggest Sepp Blatter feels he has much work left to do as head of the global game. The multilingual 77-year-old has his critics, not least for his questionable off-the-cuff comments. His previous suggestion that women players could wear ‘tighter shorts’ to enhance the appeal of their game, that homosexuals should ‘refrain from sexual activities’ if travelling to Qatar for the World Cup and that the adultery of former England captain John Terry would be ‘applauded’ in Latin countries, have done nothing to enhance his reputation. The fining and suspension or banning of corrupt FIFA officials - many of whom worked closely with Blatter - and his loose tongue arguably have come to define the Swiss administrator over what he would see as his major achievements. “The public perception of FIFA and FIFA’s view of itself don’t seem to connect in any way,” Alexandra Wrage, who resigned from FIFA’s Independent Governance Committee this year, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/02/sports/soccer/in-fifa-politics-blatter-is-the-consummate-player.html\">recently told the New York Times</a>. “The disconnect is pretty alarming.” Despite the disconnect, it was through Blatter’s drive that FIFA became one of the only major international organisations to recognize Palestine as nation and as his recent work to ease travel restrictions through Israel of Palestinian players shows, his commitment to this sensitive cause remains. It is also under his tenure that Asia and Africa hosted the World Cup for the first time and with Russia staging the 2018 tournament he has also delivered its debut in the former Communist bloc. Blatter feels that a World Cup in the Middle East would be his crowning glory, despite voting for the U.S. to host in 2022, and consequently it would be a big personal defeat if this opportunity slipped from his grasp.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em><strong>3) Money matters …<br>\n</strong></em>The plan that many feel is the best way forward would be to reschedule the Qatar World Cup to a more hospitable time of year, around the month of November or January for example when temperatures average around 20C. This is a challenging idea to deliver because it would mean disrupting the league schedules and 100-year traditions of some of the world’s most lucrative sport franchises - including the European Champions League, the English Premier League, La Liga and Serie A - for upto six weeks. Moving matches means shifting many of the events that broadcasters have paid multi-millions for and, importantly, would be wanting to tie up in contracts for the future. European football administrators have recently warmed to the idea of a winter move in principle but this could merely be their starting position for complex negotiations that may ultimately require compensation payments. On top of this, Fox Sports and Telemundo paid $1 billion for the rights to broadcast the 2018 and 2022 World Cups in America on the basis the event would take place in June.  The legal intricacies of any switch could be complex and time-consuming which plays into the theory that at most the ExCo this week will announce a task force to investigate potential solutions rather than rush the decision.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em><strong>4) Cutural catalyst for Qatar ...<br>\n</strong></em>If FIFA were to take the nuclear option of moving the 2022 World Cup away from Qatar altogether, what impact does that have on the Gulf state? The accusations that Qatar supports a form of <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2013/04/30/sport/football/football-qatar-world-cup-2022-worker-rights/index.html\">slavery for foreign workers</a> and has ‘questionable’ prohibitive laws banning homosexual activity are just two areas that have come under scrutiny by primarily Western-based media recently. Whether the hosting of international sporting events really do act as a catalyst for the improvement of human rights is questionable but undoubtedly the exposure of the Qatari culture to the world, and vice versa, is an unavoidable result of staging one of the most televised events in human history. Advocates like Blatter would argue the potential for a greater understanding between differing cultures would be lost.</p>\n<p>To add to the intrigue of the build up, former New York attorney Michael Garcia - head of the investigative arm of FIFA's ethics committee (that's three and counting) - announced earlier this week that he would be visiting all nations who bid for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups to <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2013/10/02/sport/football/russia-2018-qatar-2022-football/index.html\">assess their bidding process</a>.</p>\n<p>A sign of concern that Mark Pieth, chairman of the Independent Governance Committee (four!), added to when he told CNN he had &quot;very serious doubts&quot; over the procedure that delivered the awarding of the tournament to Qatar.</p>\n<p>The pressure is mounting for FIFA to act and to show that committees, despite their poor reputation, can deliver.</p>\n<br> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/cnniworldsport.wordpress.com/9731/\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/cnniworldsport.wordpress.com/9731/\" border=\"0\"></a> <img height=\"1\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=worldsport.blogs.cnn.com&blog=8188608&post=9731&subd=cnniworldsport&ref=&feed=1\" border=\"0\"><img height=\"1\" width=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/rss/edition_worldsportblog/~4/2lreWZuiYM0\">","direction":"ltr"},"published":1380721808000,"crawled":1380721840669,"alternate":[{"href":"http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_worldsportblog/~3/2lreWZuiYM0/","type":"text/html"}],"updated":1380888536000,"title":"FIFA's folly?: What's riding on the Qatar question ...","canonical":[{"href":"http://worldsport.blogs.cnn.com/2013/10/02/fifas-folly-whats-riding-on-the-qatar-question/","type":"text/html"}],"summary":{"content":"As events go, committee meetings usually engender the same level of excitement as that felt by Willy Wonka on hearing his dentist appointment has been brought forward. “A committee is a thing which takes a week to do what one good man can do in an hour,” was the assessment of American writer Elbert Hubbard.

So what’s stopping it?</p>\n<p>The primary issue is the logistical nightmare of having to schedule 128 first-round matches, each with the potential of going five hours long.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://worldsport.blogs.cnn.com/2013/09/09/can-serena-williams-become-the-greatest/\">Blog: Can Serena become the greatest ever?</a></p>\n<p>One proposed suggestion would be to have both the men and women play best-of-three sets for the opening rounds, and best-of-five for the latter. This would allow for the more competitive matches featuring the biggest names to generate the greater drama.</p>\n<p>After all, drama is what brings in the money.</p>\n<p>Looking retrospectively, this format would not have impacted the epic best-of-five set finals, such as the classic Bjorn Borg-John McEnroe clash in 1980, or the remarkable Roger Federer-Nadal final from 2008. However, early round battles such as the 11+ hour marathon match between John Isner and Nicolas Mahut would have been over in under two hours.</p>\n<p>These gladiatorial battles underscore the exceptional mental and physical demands of a grand slam, in a way conventional tennis tournaments do not. The excitement of a best-of-five set marathon is a unique and special experience in tennis, and one denied to half the grand slam participants.</p>\n<p>Doesn’t Maria Sharapova deserve the opportunity to fight back from two-sets down to clinch victory from the jaws of defeat? Doesn’t the New York crowd deserve to see Serena Williams and Victoria Azarenka go the distance over five sets, testing their physical and mental superiority to the max?</p>\n<p>As Murray continued to say in his recent interview, playing best-of-five sets “is what makes [grand slams] different.”</p>\n<p>Maybe this is the point. During the regular season, both men and women must win five best-of-three set matches over a week in order to take home the title. During a grand slam, the men must win seven best-of-five set matches over two weeks, whereas women need only to win seven best-of-three set matches over the same two weeks. </p>\n<p>Added pressure aside, the physical demands for women during a grand slam are actually less than during the regular season.</p>\n<p>By allowing women to play best-of-five, you are separating the grand slam’s from the rest of the tour, making them special events, for special athletes.</p>\n<p>The one major problem with assessing a tennis player’s fiscal worth by their length of play is assuming that their work day begins with the toss of the coin, and ends with shaking hands. </p>\n<p>Playing matches is just a small part of the job of a full-time tennis professional, who train and travel year-round, and have done in most cases since they were too young to see above the airport check-in counter. This is just as true for the women as it is for the men.</p>\n<p>Former world No. 6 Gilles Simon has been one of the more outspoken and controversial opponents of equal pay, suggesting that the men deserve more money, because they provide greater entertainment.</p>\n<p>In response to this, Sharapova quipped, “I'm sure there are a few more people that watch my matches than his.”</p>\n<p>And she’s right. People watch sports to see their favorite players, and for tennis, these fan-favorites are limited to just a few marquee names. </p>\n<p>Serena Williams and Sharapova are just as a big draw for the fans as the top men are, and people tune in in the millions to watch them perform.</p>\n<p>At this year’s U.S. Open, the women’s final pulled higher domestic television ratings than the men’s final, scoring a 4.9, with the men’s a comparatively low 2.8. </p>\n<p>This can be attributed to Serena Williams being American, but that’s largely the point. People watch players they are rooting for, even if it’s only best-of-three sets, or “not as entertaining.&quot;</p>\n<p>It’s much like when you choose to see a movie. You’re not looking at the showtimes to see which movie is longest. You choose the films featuring your favorite actors, by your favorite directors or producers. And you certainly would not expect to pay more if the movie was longer.</p>\n<div><a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/video/data/2.0/video/sports/2013/09/19/spc-open-court-us-open-nadal.cnn.html\">Click to watch video</a></div>\n<p>While the offer from the WTA's Allaster is generous, it is perhaps disingenuous. Of all the events her player participate in, the only events for which she is willing to make such an offer are the four events governed by the International Tennis Federation, where she has no jurisdiction over.</p>\n<p>If the WTA were serious about playing best-of-five, they would incorporate it more into their own events.</p>\n<p>An ideal time to test best-of-five sets for the women’s game would be at the annual end of year WTA Tour Championships. In fact, from 1984 to 1998, this event culminated in a best-of-five final, including an epic five-set thriller between Steffi Graf and Martina Hingis.</p>\n<p>If these matches proved successful and popular, we’ll have a real debate on our hands.</p>\n<p>But for now, the debate is essentially a none-starter. The media isn’t clamoring for it, the fans aren’t asking for it, and the players - despite what they say - don’t really want it. </p>\n<p>If Andy Murray thinks that someone who trains for a 600 meter race deserves more than someone who trains to run 400 meters, maybe he should speak to Usain Bolt, the highest paid track star on the planet, who makes his money training for a race that lasts less than 10 seconds.</p>\n<br> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/cnniworldsport.wordpress.com/9716/\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/cnniworldsport.wordpress.com/9716/\" border=\"0\"></a> <img height=\"1\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=worldsport.blogs.cnn.com&blog=8188608&post=9716&subd=cnniworldsport&ref=&feed=1\" border=\"0\"><img height=\"1\" width=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/rss/edition_worldsportblog/~4/sncYrFHxNOA\">","direction":"ltr"},"updated":1380557761000,"title":"Equal work for equal pay?","published":1380554161000,"crawled":1380554170001,"alternate":[{"href":"http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_worldsportblog/~3/sncYrFHxNOA/","type":"text/html"}],"canonical":[{"href":"http://worldsport.blogs.cnn.com/2013/09/30/equal-work-for-equal-pay/","type":"text/html"}],"summary":{"content":"Usually the practice of equal work predates the debate for equal pay.

But when one of the NBA’s biggest stars pulled on a pair of blue socks – festooned with bright yellow ducks – it struck me that this assignment was way more surreal than anything I was used to. Or, for that matter, comfortable with.</p>\n<p>With a group of about 20 other men and women, I had just watched the Houston Rockets’ shooting guard James Harden emerge dripping wet from the shower, dry off and get dressed … all from a distance of about two and a half feet. This was my introduction to the world of sports reporting in the United States!<span></span></p>\n<p>It doesn’t happen like that in Europe. Every professional team that I’d ever covered kept the media on a tight leash. Many a long hour was spent waiting in the players’ tunnel or kicking my feet in parking lot, hanging around until after the coach’s debrief, until all the showers and the massages were done and all the clothes were on.</p>\n<p>And even then it was controlled; mixed zones mean that everyone has to walk past the media but there is no obligation to stop. It’s very easy for anyone who’s had a poor game to avoid the most pertinent questions.</p>\n<p>In the U.S. however, it’s open season. The biggest cultural difference between reporting on sport in the UK and across the pond is that everyone here is allowed into the locker-room. The access is great, but it does create some very unusual situations.</p>\n<p>Harden had just played the game of his life, scoring a career-high 45 points against the Atlanta Hawks. His reward? The opportunity to get dressed in about two square feet of real estate, the only space left available once a semi-circle of reporters and cameramen had formed around his locker.</p>\n<p>We patiently waited as he reached for his underwear, which for the record was green, and as he struggled to maintain his balance while pulling on those socks - everyone trying really hard to give the impression that they weren’t watching someone getting dressed.</p>\n<p>That’s pretty hard to do at point-blank range, but it seemed that I was the only one who thought this was all rather bizarre. In the U.S., this has become the norm for athletes and reporters.</p>\n<div><a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/video/data/2.0/video/world/2013/07/03/riddell-mayweather-boxing-childhood.cnn.html\">Click to watch video</a></div>\n<p>I’ve discussed it with seasoned sports reporters who cannot imagine a world in which they wouldn’t have regular access to the players on their beat. A player you are chronicling needs to have a right of reply; the journalist reporting a missed tackle or a dropped catch needs to know why it happened. Otherwise, too much is assumed and the sports fans are cheated.</p>\n<p>In the UK and most of Europe, there’s no way that professional teams would ever willingly open their dressing-room doors. But they’re coming under pressure. With more and more overseas interest in products like soccer's English Premier League, and with the value of each new television contract soaring ever upwards, broadcasters are demanding more for their money.</p>\n<p>A request to bring cameras into an area long considered sacrosanct was rebuffed during the latest contract negotiations between the Premier League and BT Sport, one of its two British broadcasters, but it’s getting harder to say no. The very notion of such access creates panic among club chairmen and managers who worry that prying eyes will broadcast behavior which could bring their team, or the game as a whole, into disrepute.</p>\n<p>Britain’s tabloid culture makes Premier League teams especially nervous; many journalists could exploit and make hay with such unfettered access. But in any case, most of the players have become so used to keeping a low profile that the pressure to constantly explain themselves would be overwhelming.</p>\n<p>They’ve had a long time to get used to it in the U.S., but that doesn’t mean the players actually like it. According to one NFL veteran, the players would vote against it if they could. Whether they’re muddy and sweaty, half-dressed or totally undressed, none is a particularly good image with which to send out a message.</p>\n<p>From their perspective, it’s like the running of the bulls in Pamplona when the door is opened and the press pack is allowed in. Some will reach for a towel before taking questions, but others – usually those who hold the media in contempt – make little or no effort to cover up.</p>\n<p>In one instance a few years back, a football player took questions while he was sitting naked, &quot;meat on seat&quot; as the jocks would put it. He kept his legs wide open as he appraised his role in the game. If you think that might be odd for a male reporter, how do you think female journalists feel?</p>\n<div><a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/video/data/2.0/video/sports/2013/03/21/open-court-rafael-nadal-mexico.cnn.html\">Click to watch video</a></div>\n<p>The push for equality in American sports reporting was an uncomfortable one for all concerned. The behavior was boorish, reporters were harassed, lawsuits were filed. It was an era recently profiled in the ESPN documentary &quot;Let them wear towels&quot; and although things have since calmed down, players’ wives are far from thrilled that their partners are in a state of undress with other ladies present.</p>\n<p>I’m sure that in time I’ll get used to this new reporting culture and I’ll watch with interest the developments back home in Europe. Is there a happy medium? If so, I’m sure many would be keen to find it, but there’s another reason American reporters like it their way: the sooner the post-match interview, the better it is. In the locker-room, the haze of battle has yet to clear, the emotions are raw, observations less guarded. Wait a while and their views become more objective and much more filtered.</p>\n<p>Given that it’s the fans we’re all doing this for, I suspect that in the U.S. they like it just the way it is.

I’m sure much of that can be attributed to Germany’s recent stars.</p>\n<p>While at the yearling sales I was treated to a <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/video/?/video/sports/2013/09/01/spc-winning-post-yearling-vetting.cnn\">step-by-step guide on how to vet a yearling at the sales by the charming Robert Dallas. </a>It’s not surprising that when tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars are being spent on future racehorses that the buyer wants assurance from a vet that it is likely to be able to gallop.</p>\n<p>The third Winning Post story took place about 500 kilometers north of Baden-Baden, in Gutersloh, home to both Novellist and his jockey Eddie Pedroza.</p>\n<div><a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/video/data/2.0/video/sports/2013/08/31/spc-winning-post-panama-jockey-eddy-pedroza.cnn.html\">Click to watch video</a></div>\n<p>Born in Panama, Eddie has been riding in Germany for the last 20 years, having been recommended the move by a friend of his father.

He probably wouldn’t want it any other way.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2013/09/22/sport/football/manchester-city-united-epl-football/index.html?hpt=isp_c2\">Read: Man City crushes Man Utd in derby</a></p>\n<p>Suarez’s rap sheet is a lengthy one.</p>\n<p>There is the racism dispute, the lengthy bans, the biting, the diving and the deliberate handballs. When it comes to football’s dark arts, the 26-year-old Suarez is a master practitioner.</p>\n<p>And yet, and yet….amid the darkness lies a footballer of unparalleled genius.</p>\n<p>There’s the non-stop work rate, the quicksilver feet and the goals - 23 of them in 33 Premier League appearances last season. No wonder Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger was willing to stump up 40 million and that solitary pound during the transfer window to sign Suarez.</p>\n<p>And he's not just nifty with his feet and teeth. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qUg8tAaStI\">A recent appearance in an advert for a Uruguayan bank suggests Suarez possesses a gift for comic timing – and an ability to laugh at himself.</a></p>\n<p>It’s a package of gifts –- football rather than thespian - that makes Suarez arguably one of the world’s top five players, a prized asset Liverpool’s owners were determined not to sell to one of their domestic rivals.</p>\n<p>&quot;What do you think they're smoking over there at Emirates?&quot; tweeted Liverpool owner John W Henry, mocking Arsenal’s bid for the Uruguayan, unhappy at the London club’s seemingly detailed knowledge of Suarez’s contract.</p>\n<p>Liverpool’s former technical director Damien Comolli is in no doubt the club made the right decision to keep hold of Suarez.</p>\n<p>“If I had still been at Liverpool I would have done everything to keep him,” Comolli told CNN. “As you say he’s in the top five of the world’s best players.</p>\n<p>“That calibre of player is very difficult to find and why so many clubs were interested in him. Don’t forget Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger is an astute buyer in the transfer market. Why else would he have wanted to have signed Suarez?</p>\n<p>“When I was at Liverpool at no point did we ever think of selling him. He’s a fantastic lad - the way he trains, the way he always gives 100% and the way he has often carried the team.</p>\n<p>“What we loved about Suarez was that he had everything - creativity, finishing and commitment. He wants to play, he wants to work and he wants to win.</p>\n<p>“When Suarez is in your team the opposition aren’t going to bully you, whether you are playing home or away.”</p>\n<p>But how do Liverpool supporters view Suarez’s impending return?</p>\n<p>“I think Liverpool fans are savvy enough to realize that Suarez is a world-class player and given the club's current standing - now into a fourth season without Champions League football –- players of his ilk are difficult to attract and replace,” said <a href=\"https://twitter.com/robbohuyton\">Gareth Roberts, editor</a> of <a href=\"http://liverpoolfc.wellredmag.co.uk/\">Liverpool fanzine Well Red.</a></p>\n<p>“If he comes back into the side and picks up where he left off last season, I think the nonsense over the summer will be quickly forgotten about.</p>\n<p>“I certainly don't envisage him being booed - if anything many Liverpool fans seems keen to show they still support him. That said, plenty are unhappy with how he conducted himself over the close season and rightly so. </p>\n<p>“Most of the supporters I speak to wouldn't have begrudged Suarez a move to one of the truly big clubs abroad - I'm thinking Barcelona, Real Madrid or Bayern Munich,” said Roberts.</p>\n<p>“Had any of those clubs come in for him and paid $80 million plus for him, I don't think we could have complained too much.</p>\n<p>“Once Arsenal came knocking that was a different story. It felt like a challenge to Liverpool's status, and it made little sense to improve a rival while simultaneously weakening your own side. John Henry came out of it very well. </p>\n<p>“It was good to see some strong leadership at Anfield. I still think Suarez will go, perhaps as soon as January. But not to Arsenal, and hopefully not to any other side in the Premier League.”</p>\n<p>Liverpool have coped relatively well in Suarez absence. Brendan Rodgers’ side are fifth in the Premier League table – two points behind leaders Arsenal - while striker Daniel Sturridge has revelled playing as Liverpool’s lone striker, scoring four goals in five games.</p>\n<p>Indeed there is a school of thought that Liverpool might have been better to cash in on Suarez. When the Uruguayan played in the team last season their league win percentage fell from 42% to 36%. </p>\n<p>When he came back from the racism ban, Liverpool won just one out of their next 10 games, while Sturridge is twice as prolific when he is the sole striker.</p>\n<p>Comolli remains sceptical about those statistics, arguing that the sample is not big enough to draw firm conclusions from and that they also don’t reveal the difficulty of the opposition or whether games were played home or away.</p>\n<p>&quot;Liverpool have got some very smart people looking at the numbers,&quot; said Comolli.</p>\n<p>Roberts added: &quot;Results have certainly been good when he isn't in the side, but I don't think that tells the whole story.</p>\n<p>“Suarez is capable of things few footballers in the world can do and as a fan, that is what you pay your money for.</p>\n<p>“I think perhaps Suarez has felt there is too much responsibility on his shoulders to win games in the past and has tried to do it all on his own. </p>\n<p>“Perhaps now, particularly if he comes into the side in a deeper role as has been suggested by Rodgers, we will see a better Liverpool team with Suarez in it.”</p>\n<p>Over to you Luis…..</p>\n<br> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/cnniworldsport.wordpress.com/9678/\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/cnniworldsport.wordpress.com/9678/\" border=\"0\"></a> <img height=\"1\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=worldsport.blogs.cnn.com&blog=8188608&post=9678&subd=cnniworldsport&ref=&feed=1\" border=\"0\"><img height=\"1\" width=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/rss/edition_worldsportblog/~4/W1LcvI0LOOU\">","direction":"ltr"},"canonical":[{"href":"http://worldsport.blogs.cnn.com/2013/09/24/luis-suarez-returns-demon-or-genius/","type":"text/html"}],"enclosure":[{"href":"http://i1.wp.com/i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/130920163659-luis-suarez-liverpool-tease-story-top.jpg?resize=120%2C68","length":28800,"type":"image/jpeg"}],"author":"jsinnottcnn","origin":{"htmlUrl":"http://worldsport.blogs.cnn.com","streamId":"feed/http://rss.cnn.com/rss/edition_worldsportblog.rss","title":"CNN World Sport"},"summary":{"content":"It has been a long five-month wait for Luis Suarez but football’s enfant terrible is back.

But among the statistics, there are numbers that have greater meaning among both players and fans alike. </p>\n<p>One of those is the record for home runs in a single season. In Japan, that record was set by Sadaharu Oh, who hit 55 homers in 1964. In the years since, two other foreign players had equalled Oh’s mark.</p>\n<p>But recently, former U.S. major league player Wladimir Balentien finally broke through, hitting home runs number 56 and 57 in just his 113th game of the season. I’m not great at math, but one homer every two games is a fantastic accomplishment.</p>\n<p>Oh, but I have forgotten to mention the other issue that always seems to accompany home run records in baseball. Controversy. </p>\n<p>Balentien has set his record in a season where a new, bouncier ball was introduced to help produce more homers and liven up the game. </p>\n<p>The Nippon Professional Baseball organization finally admitted to the new ball in June, after months of denials. </p>\n<p>So does this taint Balentien’s record? </p>\n<p>Well, consider this. At the time he hit his 57th home run, no other player in the league had more than 37 homers and only two had hit at least 30. </p>\n<p>So not everyone was taking advantage of the livelier ball it seems.</p>\n<p>Balentien is a native of the Caribbean island of Curacao and played for the Netherlands at the World Baseball Classic earlier this year. </p>\n<p>He made the move to Japan in 2011. He had played three seasons of Major League Baseball (MLB) from 2007 to 2009, hitting only 15 home runs in total. So clearly, Japanese baseball is not on a par with the brand played in the USA.</p>\n<p>But the two leagues do share a penchant for controversy when it comes to home run records.</p>\n<p>The MLB record was set by the legendary Babe Ruth, who hit 60 in 1927. 34 years later, Roger Maris hit 61 in 1961. </p>\n<p>But many at the time wanted an asterisk next to Maris’ achievement, because by then the season had been lengthened from 154 to 162 games. </p>\n<p>Then came the famous (infamous?) 1998 season, when both Mark McGwire (70) and Sammy Sosa (66) broke Maris’ record. Three years later, Barry Bonds hit 73 home runs to break the record again. </p>\n<p>But all three sluggers have been linked to using performance enhancing drugs during that time, with McGwire eventually admitting he used them.</p>\n<p>MLB has left all the records set during the so-called Steroid Era on the books. But the baseball writers eligible to vote on which players get into the sport’s Hall of Fame have so far shown little interest in letting anyone even remotely linked with doping into the Hall. </p>\n<p>But attitudes could change with the passage of time. Take for instance Balentein’s chase of the home run title this season. </p>\n<p>Some would argue that the biggest surprise was not that he set the record but the way the Japanese players and fans accepted the possibility that one of Japanese baseball’s most high-profile marks could be broken by a foreigner. </p>\n<p>Why the change of heart? It could be that the success of many Japanese players, led by Ichiro Suzuki, in the U.S. major leagues has helped Japanese fans change their view of foreign players plying their trade in Japan. </p>\n<p>It could be that in this time of ever-increasing globalization, barriers that once existed just no longer apply.</p>\n<p>Could a return to MLB be in the cards for Balentien? He is completing his third season in Japan and has clearly demonstrated his abilities at this level.</p>\n<p>At age 29, he is in the middle of what most believe are the prime years of a player’s career. Maybe it’s time to give it another shot.</p>\n<br> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/cnniworldsport.wordpress.com/9663/\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/cnniworldsport.wordpress.com/9663/\" border=\"0\"></a> <img height=\"1\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=worldsport.blogs.cnn.com&blog=8188608&post=9663&subd=cnniworldsport&ref=&feed=1\" border=\"0\"><img height=\"1\" width=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/rss/edition_worldsportblog/~4/Uh9_FVh2KXI\">","direction":"ltr"},"published":1379606463000,"crawled":1379606531090,"alternate":[{"href":"http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_worldsportblog/~3/Uh9_FVh2KXI/","type":"text/html"}],"updated":1379610063000,"title":"Is Wladimir Balentien worthy of baseball's home run record?","canonical":[{"href":"http://worldsport.blogs.cnn.com/2013/09/19/is-wladimir-balentien-worthy-of-baseballs-home-run-record/","type":"text/html"}],"summary":{"content":"Baseball is a game of statistics.

So it was a very dangerous sport where you had to go right to the limit and the chances to get killed were very big … today no grand prix driver has to think about this because there is no more danger,” Lauda told CNN.</p>\n<p>“There was a lot of fun I have to say because everybody there involved, racing drivers knew that life can be very short, so we did not want to miss anything, what we could do in this limited time. Everybody there was very happy crowd to race each other.”</p>\n<p>The fatalities in Formula One were clearly unacceptable and one of the sport’s greatest feats has been to improve the safety of racing. However, as Niki attests to, the precarious nature of their future provoked a greater freedom to their behaviour. </p>\n<p>Can the same be said in 2013? Has the new security seen a more mundane crowd take to the wheel? Sebastian Vettel is undoubtedly talented but his victory speeches, so laden with corporate mentions and sponsor thank-yous, are more Powerpoint presentation than spontaneous releases of passion. </p>\n<p>Mark Webber has been wonderfully outspoken at times but never won enough to attract suitable attention, he is also now leaving the sport after his motivation for F1 seemingly deserted him.

Extra points are earned for having a celebrity girlfriend who contributes to regular emotional turmoil in the 2008 champion’s private life</p>\n<p>2) <strong>Fernando Alonso</strong> – An undoubted star on the track, the pacey Spaniard mixes technical prowess with a brooding, ruthless side that makes him a fascinating watch. His unending thirst for his third title, his predilection for the odd Chinese war proverb and ever-changing facial hair gives you close to the full package</p>\n<p>3) <strong>Kimi Raikkonen</strong> – The &quot;Ice Man&quot; paradoxically is one of the grid’s biggest personalities because he says so little. A great upholder of F1’s dying party spirit, the &quot;Flying Finn&quot; cares not a jot what the media, or anyone else for that matter, thinks of him.

In fact, those expecting the Scot to fall flat on his face while occupying arguably one of the biggest jobs in club football are in for a rather long wait!</p>\n<p>On Saturday I watched first hand as the reigning English Premier League champions recorded their first home league win – a 2-0 victory over newly promoted Crystal Palace – under their new head coach. It wasn't pretty but it didn't need to be. </p>\n<p>As the legendary Alex Ferguson himself looked on from the Directors' box, Moyes spoke of his &quot;relief&quot; that three points had been secured with relative ease. He was also presumably very happy indeed to move on from the ridiculous over-reaction to his team's first and only defeat of the new season so far, a narrow one-nil reversal at arch -rival Liverpool. </p>\n<p>Like his predecessor – Moyes clearly thrives on pressure and the &quot;siege mentality&quot; Ferguson so often spoke about will also be a big factor during the former Everton boss' tenure. Moyes has already proved he's very much his own man. He didn't cave in when some sections of the British media clamoured for him to sell Wayne Rooney to Chelsea.</p>\n<p>He stood his ground, didn't budge and the Englishman stayed put. Now United may or may not have missed out on certain other transfer window targets but this for me was the smartest &quot;signing&quot; of them all. For the Champions to keep one of their biggest names out of the clutches of their London rivals was huge and the manager must take immense credit for that. </p>\n<p>For some his purchase of Belgium midfielder Marouane Fellaini was a panic buy, a player that was deemed to be not the one they needed. But the tall 25-year-old with the fuzzy hairdo was Moyes' stated pre – season target all along.</p>\n<p>Yes, United still need a fair slice of creative flair to enhance their midfield but they also needed an &quot;enforcer&quot;. Someone who'll get stuck in, run until he drops and with a proven eye for goal. Now they have that. And judging by the amount of wigs on show both inside and outside the crowd on match, day he's already proving one hugely popular signing with the Red Devils faithful.</p>\n<p>Make no mistake Moyes will be given time to succeed, both he and United are in it together for the long haul. Why else would the Old Trafford hierarchy entrust him with a whopping six-year deal? Don't forget higher- profile names than he wanted the job but it was the then Toffees' boss who was hand- picked by Ferguson. And how often was his judgement for potential proved wrong?</p>\n<p>I fully expect Moyes to add to the Community Shield he's already bagged this season. United are the most successful club in English FA Cup history but haven't won it in almost ten long years. </p>\n<p>They're desperate to change that and it wouldn't surprise me one little bit if he delivers that too in his first season in charge. A good showing in the Europe will be expected as well but I believe it's the Premier league that remains the club's absolute priority. I won't jinx him by stating here and now United will retain their title this season but the Reds remain the team to beat, Fergie or no Fergie. </p>\n<br> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/cnniworldsport.wordpress.com/9653/\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/cnniworldsport.wordpress.com/9653/\" border=\"0\"></a> <img height=\"1\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=worldsport.blogs.cnn.com&blog=8188608&post=9653&subd=cnniworldsport&ref=&feed=1\" border=\"0\"><img height=\"1\" width=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/rss/edition_worldsportblog/~4/fp005oFbaWU\">","direction":"ltr"},"updated":1379334788000,"published":1379331188000,"title":"Why United remain England's team to beat ...","alternate":[{"href":"http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_worldsportblog/~3/fp005oFbaWU/","type":"text/html"}],"canonical":[{"href":"http://worldsport.blogs.cnn.com/2013/09/16/why-united-remain-englands-team-to-beat/","type":"text/html"}],"summary":{"content":"His detractors likely won't want to hear this but reports of David Moyes' Old Trafford demise are extremely premature.

I don’t know.”</p>\n<p>Was he at least aware that people loved him so much, I wondered?</p>\n<p>“Well, everyone has fans,” he considered. “I don’t know the reason – but we’d rather have them than not.”</p>\n<div><a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/video/data/2.0/video/sports/2013/09/12/spc-f1-wyatt-ferrari-kimi-raikkonen.cnn.html\">Click to watch video</a></div>\n<p>It is partly this enigmatic quality – Raikkonen’s desire not to give too much away – that makes him so appealing.</p>\n<p>The 33-year-old simply does not say that much, refusing to play the game of media patter and cut-and-paste public relations when he is at the race tracks.</p>\n<p>Occasionally, when he does speak his mind, he provides an unforgettable golden nugget of a quote.</p>\n<p>He once famously answered a question from British TV presenter and ex-F1 driver Martin Brundle <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MlsMVzrp2o\">by explaining that he had just relieved himself in the bathroom</a> – or words to that effect.</p>\n<p>Raikkonen’s instruction on the pit-to-car radio as he drove to victory for Lotus in the 2012 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix also became an instant classic.</p>\n<p>The slogan – “Just leave me alone. I know what I’m doing” – soon appeared on t-shirts and mugs.</p>\n<p>Raikkonen’s idol is 1976 world champion James Hunt – a party-loving playboy who lit up F1 with his flamboyant style – and so it is no surprise that, just occasionally, Ferrari’s new signing has also shown signs of his own could-not-care-less attitude.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2013/09/11/sport/motorsport/formula-one-raikkonen-ferrari-2014/\">Read: Kimi Raikkonen returns to Ferrari</a></p>\n<p>When the 2009 Malaysian Grand Prix was red-flagged because of heavy rain, Raikkonen got out of the car, peeled off his race suit and was shown on television eating an ice cream in the Ferrari motorhome!</p>\n<p>For the last two years, his current team Lotus has kept a ready supply of ice creams at its track headquarters, so Ferrari will now need to get the gelato on order.</p>\n<p>Videos showing Raikkonen <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBMRsY_UI4E\">falling off the roof of a yacht and then getting stuck in the vessel's railings</a>, and another of him <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGvoGqB-j_U\">causing an autograph-hunting child to cry by accidentally bumping him with his bag</a>, are also hugely popular on YouTube.</p>\n<p>It is these glimpses of naughty behavior that have cultivated the cult of Kimi.</p>\n<p>The monosyllabic interviewee, the ice cream guzzler, the man who likes a good time are all, however, just facets of Raikkonen’s persona.</p>\n<p>Ferrari has re-signed him to drive alongside Fernando Alonso knowing that this is part of the package but the Italian team, just like his fans, also admires him for another reason – his fearless racing instincts and hunger for success.</p>\n<p>If the &quot;Prancing Horse&quot; needed a reminder of what both its 2014 drivers can do, the 2005 Japanese Grand Prix is prime evidence.</p>\n<p>Raikkonen won the race for McLaren from 17th on the grid but both he and Alonso – world champion that year for Renault – pulled off some nailbiting passes in what is rated as one of the greatest F1 races of all time.</p>\n<p>Raikkonen recently proved his talents have not faded with time.</p>\n<p>At March’s season-opening Australian Grand Prix, he moved up from seventh on the grid and managed his pace and his tires to pip Alonso to victory.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2013/03/17/sport/motorsport/f1-australian-grand-prix\">Read: Raikkonen claims easy win in Australia</a></p>\n<p>Fellow Finnish F1 driver Heikki Kovalainen believes that it is Raikkonen’s inability to change both on and off the track that makes him so watchable.</p>\n<p>“He was clearly quick and talented,” the Caterham team's development driver, who used to compete against Raikkonen in go-karts in their junior career, told CNN.</p>\n<p>“He was a fighter. He never gave up.</p>\n<p>“I knew his Dad, I know his Mum and his brother – it’s just that Kimi has not changed. He’s always been like that and it’s great.”</p>\n<p>And finally, after a bit more gentle questioning, the man himself agreed that it is probably his ability to be himself – in spite of his success – that people find so appealing.</p>\n<p>“I do my own stuff and I feel it’s the best for me,” Raikkonen finally told me.</p>\n<p>“If somebody thinks it’s good then fine but for sure there are people who don’t like it – but I’m not here to try to please people.”</p>\n<p>Raikkonen may not set out to be a pleaser but it is ironically because of that attitude that he can look forward to 2014 not only as a Ferrari driver, but as perhaps the most popular racer on the grid.</p>\n<br> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/cnniworldsport.wordpress.com/9632/\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/cnniworldsport.wordpress.com/9632/\" border=\"0\"></a> <img height=\"1\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=worldsport.blogs.cnn.com&blog=8188608&post=9632&subd=cnniworldsport&ref=&feed=1\" border=\"0\"><img height=\"1\" width=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/rss/edition_worldsportblog/~4/Zx3Td8nBTmg\">","direction":"ltr"},"updated":1378991649000,"crawled":1378988085343,"alternate":[{"href":"http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_worldsportblog/~3/Zx3Td8nBTmg/","type":"text/html"}],"published":1378988049000,"canonical":[{"href":"http://worldsport.blogs.cnn.com/2013/09/12/the-cult-of-kimi-raikkonen-f1s-coolest-driver/","type":"text/html"}],"author":"tommcgowan","origin":{"htmlUrl":"http://worldsport.blogs.cnn.com","title":"CNN World Sport","streamId":"feed/http://rss.cnn.com/rss/edition_worldsportblog.rss"},"summary":{"content":"Kimi Raikkonen has always been box office, even before he re-signed for Formula One’s most iconic team, Ferrari.

Boris and Pete were baseline players, they were attacking players and they could do it against baseliners like Mats Wilander or Andre Agassi. \n<p>Now that was entertainment. You never knew which way it was going to go.\n<p>Nadal and Djokovic are exceptional athletes, there’s no doubt about it, but to say they are better athletes than past greats like Bjorn Borg and Stefan Edberg is just nonsense.\n<p>This is some crap drummed up by somebody and I think it’s an insult to past players. Modern players don’t dive around the net, they don’t deliver backhand smashes, they don’t have to twist and turn like past generations.\n<p>Could modern players do that? We don’t know. What we do know is that they are incredibly good at retrieving shots from the back of the court. \n<p>Are they better, quicker, more agile around the net? The answer to that would be no.\n<div><a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/video/data/2.0/video/sports/2013/09/11/intv-rafa-nadal-us-open-win.cnn.html\">Click to watch video</a></div>\n<p>What today’s players do around the baseline is undeniably phenomenal. They have become specialists in that, but to say they are better athletes is disrespectful. I don’t buy it at all, not for one second. \n<p>The ITF and the ATP are doing a great job of marketing the game, but they need to look at what is actually happening on the court.\n<p>Is this entertainment? Is this good enough? \n<p>What is beyond question is that Nadal is the top man in tennis right now. \n<p>The new U.S. Open champion’s run of 22 straight hard-court victories will surely see him become the world No. 1 by the end of the year. It’s been an impressive comeback from a serious knee injury.\n<p>Nadal could even go on to eclipse Roger Federer’s record total of 17 grand slams – Rafa currently has 13 – but I think a lot of emphasis is put on records. \n<p>Players don’t go on court thinking of breaking somebodies record, the record books don’t tell the whole story. \n<p>History will show that Nadal won two grand slams in 2013. It won’t show that he was out for seven months before that, which really puts his achievement into perspective.\n<p>I’m not a huge reader of the stats, I never have been. But the Spaniard has won the Olympic title, he’s won the Davis Cup and he’s won all of the grand slams. That’s a pretty solid argument to say he is a better player than Federer.\n<p>He must be a better player than Federer, he keeps beating him all of the time. He’s got a huge winning record over Roger, winning 21 of their 31 matches. Looking at the head-to-head, Rafa is the better player.\n<p>But who is the better player to watch? Who is the better all-round player? You can argue that until the cows come home. \n<p>Federer is my favorite player to watch, but there is no denying the battles between Rafa and Novak Djokovic have been incredible. This is a rivalry that could run and run.\n<p>The problem is they both have very similar styles of play, the two of them play almost identical tennis. \n<p>In terms of pure baseline quality it’s hard to better these guys, but I like to see a contrast.\n<p>Human beings love variety. We don’t want to watch the same style of play, we don’t want to watch the same shots all of the time. Players have got to mix it up.\n<p>Almost every modern player has the same tactics, which some use better than others. We rightly celebrate these great matches between Nadal and Djokovic, but we need to look at the bigger picture.\n<br> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/cnniworldsport.wordpress.com/9626/\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/cnniworldsport.wordpress.com/9626/\" border=\"0\"></a> <img height=\"1\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=worldsport.blogs.cnn.com&blog=8188608&post=9626&subd=cnniworldsport&ref=&feed=1\" border=\"0\"><img height=\"1\" width=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/rss/edition_worldsportblog/~4/R2i5KyvLau0\">","direction":"ltr"},"canonical":[{"href":"http://worldsport.blogs.cnn.com/2013/09/11/are-rafael-nadal-and-novak-djokovic-boring/","type":"text/html"}],"enclosure":[{"href":"http://i0.wp.com/i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/130911153654-rafael-nadal-blog-tease-story-top.jpg?resize=120%2C68","length":28800,"type":"image/jpeg"}],"author":"tommcgowan","origin":{"htmlUrl":"http://worldsport.blogs.cnn.com","title":"CNN World Sport","streamId":"feed/http://rss.cnn.com/rss/edition_worldsportblog.rss"},"summary":{"content":"There’s an argument that this generation of men's tennis is boring and I think it’s a valid one.

We don’t have the same mentality as the Dutch. They have quality, but they speak about it as well.

One of Bruyninckx’s close confidants Dirk Gyselinckx is working with the Anderlecht youth teams which have been dominating at both national and international level.\n<p>“Anderlecht have won five of the eight national youth championships and many important European tournaments such as the Viareggio, the Aegon Future Cup and the Premier League Cup,” added Bruyninckx.\n<p>“The integration of many very young players in the first team is the proof of the success of what has happened in Belgium. Most of all Yoeri Tielemans, the 16 year-old player, who has surprised the whole of Belgium and is the product of the new strategy.”\n<p>Riga stressed that while the Belgian Federation had looked at the way other nations developed players, it had not simply “copied and pasted” what had worked in those countries.\n<p>“There’s no point in copying Spain,\" said Riga. \"The education system is different as is the weather and culture, but it is good to open your eyes and try to understand these approaches.”\n<p>The former Standard Liege coach also warned that Belgium must not rest on its laurels.\n<p>“It’s a never ending story,\" added Riga. \"You have to constantly search for the evolution of football. The coach has to anticipate the future game and if you want to have some advantages you have to try and anticipate to find the key to football success.”\n<br> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/cnniworldsport.wordpress.com/9608/\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/cnniworldsport.wordpress.com/9608/\" border=\"0\"></a> <img height=\"1\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=worldsport.blogs.cnn.com&blog=8188608&post=9608&subd=cnniworldsport&ref=&feed=1\" border=\"0\"><img height=\"1\" width=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/rss/edition_worldsportblog/~4/Ly56crit1KA\">","direction":"ltr"},"updated":1378810464000,"alternate":[{"href":"http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_worldsportblog/~3/Ly56crit1KA/","type":"text/html"}],"canonical":[{"href":"http://worldsport.blogs.cnn.com/2013/09/10/will-belgium-win-the-world-cup/","type":"text/html"}],"summary":{"content":"No. But the fact that a nation with a population of just 11 million people is being mentioned as World Cup dark horses is nothing short of remarkable given Belgium have failed to qualify for their last five major tournaments.

Then when you hear them, they are so pumped up it is though they have been racing a car at well over a hundred miles an hour.\n<p>All editions of the America's Cup have criticism and controversy - but this one has had more than most.\n<p>It started with the tragedy, when Andrew Simpson lost his life in a training accident. After his death, everyone was watching the boats and thinking that there would be another horrendous crash and that someone else would die - but I think most people have stopped thinking like that now.\n<div><a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/video/?/video/sports/2013/07/12/mainsail-andrew-simpson-death-b.cnn\">Click to watch video</a></div>\n<p>It's by no means forgotten, especially by those in the sailing community, but we can now see how the boats are being sailed so well, which is no easy thing, and that the teams look comfortable. \n<p>A few months of practice have passed and they have more and more confidence that they can sail the machines hard. I think the two teams are pretty exceptional.\n<p>Before it began, the general consensus was that one team would walk away with the competition but that is not how it is turning out. \n<p>Traditionally, the first day of the America's Cup tells you everything but even though Team NZ won both races on Saturday, I think this competition will be slightly different by not being so clear cut.\n<p>Since the defending champions do not compete in the Louis Vuitton challenger series, Oracle have not had so much competition and so are still learning how to race - whereas the Kiwis have had the whole summer of racing. \n<p>By Sunday afternoon though, when Oracle won their first race by eight seconds to trail 1-3, they had definitely improved. They are not slower, just not quite as polished.\n<p>I think that the whole scandal that preceded the start of the race also shook up Oracle far more than you might imagine. The jury took six weeks to make a decision after the initial allegations against them of illegally modifying their boats in a build-up series to the Americas Cup. \n<p>Then the damning verdict came just four days before the first race.\n<p>Docking them two points means they have to win 11 races to win the series, whereas the Kiwis only need nine, and another body blow came when Dirk de Ridder was one of the three team members banned. \n<p>He is a key player, having been with Oracle for a long time and running the accelerator, so they literally lost their wing man with just days to go.\n<div><a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/video/?/video/bestoftv/2013/09/06/exp-erin-pkg-simon-americas-cup-greatest-prize-in-yachting.cnn\">Click to watch video</a></div>\n<p>There are mixed views about the most severe punishment in the competition's 162-year history. Many people think it was harsh but a lot of those in the sailing community do not and feel a fine would have been insufficient. \n<p>Oracle just have to put it out of their mind now as they have to win races, but the decision could easily affect the outcome of the 34th America's Cup. \n<p>I don't think the weather will be so much of a factor though since San Francisco is one of the most reliable places on the planet for being windy.\n<p>Meanwhile, the spectators are loving being so close to the action. \n<p>There are two main areas from where to watch on the shore, one of them at the finish. Normally, you see little as the boats are so far away and there is often a huge exclusion zone as well but since it's a short course, the race fits in the bay so you can see the whites of their eyes as they cross the finish line.\n<p>The people of San Francisco were promised a summer of sailing but until the America's Cup finals began, it has not lived up to expectations. \n<p>In the last few days, everything has changed and it's hard to find anyone saying a bad word about it. Thousands are coming to watch, they are cheering at the big moments and they appear to be loving every second.\n<p>I have a feeling it's just going to get better and better...\n<br> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/cnniworldsport.wordpress.com/9590/\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/cnniworldsport.wordpress.com/9590/\" border=\"0\"></a> <img height=\"1\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=worldsport.blogs.cnn.com&blog=8188608&post=9590&subd=cnniworldsport&ref=&feed=1\" border=\"0\"><img height=\"1\" width=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/rss/edition_worldsportblog/~4/rIhorNrEVR0\">","direction":"ltr"},"updated":1378768966000,"crawled":1378765390348,"alternate":[{"href":"http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_worldsportblog/~3/rIhorNrEVR0/","type":"text/html"}],"canonical":[{"href":"http://worldsport.blogs.cnn.com/2013/09/09/flying-machines-elevate-americas-cup-to-new-levels/","type":"text/html"}],"summary":{"content":"The first thing to say about this year's America's Cup between Team Oracle USA and Emirates Team New Zealand is that the racing has been amazing - and it is not often you can say that in sailing.

Have they lost a step here, a few miles an hour off their serve there?\n<p>However, in defiance of her senior status in the game, Serena Williams actually appears to be moving better than she did in her twenties, and as for power, her fastest serve came at this year’s Australian Open, when she clocked 128.6 mph (207.6 kph) - just 0.4 mph shy of her sister Venus' world record.\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2013/09/08/sport/tennis/tennis-us-open-serena-azarenka/index.html\">Read: Serena wins fifth U.S. Open title</a>\n<p>It’s no exaggeration to say that at nearly 32 years old, Serena is physically fitter, technically better, psychologically tougher, and emotionally stronger than at any time during her remarkable career. And her results show it, having won nine titles so far this year, eclipsing her previous best of eight set back in 2002 during the peak of her powers, when she won the first three legs of the Serena Slam.\n<p>The second biggest factor in determining an aging player’s future is the quality of the next generation nipping at their toes.\n<p>When Serena burst onto the scene as a teenager in the late '90s, the women’s tour was overflowing with future Hall of Famers such as Graf, Monica Seles, Martina Hingis, Lindsay Davenport and Arantxa Sanchez Vicario, not to mention her older sister, who was starting to make serious waves in the game.\n<p>In the early 2000s, the depth of competition was equally deep, with Justine Henin, Jennifer Capriati, Kim Clijsters and Venus to contend with. And yet, during these times, Serena was able to carve her own place as one of the dominant players of the era.\n<p>These days her only real threat comes from Victoria Azarenka and, to a lesser extent, Maria Sharapova. And yet, between the two of them they share a combined five wins over Serena in 32 attempts. As for the rest of the world’s top 10, they combine for just four wins over Serena in 38 attempts.\n<div><a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/video/data/2.0/video/sports/2013/06/08/davis-serena-williams-intvw.cnn.html\">Click to watch video</a></div>\n<p>In a nutshell, Serena is in a league above the current crop of contenders.\n<p>For many players her age, burnout is a factor which can a serious impact their ability to continue winning.\n<p>Fortunately for Serena, her tendency in previous years to play an abbreviated schedule, focusing on the major events, with relatively little attention on her ranking, has allowed her to develop a life outside of tennis, including ventures into fashion, business and the entertainment world.\n<p>She has also spent a good deal of time away from the game due to injury. The most recent, and most serious, keeping her away from the game for almost an entire year, during which time she spent time in hospital suffering with potentially life-threatening blood clots in her lungs.\n<p>Faced with the very real possibility that her career could have been over, Serena appears to have returned to the game with a newfound drive. The cliche goes, you don’t know what you’ve got till it’s gone, and for Serena, she seems to now fully appreciate what she has, and is striving to make the most of it.\n<div><a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/video/data/2.0/video/sports/2012/11/22/open-court-serena-williams-pinto-intv.cnn.html\">Click to watch video</a></div>\n<p>With this new focus and appreciation for the game, Serena has already spoken out about her future, more than hinting that she’s already filled out the 2016 Olympics application form, signed the check and mailed it in, guaranteeing she’ll be around for at least another three years.\n<p>Of course, you can expect that at 35, Serena’s inevitable decline in fitness would be unavoidable, but with the best-of-three set format the women’s game plays at grand slams - unlike the men's five - she could probably still compete at the highest level at 70% of the strength and speed she currently exhibits.\n<p>Excluding the year she missed due to injury, Serena has averaged two grand slams a year since late 2008. If she were to continue that trend until the Olympics in 2016, she’ll have accumulated a total of 22, tying Steffi Graf for the most singles majors in the Open era.\n<p>While that seems like a daunting task for any player, identifying a factor which could stop is hard to pin down.\n<p>From here on in, the only obstacle standing between her 22 majors is her own body. She’s not been immune to injury in the past, and no player is ever immune from it in the future.\n<p>If she can stay healthy and manage her schedule well, I don’t see any reason why she cannot continue to win multiple majors each year between now and the Olympics.

Not only did he demand a massive fee  – possibly even a world record – for a player largely untested at the highest level, but he played the European transfer market with all the strategic flair of a chess Grandmaster.<span></span>\n<p>Throughout the summer, I received plenty of messages from fans around the world, telling me that the Welsh winger wasn’t worth anything like the astronomical figures being quoted, and maybe he’s not. But in any market, the value of any commodity  – be it a piece of real estate or a bale of hay  – is only decided by the two negotiators around the table.\n<p>If you want it bad enough, you’ll pay what I say.\n<p>On Sunday, social media sites were alive with armchair micro-analysis of the trade and much of the comment was commending Levy’s role. With his business acumen he should take over as Britain’s finance minister, the narrative went, or with his negotiating skills he should represent terrorist organizations. Clubs who are struggling in the transfer market should just sign Levy ahead of any new players and – apparently  – he never loses at monopoly, because anyone landing on his properties ends up having to pay three times what they’re worth.\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.edition.cnn.com/2013/09/03/sport/football/gareth-bale-real-madrid-british-footballers-abroad/index.html\">Read: Spanish lessons for Gareth Bale</a>\n<p>Bale was by far and away Tottenham’s best player last season, swaggering his way to three individual player awards and scoring 26 goals, none of which were tap-ins – many of which were 30-yard netbusters. Spurs didn’t have to sell their prize asset and nor did they particularly want to, but having just missed out on Champions League qualification for a third year in four, and with Bale already seduced by the idea of a dream move to Spain, the time was now right to make the most of an opportunity.\n<p>England’s top three teams changed their managers in the summer, a perfect time for Spurs to strike. Aided and abetted by his new director of football Franco Baldini, Levy identified several key targets early on, quickly sewing up deals for Paulinho, Roberto Soldado, Etienne Capoue and Nacer Chadli. While English Premier League rivals Arsenal and Manchester United were idling in the market, Spurs were organized and decisive, breaking their own transfer record – twice.\n<div><a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/video/data/2.0/video/sports/2013/09/02/gareth-bale-transfer-madrid-goodman.cnn.html\">Click to watch video</a></div>\n<p>Levy wasn’t finished. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.edition.cnn.com/2013/08/28/sport/football/football-willian-chelsea-bale/index.html\">Chelsea may have snatched Willian from under his nose</a>, but he broke the club’s record transfer fee for a third time in just a matter of weeks by landing the Bale-esque Erik Lamela, and he also signed Christian Eriksen and Vlad Chiriches  – all while Bale remained a Tottenham player.\n<p>A world record deal was \"imminent\" for the last fortnight of August, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.edition.cnn.com/2013/09/01/sport/football/gareth-bale-transfer-real-madrid-football/index.html\">but it didn’t actually go through until the penultimate day of the window.</a>\n<p>Naturally Tottenham wanted to have their own targets under contract, but in assessing the landscape around him, Levy was particularly shrewd. He knew that Real would unload several players to accommodate Bale’s arrival, but they couldn’t risk doing so until they knew he was coming for sure.\n<p>It just so happens that Arsenal wanted to sign one or both of Real's Angel di Maria and Mesut Ozil. By holding on until last Friday it meant they couldn’t get them before the North London derby against Spurs on Sunday, after which the Bale deal was finally confirmed.\n<p>Levy knows very well that Arsenal represent arguably the biggest threat to his club's aspirations of a top-four finish. In the end, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.edition.cnn.com/2013/09/02/sport/football/transfer-deadline-day-bale-ozil-football/index.html\">the Gunners got Ozil on deadline day</a> but we may never know if they could have had more.\n<p>I interviewed Levy for World Sport a few years ago; it was a rare chance to speak with the 51-year-old, who prefers to keep a low profile in the media. His record isn’t perfect, but he’s learned from his mistakes. He thoroughly frustrated Madrid when they last went after one of his players, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.edition.cnn.com/2012/08/27/sport/football/modric-tottenham-real-madrid-football/index.html\">making them pay through the nose for Luka Modric in late August 2012</a>, and he had no hesitation in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.edition.cnn.com/2012/06/14/sport/football/redknapp-tottenham-manager-football/index.html\">cutting manager Harry Redknapp adrift when he became too greedy in his contract negotiations.</a>\n<p>Levy doesn’t take kindly to anyone who pushes him too hard on a deal. When Real had the arrogance to build a stage upon which they were going to parade Bale, Levy made them take it down – nothing had yet been signed.\n<p>Of course it all counts for naught if Spurs again fail to push on up the table before mixing with Europe’s elite in the Champions League. But there is only so much a chairman can do. It’s now up to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.edition.cnn.com/2012/07/03/sport/football/football-tottenham-villas-boas/index.html\">manager Andre Villas Boas</a> and the men on the field to follow their chairman’s example: don’t take any prisoners and make sure you’re not the first to blink.\n<br> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/cnniworldsport.wordpress.com/9570/\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/cnniworldsport.wordpress.com/9570/\" border=\"0\"></a> <img height=\"1\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=worldsport.blogs.cnn.com&blog=8188608&post=9570&subd=cnniworldsport&ref=&feed=1\" border=\"0\"><img height=\"1\" width=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/rss/edition_worldsportblog/~4/3xtbRN8aetU\">","direction":"ltr"},"published":1378379505000,"title":"Daniel Levy: Football's toughest negotiator?","updated":1378383670000,"crawled":1378380092239,"alternate":[{"href":"http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_worldsportblog/~3/3xtbRN8aetU/","type":"text/html"}],"canonical":[{"href":"http://worldsport.blogs.cnn.com/2013/09/05/daniel-levy-footballs-toughest-negotiator/","type":"text/html"}],"summary":{"content":"Gareth Bale may have been the big star of Europe's summer transfer window, but behind the scenes it was his former club chairman Daniel Levy who emerged as one of the most formidable characters.

The transfer window, from the point of view of managers and coaches, is all about improving your side’s stock. Some traders proved better than others as the clock ticked down in the final 24 hours (marked out of 10) … \n<p><strong>Real Madrid:</strong><br>\n<strong>Stock +9</strong><br>\nThe raising of stock is about perception over on-pitch reality. Many would argue that losing the assist-making talents of Mesut Ozil and creativity of Kaka is a blow to Los Blancos, but Real are past-masters at creating lucrative new legends. The signing of Welsh attacker Gareth Bale* for more money than most small countries are worth bolsters their prestige domestically and maintains their allure globally. He’s a superb talent to boot and combined with midfielder Asier Illarramendi and forward Isco, among others, coach Carlo Ancelotti would be forgiven for feeling rather smug. Cue the raising of a satisfied eyebrow. (*Not strictly a final-day deal but it was too close and too big not to mention).\n<p><a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2013/09/01/sport/football/gareth-bale-real-madrid-record-transfer-deal-football/\">Read: Real Madrid doesn't do austerity</a>\n<p><strong>Arsenal:</strong><br>\n<strong>Stock + 8</strong><br>\nAmazing how the signing of one player can change the psychology of a club. Gunners’ fans had craved a statement of ambition from manager Arsene Wenger after seeing top players sold in successive seasons and a persistent drought of silverware. Smashing the club transfer fee on German attacking midfielder Ozil was a great way to placate the dissenters and to buy more time for a side that actually is in very good shape, despite its squad being young and lacking Galactico superstars. Extra points for beating rivals Paris Saint-Germain and Manchester United to the signing; Goalkeeper Emiliano Viviano is a shrewd capture too. \n<p><strong>AC Milan:</strong><br>\n<strong>Stock + 6</strong><br>\nThe challenge for the Rossoneri is to maintain their imperious record of success in an era where money is tighter for the Serie A giants. Canny wheeler-dealing has never been more important. The signing of Brazil’s Kaka was a cracking deal, bringing the 31-year-old back to the side where he won the Champions League and Scudetto on a free transfer despite selling the 2007 World Player of the Year to Real for $87 million in 2009. His career needs a jump start and where better to rekindle his mojo than Milanello? Top marks to AC Milan chief executive Adriano Galliani and coach Massimiliano Allegri. \n<p><strong>Man City: </strong><br>\n<strong>Stock +3 </strong><br>\nThe final day of the transfer window was one of exits for City, with manager Manuel Pellegrini allowing the likes of midfielders Gareth Barry and Abdul Razak as well as striker Harry Bunn to take up season-long loans. Martin Demichelis was the only arrival, the 32-year-old Argentine defender joining from Atletico Madrid. It’s a measure of the strength of the backroom set up at Eastlands now that technical director Txiki Begiristain helped to tie up the transfer deals for forwards Stevan Jovetic and Alvaro Negredo, midfielder Fernandinho and defender Jesus Navas well before the deadline. The challenge for Pellegrini will be making the new faces gel quickly.\n<p><a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2013/09/03/sport/football/gareth-bale-real-madrid-british-footballers-abroad/\">Read: Gareth Bale looks to avoid curse of Brits abroad</a>\n<p><strong>Atletico Madrid:</strong><br>\n<strong>Stock + 1</strong><br>\nDespite losing Demichelis to City, Atletico moved quickly to replace any shortage at the back. Belgium’s robust defender Toby Alderweireld joined from Ajax after the 24-year-old signed a four-year-deal while Frenchman Joshua Guilavogui – a 22-year-old defensive midfielder – left St Etienne for the Spanish capital. Atletico coach Diego Simone showed he would not be caught on the hop as time ran out.\n<p><strong>Juventus</strong><br>\n<strong>Stock +0.5</strong><br>\nA quiet day for Juventus coach Antonio Conte saw just the loan signing of Mbaye Diagne. The 21-year-old striker from Ivory Coast is hardly a stellar name, but the earlier acquisitions of defender Angelo Ogbonna from city-rivals Torino and striker Carlos Tevez from Manchester City gives Juve a fighting chance of retaining their 2013 league title.\n<p><strong>Barcelona / Bayern / Dortmund / Bayer Leverkusen / Real Sociedad / Schalke:<br>\nStock 0</strong><br>\nNo deals \n<p><strong>Napoli:</strong><br>\n<strong>Stock -1</strong><br>\nFormer Liverpool left back Andrea Dossena was allowed to leave the Italian outfit for Sunderland, after failing to secure a move to Torino last week. Napoli head coach Rafael Benitez was happy to add to Sunderland’s 14-man recruitment drive over the last few months thanks to a successful drive of his own. With striker Gonzalo Higuain, goalkeeper Pepe Reina, defender Raul Albiol and striker Jose Maria Callejon, among others, joining last year’s Serie A second placers, Benitez will be keen to test his mettle for the title this time around.\n<p><a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2013/09/02/sport/football/transfer-deadline-day-bale-ozil-football/\">Read: Transfer deadline day as it happened </a>\n<p><strong>Marseille:</strong><br>\n<strong>Stock – 1</strong><br>\nPremier League side West Bromwich Albion signed 28-year-old midfielder Morgan Amalfitano in a season-long loan deal from the 2012-13 Ligue 1 runners up. Despite the minor loss, Marseille supporters will feel confident for the season ahead following the acquisitions of midfielder Florian Thauvin and winger Dimitri Payet from Lille as well as midfielders Gianelli Imbula and Mario Lemina. And there couldn’t be a better time to bolster the ranks for the European champions of 1993 given the growing power and ambition of PSG and Monaco. \n<p><strong>PSG:</strong><br>\n<strong>Stock -2</strong><br>\nDefender Mamadou Sakho left Paris for Liverpool in a deal thought to be worth around £18m. The 23-year-old, who has been capped 14 times by Les Bleus, was seen as a marquee signing by the Anfield side and is something of a loss. \n<p>Not that coach Laurent Blanc will lose much sleep over it. His ranks have been strengthened by such luminaries as striker Edinson Cavani (from Napoli), as well as defender Marquinhos (Roma) and Lucas Digne (Lille) in a splurge in excess of $100m by the Qatari-owned outfit during the transfer window. Blanc’s fears will be focused on living up to the expectation.\n<p><strong>Chelsea:</strong><br>\n<strong>Stock -3</strong><br>\nChelsea manager Jose Mourinho’s performance on the last day of the transfer window was completely lacking in drama. Despite an audacious bid for United striker Wayne Rooney earlier in the month, the London side were left to manage which players would be allowed to leave to help balance the books. Strikers Romelu Lukaku and Victor Moses, who joined Everton and Liverpool on season-long loans respectively, exited Stamford Bridge reducing the stock of the side on the day. Fans will have no worries though with striker Samuel Eto’o, winger Christian Atsu (who was promptly loaned to Vitesse Arnhem), as well attacking midfielders Willian and Andre Schurrle among others bolstering an already formidable side. \n<p><strong>Manchester United: </strong><br>\n<strong>Stock -9 </strong><br>\nThe transfer market was always going to be a stern early test of manager David Moyes’ leadership but few would have predicted quite how poorly the Scot and chief Ed Woodward would fare. The last-minute signing of midfielder Marouane Fellaini from his former club Everton was the bare minimum expected for a side in dire need of midfield reinforcements. Without that deal the window would have been a complete catastrophe for a club anxious about maintaining its prestige. The public snub by Barcelona midfielder Cesc Fabregas to United’s wooing was embarrassing; missing out on the cost saving Fellaini’s buy-out clause offered was baffling but to see defender Fabio Coentrao and midfielder Ander Herrara deals fail because of time running out looked amateurish for one of the world’s biggest clubs. Moyes knows he must do better next time around.\n<br> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/cnniworldsport.wordpress.com/9560/\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/cnniworldsport.wordpress.com/9560/\" border=\"0\"></a> <img height=\"1\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=worldsport.blogs.cnn.com&blog=8188608&post=9560&subd=cnniworldsport&ref=&feed=1\" border=\"0\"><img height=\"1\" width=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/rss/edition_worldsportblog/~4/0EzUgDUCmyM\">","direction":"ltr"},"updated":1378228037000,"published":1378224437000,"title":"Football’s winners and losers of the last-day transfer dash …","crawled":1378224464860,"alternate":[{"href":"http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_worldsportblog/~3/0EzUgDUCmyM/","type":"text/html"}],"canonical":[{"href":"http://worldsport.blogs.cnn.com/2013/09/03/footballs-winners-and-losers-of-the-last-day-transfer-dash/","type":"text/html"}],"enclosure":[{"href":"http://i1.wp.com/i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2013/images/09/03/deadline.day.blog.jpg?resize=120%2C68","length":28800,"type":"image/jpeg"}],"author":"tommcgowan","origin":{"htmlUrl":"http://worldsport.blogs.cnn.com","title":"CNN World Sport","streamId":"feed/http://rss.cnn.com/rss/edition_worldsportblog.rss"},"summary":{"content":"In a bid to make the assessment of the transfer deadline day activity more manageable, let’s take a look at how Champions League clubs from the top divisions in Europe - the English Premier League, the Bundesliga, La Liga and Serie A - fared.

By doing so, the 17-time grand slam champion risks diminishing his historic legacy - <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2013/09/02/sport/tennis/tennis-us-open-federer/index.html\">a prospect further raised by his fourth-round defeat against Tommy Robredo at the U.S. Open.</a><span></span>\n<p>So when is the right time to walk away from a Hall of Fame career?\n<p>Eight-time grand slam winner Jimmy Connors continued almost a decade after dropping from the No. 1 spot, and in doing so managed to win over a brand new generation of fans with his heroic runs at the U.S. Open into his late 30s.\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.edition.cnn.com/2013/08/25/sport/tennis/roger-federer-us-open-bollettieri-tennis/index.html\">Read: Federer 'is vulnerable' at U.S. Open</a>\n<p>But Roger Federer isn’t Jimmy Connors. Federer isn’t known for his tenacious fighting or dogged drag-down, in-your-face, never-say-die style of play, the way a Connors or a Rafael Nadal is. He’s an artist. A magician. If a fighter goes down swinging, it enhances their mythology, but for a magician to continue long after they’ve lost the sleight of hand only serves to hurt them.\n<p>Paradoxically, less successful athletes can be commended for their resilience late in their career, such as tennis veteran Tommy Haas’ recent resurgence into the top 20 more than a decade after he reached No. 2 in the world.\n<p>However, the German - three years older than Federer at 35 - isn’t hampered by having to defend a legacy. Having overcome some serious injuries, he can now play for himself and for his fans. Federer, on the other hand, represents an era, and in many respects, the history of the game, and as such is responsible for retiring in a manner worthy of what he has achieved.\n<p>This predicament exists in all sports. Legendary Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson waited until he had his 13th English Premier League title in his hand and enough weeks left in the fixture list to adequately say goodbye before walking away from his remarkable football career. While he would have preferred a Champions League title in his final season, the 71-year-old would have recognized the optimal timing of stepping aside on top, and took it.\n<div><a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/video/data/2.0/video/sports/2013/08/25/ws-nick-bollettieri-us-open-mens-preview.cnn.html\">Click to watch video</a></div>\n<p>For Federer's fellow tennis legend Pete Sampras, the timing of his retirement was perfect. At the 2002 U.S. Open final, he defeated his arch nemesis and compatriot Andre Agassi on the very court where he had claimed the first of his 14 grand slam titles 12 years earlier against the very same opponent. He left the court that day and never returned, making it the perfect climax to a blockbuster career.\n<p>But how can Federer match that?\n<p>Well, he did.\n<p>The perfect time for Federer to retire came after his remarkable 2012 Wimbledon triumph. There he was granted the opportunity to finish his career in a Sampras-esque fashion, calling it a day at the historic home of the game, where he had first shot to fame defeating the American back in 2001, and where two years later he claimed his first grand slam title.\n<p>However, there were two issues with retiring there and then. Firstly, the win saw Federer reclaim the world No. 1 ranking, which is a pretty tall perch from which to jump.\n<p>Secondly, and certainly of greater import, the Olympic Games were less than a month away, and to be played at Wimbledon, providing a tantalizing opportunity to win the one title that had escaped him, on the court where he was the undisputed king.\n<p>He eventually fell one match short of Olympic gold, and in doing so, missed yet another opportunity to retire in style. It forced him to wait for a third, and perhaps final chance to go out on top.\n<p>Earlier this month Federer turned 32, and while many players have won grand slams after the age of 30, recent examples are few and far between. Most notably, Sampras was 31 when he won the 2002 U.S. Open, and Agassi was 32 when he claimed the 2003 Australian Open.\n<div><a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/video/data/2.0/video/sports/2012/03/29/open-court-pete-samprass.cnn.html\">Click to watch video</a></div>\n<p>Heading into those events, Sampras had contested 977 ATP Tour career matches, and Agassi 986. In contrast, Federer headed into the 2013 U.S. Open with 1,119 ATP Tour career matches under his belt. That’s over 130 more matches, or roughly two full years on the tour. That is a big difference.\n<p>Equally, Agassi’s 2003 Melbourne triumph came without facing a single top-10 player or grand slam champion. These days, to win a major one must defeat at least two of the big guns in the game, often in back-to-back matches.\n<p>With all this in mind, not to mention his recent less-than-stellar form, it’s simply hard to imagine the once unbeatable Roger Federer can still win grand slam titles. However, if the past tells us anything, it’s that writing off Federer only seems to drive him harder.\n<p>Back in 2008, Nadal surpassed him at the top of the rankings and seemed to have his number on all surfaces, leaving many to speculate that Federer would never again reach No. 1. After a year chasing the Spaniard, he was back on top.\n<p>Again, in 2011 Novak Djokovic looked invincible, forcing Federer into unfamiliar territory as the fourth-ranked player in the world, but by the end of the season he was back on track to reclaiming the No. 1 ranking, eventually surpassing Sampras' record for most weeks at the top after claiming his 17th grand slam at the Wimbledon.\n<p>Therefore if for no other reason, I implore you, I welcome you, please join me one and all in collectively writing off Roger Federer. Hopefully it works, and the greatest player of all time is afforded one last opportunity to step away as a grand slam champion.\n<br> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/cnniworldsport.wordpress.com/9552/\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/cnniworldsport.wordpress.com/9552/\" border=\"0\"></a> <img height=\"1\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=worldsport.blogs.cnn.com&blog=8188608&post=9552&subd=cnniworldsport&ref=&feed=1\" border=\"0\"><img height=\"1\" width=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/rss/edition_worldsportblog/~4/OFiXf7Oshac\">","direction":"ltr"},"published":1378205721000,"title":"When should Federer walk away from tennis?","updated":1378209321000,"crawled":1378205752535,"alternate":[{"href":"http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_worldsportblog/~3/OFiXf7Oshac/","type":"text/html"}],"canonical":[{"href":"http://worldsport.blogs.cnn.com/2013/09/03/when-should-federer-walk-away-from-tennis/","type":"text/html"}],"summary":{"content":"After his worst summer in a decade, Roger Federer now stands at the unfamiliar intersection between one of the greatest careers in tennis history, if not sporting history, and a precarious future as a potential also-ran in the upper echelons of the game.

However, in the United States, collegiate football, also known as NCAA football, is just as popular as its professional counterpart.\n<p>Unlike the NFL where there are only 32 teams across the country, collegiate football has more than 120 teams. This means every area across the country has a local team they can identify with. For instance, while the Dallas Cowboys may be the most popular team in the NFL, there is the same, if not more support for Texas, Texas A&amp;M or Texas Tech’s football teams.\n<p>Since it’s inception in 1906, the collegiate system has insisted on keeping its athletes amateur, forcing student athletes to rely fully on their scholarships to get them through their college days. \n<p>The ideal of amateurism may have started with the best intentions, but in the past 10 years, it has caused severe consequences for some of the NCAA’s biggest programs and players.\n<p>Most recently the NCAA’s best returning player, Johnny Manziel, faced an investigation for allegedly receiving payments for autographs he signed, an action that could have potentially forced him to sit out the entire upcoming season. \n<p>After a six-hour hearing, the NCAA determined that there was no evidence that Manziel received payments for autographs, but he did violate rules regarding the signing of certain autographs and declared him ineligible to start the season for one half of the first game.\n<p>“Student athletes are often asked for autographs from fans, but unfortunately, some individuals’ sole motivation in seeking an autograph is for resale,\" said NCAA Vice President of Academic and Membership Affairs Kevin Lennon after the Manziel ruling.\n<p>\"It is important that schools are cognizant and educate student athletes about situations in which there is a strong likelihood that the autograph seeker plans to resell the items.”\n<p>The Manziel ban is the latest decision made about high-profile NCAA players who have had their amateur status questioned during their collegiate days.\n<p>In 2010, Reggie Bush returned his Heisman trophy, an award given out annually to the NCAA’s best player, after the NCAA concluded he received money from marketing agents while playing at Southern Cal in 2006.\n<p>Throughout the 2010 football season, Auburn quarterback Cam Newton fought allegations that his father solicited schools for up to $180,000. Newtown served a one-day suspension, but never missed any playing time, going on to win the 2010 Heisman Trophy and leading Auburn to a 2011 National Championship win.\n<p>NCAA football is now a big money business. According to ESPN, in 2008 the University of Alabama, one of the premiere programs in the NCAA, had profits of more than $123 million, but its players were not able to see any of that revenue.\n<p>Chris Childers, host of XM Radio’s “College Football Coast-to-Coast”, believes the time is coming for change at the NCAA’s highest level.\n<p>“I think the NCAA needs to be stopped,” Childers told CNN in a recent interview. “I think the NCAA is so broken, so incompetent. The only thing consistent about the NCAA is its inconsistencies.\n<p>“The school athletic departments are making a killing. The NCAA is making a killing. The schools at large are making a killing. \n<p>\"They (the players) deserve something. They’re raking in all this money, and they don’t see any of it. They can’t do anything. They can’t go out on a Saturday night with their buddies or take out their girlfriend. Something has to change.”\n<p>With the NCAA unwilling to adapt, will changes be forced upon it?\n<p>“I think times have changed,\" answered Childers. \"They are so stubborn with their old rules and the way they conduct themselves the hypocrisy is unbelievable.\n<p>“I don’t think they’re losing their amateur status, but I do think we’ll start seeing the kids make a little bit of money off of all the hard work they put it.”\n<p>What Childers is talking about would be total cost of the tuition system, where players would receive a set allowance to give them money to spend outside of their classroom expenses. \n<p>However, the NCAA is not in favor of implementing such a system, according to NCAA Vice President of Communications Bob Williams.\n<p>“As a membership association, our members have not supported the professionalization of college athletics,” Williams said in a statement to CNN.\n<p>“Our 1,110 member schools provide educational opportunities for more than 430,000 student athletes across three divisions. While many think college sports mean big money, less than 30 of these universities actually generate a profit from their athletic programs.”\n<p>Williams says the NCAA gives 96% of their revenue directly back to the schools, and thus the student athletes, to generate more than $2 billion in athletic scholarships.\n<p>These are the same contracted scholarships that restrict the student athletes financially and prevent profiting from their own success.\n<p>While there have been many options thrown around to solve the growing “amateur” problem in NCAA football, one thing is for certain - there needs to be a solution soon before the there is an English Premier League like move away from the NCAA.\n<br> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/cnniworldsport.wordpress.com/9548/\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/cnniworldsport.wordpress.com/9548/\" border=\"0\"></a> <img height=\"1\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=worldsport.blogs.cnn.com&blog=8188608&post=9548&subd=cnniworldsport&ref=&feed=1\" border=\"0\"><img height=\"1\" width=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/rss/edition_worldsportblog/~4/HPJ8T1UhkGs\">","direction":"ltr"},"updated":1378141420000,"published":1378137820000,"title":"American college football faces up to the pressures of professionalism","crawled":1378137855059,"alternate":[{"href":"http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_worldsportblog/~3/HPJ8T1UhkGs/","type":"text/html"}],"canonical":[{"href":"http://worldsport.blogs.cnn.com/2013/09/02/american-college-football-faces-up-to-the-pressures-of-professionalism/","type":"text/html"}],"enclosure":[{"href":"http://i0.wp.com/i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2013/images/09/02/johnny.manziel.jpg?resize=120%2C68","length":28800,"type":"image/jpeg"}],"author":"jsinnottcnn","origin":{"htmlUrl":"http://worldsport.blogs.cnn.com","title":"CNN World Sport","streamId":"feed/http://rss.cnn.com/rss/edition_worldsportblog.rss"},"summary":{"content":"The NFL has cemented itself among the popular sporting leagues in the world thanks to huge events like the Super Bowl and its endeavors to bring the game to the UK.

He told The Associated Press: “I would be very much surprised, more than surprised, if the ExCo will not accept the principle you cannot play in summer in Qatar.”\n<p>Blatter expects a meeting in Zurich on October 3-4 to approve the change, and begin consultation on the best time for Qatar to host the tournament.\n<p>But this is where the fun and games really start.

Frank Lowy, chairman of the Football Federation Australia, said from the moment his country lost the vote in 2010 that he’s not giving up hope.\n<p>Best case for them, a new host country gets picked – but if the tournament date gets moved, then there’s talk of legal action. After all, back in December 2010 the FIFA ExCo members were asked to vote on a tournament to take place in June and July, and that’s the basis on which bids were submitted.\n<p>What about Europe? UEFA president Michel Platini voted for Qatar, but as a former player he has now admitted that it would be awful having to play in temperatures that can reach 50C. The Frenchman is in the camp of moving the tournament by date, not country. Germany’s Karl Heinz Rumenigge is keeping his cards very close to his chest – but the same can’t be said for the English.\n<div><a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/video/data/2.0/video/sports/2012/10/10/intv-davies-qatar-world-cup-prince-ali.cnn.html\">Click to watch video</a></div>\n<p>While the Football Association’s new chief executive Greg Dyke admits a change of date is more likely than a change of venue, the English Premier League is firmly in the camp of wanting a new bidding process. It is one of the few European leagues to have long opposed having a winter break – so a winter World Cup is its worst nightmare. EPL officials point to the huge upheaval it would mean administratively and for the golden goose of television – saying it will have a major impact on three seasons of scheduling.\n<p>CONCACAF president Jeffrey Webb, who represents the North/Central American and Caribbean associations, insists player welfare needs to come first – and says it’s about showing them the necessary respect.\n<p>And a recent study by an English university says “players' bodies could adapt to the extreme conditions if the squad arrives in Qatar early enough.” The unversity's head of sports science John Brewer, who worked with England's team at the 1990 World Cup in Italy, suggested that would mean a month before the tournament.\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.edition.cnn.com/2010/SPORT/football/12/17/world.cup.qatar.blatter.gays/index.html\">Read: Blatter 'sorry' for Qatar World Cup gay remarks</a>\n<p>The Qatari organizers are playing it considerably cooler than their summer temperatures. They know they won the vote to hold the tournament in July – but are very sensibly letting the rest of the football world get their knickers in a twist, saying they’ll be able to put on the tournament whenever they’re asked to. You want it in winter? We’ll make it happen. You want it in summer? We’ll spend the money to air-condition the stadia and training grounds.\n<p>No-one seems to have found a solution for air-conditioning a whole country, though, even if it is the wealthiest on the planet.\n<p>By the way, the FIFA ExCo members knew there were problems with the heat in Qatar when they voted – it was written in the technical reports. And that committee is in charge of world football’s calendar. The calendar is set until 2018, with the next round of scheduling addressing 2019-2022.\n<p>Talk of a move into January or February 2022 looks to be out of the question because it would clash with the Winter Olympics – so if the tournament is moved, then November/December that year is the most likely.\n<p>The problem FIFA has – how to compensate Qatar if it takes away the world’s greatest sporting tournament?

Few complain about Tom Cruise earning around $35m a year (according to Forbes) for making films of utter dross but for some reason when it comes to asking a soccer star to perform week-in, week-out at the highest level, to compete in and often win competitions that captivate the world and to sprinkle football games that create huge profits with their genius, this is somehow beyond the pale?\n<p>Football is not the game of old, it’s as blockbuster as Hollywood and far more reliable to boot. The market decides the value of a player, and though poor value for money purchases are common, history would suggest Madrid –- or Manchester United, who have also been linked with the player - know the real deal when they see it. \n<p>Who doesn’t have sympathy with the thousands in Spain and around the world who struggle to find employment, but this should not deny a person earning what their talent deserves. If and when the Bale deal takes place, this sentiment will surely hold true. \n<p><em>Elsewhere …</em>\n<p>Bad luck Bruno Labbadia, who became the first coach sacked in the Bundesliga just three games, and three defeats, into the season. Stuttgart announced on Twitter they had parted company with the 47-year-old after a 2-1 defeat to Augsburg. German football writer Raphael Honigstein felt the board <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2013/aug/26/stuttgart-bruno-labbadia-bundesliga-sack\">had to act but that a sacking in August doesn’t reflect well on anyone</a>.\n<p>Well done Elche, who played their first top-flight game in Spain for a quarter of a century and scored within five touches from kick off. “Not since the fall of the Berlin Wall had Elche been in La Liga. Eight thousand, eight hundred and thirty-three days later, the Martínez Valero stadium hosted a top-flight game at last, with 23,859 fans in attendance. One minute and 18 seconds later it erupted: Elche were in front,” <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2013/aug/26/la-liga-blog-sid-lowe-elche\">Spanish football writer Sid Lowe commented</a>.\n<br> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/cnniworldsport.wordpress.com/9526/\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/cnniworldsport.wordpress.com/9526/\" border=\"0\"></a> <img height=\"1\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=worldsport.blogs.cnn.com&blog=8188608&post=9526&subd=cnniworldsport&ref=&feed=1\" border=\"0\"><img height=\"1\" width=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/rss/edition_worldsportblog/~4/W5Z0gGldtss\">","direction":"ltr"},"published":1377606804000,"title":"Is Real Madrid's Gareth Bale bid distasteful?","updated":1377610404000,"crawled":1377607136445,"alternate":[{"href":"http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_worldsportblog/~3/W5Z0gGldtss/","type":"text/html"}],"canonical":[{"href":"http://worldsport.blogs.cnn.com/2013/08/27/is-real-madrids-gareth-bale-bid-distasteful/","type":"text/html"}],"summary":{"content":"“A lack of respect for the world we live in.” That was the damning assessment Barcelona head coach Gerardo Martino had for the widely-expected transfer of Wales star Gareth Bale to his side’s archrivals Real Madrid.

Will the tire talk stop?</strong> \n<p>If Formula One’s tire manufacturer was a football manager surely they’d have been sacked by Christmas? It really is last chance saloon for Pirelli, having cashed in their chips before the mid-season break. \n<p>F1’s up-and-down relationship with its tire manufacturer is nothing new, but it reached a new low in the first half of this season.\n<p>You wondered whether Pirelli would have been better off sticking to calendars.\n<p>There was the controversial Mercedes tire test and then the Silverstone shambles when a number of drivers suffered problems. Drivers, teams and fans lost confidence - and serious questions were asked. Pirelli’s advertising deal for circuit hoardings means no other manufacturer is likely to want to take over in a hurry, but it’s not going to be an easy return to action after the break as the characteristics of the Spa circuit make this weekends' Belgian Grand Prix one of the toughest tests for the tires. \n<p><strong>Driver changes?</strong>\n<p>It’s going to be a great few months for the gossip mongers. Who has been spotted talking to who in the back of which garage? We could see as many changes in driver line-ups as changes of tires.\n<p>Daniel Ricciardo is widely expected to be announced as Mark Webber’s replacement at Red Bull for next season. Another Australian, Ricciardo is seen as a natural fit after his time at sister team Toro Rosso. \n<p>Kimi Raikkonen was in the frame for that seat, but there’s now speculation he could be returning to Ferrari for a second stint. There’s been a feeling for a while that Felipe Massa has been living on borrowed time, but is the \"Iceman\" - a world champion with the \"Prancing Horse\" in 2007 - the man for an Italian job? \n<p>And what of Fernando Alonso? How much longer can the two-time world champion put up with a car that just doesn’t cut the mustard? On the flip side, how many more frustrated outbursts from the Spaniard will Ferrari put up with? \n<p>There are also questions being asked about Roman Grosjean’s erratic performances for Lotus. Although the Frenchman does bring considerable financial backing, Nico Hulkenberg isn’t happy at Sauber and Kamui Kobayashi has Japanese backing and wants a return to F1. Watch this space. \n<p><strong>3. How low will Button go?</strong>\n<p>Even the most cynical British sports fan would have struggled to predict that Jenson Button would be a whopping 85 points behind his former teammate Lewis Hamilton after 10 races and sitting ninth in the drivers’ standings. \n<p>The MP4-28 isn’t a car that will be going into the McLaren museum. It’s been so bad that team bosses have said they’ve ended development on it and are now in the business of damage limitation.\n<p>Button has failed to finish on the podium so far this season - in fact hasn’t qualified better than seventh - and despite better showings in Germany and Hungary it’s not beyond the realms of possibilities that the The 2009 world champion could finish the season 100 points worse off than Hamilton.\n<p><strong>4. Will the Red Bull rampage come to an end?</strong>\n<p><a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/SPORT/motorsport/f1/#circuit/10\">1 Red Bull 277<br>\n2 Mercedes 208<br>\n3 Ferrari 194<br>\n4 Lotus 183 </a>\n<p>With Hamilton looking to have found his form can Mercedes stop the Red Bull charge given there’s 69 points between the top two teams heading into the second stretch of the season?\n<p>Webber has already announced he’s off to Porsche and the World Endurance Championship next season and if he takes his foot off the gas and doesn’t clock up a few points here and there the Silver Arrows could have flown past Christian Horner and co before they know what’s happened.\n<p>Mercedes have three wins and four poles from the last five races and have both drivers vying for podium places.\n<p>If Nico Rosberg can avoid adding to the three non-finishes races, which marred his first-half term card and Hamilton’s improvement continues, there could be a different constructors’ champion for the first time in four years.\n<p><strong>Who will win the drivers’ championship?</strong>\n<p><a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/SPORT/motorsport/f1/#circuit/10\">1 Sebastian Vettel Ger Red Bull 172<br>\n2 Kimi Raikkonen Fin Lotus 134<br>\n3 Fernando Alonso Spa Ferrari 133<br>\n4 Lewis Hamilton GB Mercedes 124</a> \n<p>But surely Sebastian Vettel already has the drivers’ title in the bag?\n<p>At this point last season the German was 44 points behind Alonso and still went on to claim his third straight crown. This year he’s got a 38-point lead over second-placed Raikkonen with nine races still to run. He’s got more wins, more podiums and more fastest laps than any other driver. \n<p>But Raikkonen, together with Alonso and Hamilton, will be doing their utmost to stop him. There’s 225 points left to win and all three of his nearest challengers have been there and won the title in the past. \n<p>Raikkonen will be looking for a fifth career victory at Spa on Sunday. He’s finished in the top 10 at every race since last year’s Bahrain GP, but will need to up his game in qualifying to keep up his fight. \n<p>Ross Brawn has promised there’s more to come from Hamilton after his first victory in a Mercedes at last month's Hungarian GP.\n<p>The 2008 world champion has scored more points than any other driver in the last three races as well as taking pole in each of them. And his fight with teammate Rosberg could push both of them up the rankings.

F1’s up-and-down relationship with its tire manufacturer is nothing new, but it reached a new low […]<img height=\"1\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=worldsport.blogs.cnn.com&blog=8188608&post=9486&subd=cnniworldsport&ref=&feed=1\" border=\"0\">"},"alternate":[{"href":"http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_worldsportblog/~3/5ghwWxEov10/","type":"text/html"}],"unread":true,"engagement":15},{"originId":"http://worldsport.blogs.cnn.com/?p=9483","fingerprint":"67cbce3c","keywords":["World Sport Analysis","Amanda Davies","CNN World Sport"],"id":"sh0QEshPZ5O6oYQJdLBgzxr2EU4lzrrJXCTV7z00q8A=_140a0acb672:6e672:8cbb3c8f","crawled":1377085208178,"content":{"direction":"ltr","content":"<blockquote><p>I'm in no doubt there's been massive steps in the right direction, but can 100% passed tests really mean 100% clean?

Just this week two English Premier League managers joined the chorus of concern.\n<p>Everton boss Roberto Martinez questioned whether it was healthy to have the window open when league games are being played. “It’s a bigger question for every football fan because I think it devalues the league,” he told the BBC, and with good reason.\n<p>Two of his best players, Marouane Fellaini and Leighton Baines, have been subject to bids from Manchester United in the last few days.\n<p>Newcastle United manager Alan Pardew, who is trying to ward off an attempt from Arsenal to lure his star midfielder Yohan Cabaye away from St James’ Park, added: \"I know the Premier League asked the European leagues to do it and they wouldn't fall in line, but after … the situations we have had this summer … it is definitely something they need to put under the microscope again.\"\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.edition.cnn.com/2013/08/02/sport/football/football-transfer-window/index.html\">Read: The transfer window explained</a>\n<p>There is plenty of opposition to the transfer window - which for most European leagues will end on September 2 before reopening for a month on January 1 - but is there a better alternative? Would it make sense to streamline the windows even further, or, conversely, go back to letting clubs sign players throughout the season?\n<p>The current concept was put in place in 2002 after a lengthy consultation by FIFA, global player representative group FIFPro, the now disbanded \"G14\" collective of Europe's biggest clubs, and the European Commission.\n<p>The previous system was seen as unfair, explains Daniel Geey, a London-based lawyer in the sports group for Field Fisher Waterhouse who advises clubs on the regulatory framework of football transfers.\n<p>“The main issue with being able to buy players throughout the year was that the more wealthy clubs had greater opportunities to sign a player towards the end of the season to bolster a title challenge or to stave off relegation. It could be argued the wealthy clubs benefited the most,\" he told CNN.\n<p>“In theory a limited supply window can drive up prices, but there is no counter factual situation to compare – a player’s value is only really determined by the two clubs involved and this is the case regardless of the window. It is far from perfect but I’m not convinced there’s a readymade alternative.”\n<p>According to Liz Ellen, a specialist sports lawyer for Mishcon de Reya and an FA Licensed Players' Agent since 2004, not even the agents lick their lips at the negotiation leverage a deadline creates:\n<p>“I wouldn’t say agents are big fans of the transfer window - if you could sell players all year round, that would be a much better position to be in than the panic buying and selling during the windows.\n<p>“Most agents will tell you it’s a difficult market these days. Some of the bigger deals go through, but with smaller squads and financial fair play, often clubs won’t take a chance now. There’s much more pressure on finances, to make sure you spend the money wisely. I wouldn’t say agents are relishing the next few days because it’s a high-pressure situation for everyone involved.”\n<div><a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/video/data/2.0/video/sports/2013/07/30/football-kassis-agent-transfer-market-psg-monaco.cnn.html\">Click to watch video</a></div>\n<p>So, if trading throughout the year creates an uneven playing field that benefits the rich, would a shorter transfer window be the solution?\n<p>“I find it difficult to imagine a more streamlined window,\" Geey told CNN. \"After all, with good planning and proactive strategies in place, a club can register a player as soon as the window opens. I think interested parties - to stoke up interest in their players - would always provide stories to the newspapers whether there was a window or not.”\n<p>Ellen admits the window closing during the season is not ideal as clubs can be left “quite vulnerable” to bids, without time to find replacements, but fundamentally there seems no change in sight for the transfer window.\n<p>And is this really such a bad thing? The great allure of football is surely its unpredictability and often its intrinsic injustice, where teams who do not deserve victory can win.\n<p>This perfect chaos has a beauty, why should it not extend to the transfer market? Business dealings should always be legal and beyond reproach, but the game of the world football marketplace is just another area of competition in which managers can test their wits. Time to play to win, Arsene …\n<br> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/cnniworldsport.wordpress.com/9475/\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/cnniworldsport.wordpress.com/9475/\" border=\"0\"></a> <img height=\"1\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=worldsport.blogs.cnn.com&blog=8188608&post=9475&subd=cnniworldsport&ref=&feed=1\" border=\"0\"><img height=\"1\" width=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/rss/edition_worldsportblog/~4/1Ht9OetPgfY\">","direction":"ltr"},"title":"Does football's transfer window need fixing?","published":1377015899000,"updated":1377019499000,"crawled":1377015918953,"alternate":[{"href":"http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_worldsportblog/~3/1Ht9OetPgfY/","type":"text/html"}],"canonical":[{"href":"http://worldsport.blogs.cnn.com/2013/08/20/does-footballs-transfer-window-need-fixing/","type":"text/html"}],"summary":{"content":"Transfer windows have become an integral part of the modern football landscape.

(Getty Images)</div></div>\n<p>The wait is over. Soccer devotees across Europe, strung out during the off season with only the scraps of transfer rumors and player sales to keep them sated, can now quench the pang of their addiction with weekly hits of league football.\n<p>The German Bundesliga returned on August 9 with Bayern beating Borussia Monchengladbach, France's Ligue 1 saw nouveau riche champions PSG held by Montpellier on the same day, while Italy's Serie A gets going on August 24. The two remaining elite divisions of Spain and England kick off this weekend.\n<p>There have been many managerial moves since May but the English Premier League has seen a fascinating shuffling of characters that now hold the reins at a clutch of the world’s biggest clubs.\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2013/06/10/sport/football/jose-mourinho-chelsea-football/index.html\">Jose Mourinho has reignited his love affair with London-based Chelsea</a> after a tumultuous tenure at Real Madrid, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2013/06/14/sport/football/pellegrini-manchester-city/index.html\">the sagacious Manuel Pellegrini replaced Roberto Mancini</a> in a bid to regain Manchester City’s grip on the title and, in one of the most arresting events of the last few months, Arsene Wenger looks like he might splash some money at Arsenal to reinvigorate a challenge for domestic silverware. (Not sure I’d advise holding your breath …)\n<p>But the most important story in town has to be <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2013/05/09/sport/football/david-moyes-ferguson-mourinho-manchester-united-football/index.html\">David Moyes taking over at Manchester United.</a> Not just because the Red Devils are arguably the biggest club in the world in terms of fan base, not just because the side strolled to the title last season, but mainly due to the fact there is no European Champions League side that could boast the continuity of leadership and success that Alex Ferguson embodied.\n<div><a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/video/data/2.0/video/sports/2013/05/09/seg-moye-appointment.cnn.html\">Click to watch video</a></div>\n<p>Fergie wasn’t just a manager: he built the modern club and forged its fearsome reputation. The challenge of managing the transition while also delivering continued success on the pitch has to be one of the toughest gigs in world football in 2013.\n<p>The first hurdle has been cleared. United brushed past second-division side Wigan 2-0 in the FA Community Shield, the traditional season-opener between the FA Cup winners and the league champions, to seal their first trophy of the campaign.\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2013/07/17/sport/football/football-rooney-transfer-saga/index.html\">Read: United reject Chelsea offer for 'angry' Rooney</a>\n<p>Next up: The Wayne Rooney saga. So far Moyes can be pleased with his performance. It would be my guess that Rooney is going nowhere unless one or two marquee names move to Old Trafford as replacements, and this seems wise. Rooney is a world-beater on his day and the task of reinvigorating him is far easier than replacing him, even if the Old Trafford fans have tired of his petulance. A bag-full of goals would surely solve that.\n<p>Conversely, if Cesc Fabregas can be persuaded to leave Barcelona (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2013/07/26/sport/football/football-martino-barcelona/index.html\">the odds are slim, admittedly</a>) and Leighton Baines can be prised from Everton, selling Rooney for $45m would seem good business. Moyes’ mantra should be \"stick\" unless United come off stronger, and he looks to be following that so far. During his time at Everton he was fantastically surefooted in the transfer market and it would be out of character for him to be blindsided now.\n<p>The transfer window will shut in a few weeks’ time, and Moyes’ market mettle will have been proven or dispelled by September. Then there are the fixtures.\n<p>Away to Swansea is a tricky first game. Michael Laudrup’s League Cup winners lost only four games at home last season and, with Michu and new signing Wilfried Bony leading the line, the Swans have strikers who could trouble any side.\n<p>Moyes must then face Rooney's suitors Chelsea at home and trips to Liverpool and Man City before October. United under Ferguson were famously slow starters, picking up form post-January to peak in the run-in. Moyes will not have the same luxury this time around. Draws will be fine; too many defeats could sow seeds of doubt.\n<p>Finally, he needs to manage the media. Famously predatory, the English press are salivating over the potential for headlines from Old Trafford. Bad news normally sells better than good, too. Moyes, then, will need to spin his narrative to provide headlines and copy that keep the press on his and United’s side.\n<p>Despite criticism, my personal opinion is that the Scot has been solid in this regard so far. He lacks the flamboyance of Mourinho but he has projected an unruffled, man-in-control type vibe. One of Ferguson’s greatest assets was maintaining this under the greatest pressure; Moyes will be hoping he stands up to the test in similar fashion.\n<p>The start of the English Premier League will be fascinating.

Those days are long gone.\n<p>However, one man brimming with self-belief is Jason Dufner.\n<p>The 36-year-old should have recorded the first major triumph of his career at this event in 2011, but he blew a five-shot lead over the final three holes at Atlanta Athletic Club to surrender the title to Keegan Bradley.\n<p>He corrected that error on Sunday, showing the steely nerve which abandoned him two years ago <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2013/08/11/sport/golf/pga-championship/index.html\">to secure a two-stroke victory over Jim Furyk.</a>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2013/08/12/sport/golf/lee-westwood-twitter-golf/\">Read: Westwood turns on Twitter trolls </a>\n<p>Dufner shot to prominence earlier this year, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2013/04/01/sport/golf/golf-points-putter/index.html\">when an unfortunate photograph of him looking bored and vacant during an appearance at a school in Texas spawned a spate of imitations, creating the craze of “Dufnering.”</a>\n<p>The Cleveland native displayed an altogether more admirable indifference down the stretch on Sunday, carding a two-under-par final round to win the first major of his 13-year pro career.\n<p>Unlike Dufner, Woods' career will likely be defined by whether he can match Jack Nicklaus’ record haul of 18 major titles.\n<p>And as far as performance in golf’s four marquee tournaments is concerned, Woods is enduring a gargantuan slump.\n<p>By the time next April's Masters comes around, the current world No. 1's major drought will be just shy of six years.

Am I the only one who is outraged by the amount of money Real Madrid are willing to spend on Gareth Bale?\n<p>The latest reports suggest the Spanish giants are ready to splash a world record $120 million on the Welsh winger.\n<p>Surely this is too much cash for a player who has yet to win a single trophy and has only truly enjoyed one world class season with Tottenham?<span></span>\n<p>Now, I have been around long enough to know there is no logic in football, especially when it comes to financial matters.\n<p>However, it’s worth taking a closer look at this summer’s big transfer story from all perspectives, because it promises to run and run.\n<p>What I will say right away is that in my opinion, Real Madrid don’t need Bale. As good as he is, Real already have enough attacking players in their squad.\n<p>Let’s check : right now, Bale’s natural position on the left wing, is already taken by Cristiano Ronaldo.\n<p>If that wasn’t enough, Los Blancos also have Mesut Ozil and Isco who can play on the left or behind the striker as a “number 10”.\n<p>Real can also call on the services of Angel Di Maria and Luka Modric, two other top players who perform similar duties.\n<p>You could be tempted to say that any team on the planet would want a great player like Bale. There is no doubt he is incredibly talented and has great potential.\n<p>As a matter of fact, the 24-year-old winger is coming off the best season of his career, scoring 26 goals for Spurs in all competitions.\n<p>Some of those goals were spectacular and allowed him to pick up two individual accolades – the PFA Young Player and Players’ Player of the Year awards.\n<p>However, it we have a closer look at his career, we find that he has never won a single trophy at club or national team level.<br>\nFurthermore, he has only ever played one season in the UEFA Champions League, the competition Real Madrid want to win above everything else.\n<p>As a matter of fact, if they had to go out and spend a lot of money on one player, I believe it would be better spent on a striker.\n<p>Considering Gonzalo Higuain was sold to Napoli, Real would benefit from having another forward.\n<p>Besides Karim Benzema, manager Carlo Ancelotti has no other proven goalscorer who can play in the box, so why not go out and spend $60 million or $70 million on someone like Luis Suarez?\n<p>So what about Spurs? Most of their fans will be reading this and thinking that they would never want to sell their prized asset.\n<p>However, if you got over $100 million for Bale, isn’t that good business? With that kind of money, you could go out and get at least two world class players.\n<p> Who knows, as part of a deal for Bale, you could even get Modric or Di Maria in exchange, two proven internationals, who would walk right into the side.\n<p>Plus, as great as Bale was last season, it is not guaranteed that he can perform at that level again if he stays at Spurs, especially if he isn’t happy.\n<p>There have been a lot of reports out there that he wants to go to Madrid, so, if he is not allowed to leave, will he still give 100% day in and day out?\n<p>In my opinion this deal will be done, and it will be done soon. Considering Real want Bale and Bale wants Real, it is just a matter of time before Spurs accept to sell the player.\n<p>The fee will be outrageous, and when the dust settles, I will be thinking how and why the transfer world record was broken.\n<br> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/cnniworldsport.wordpress.com/9335/\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/cnniworldsport.wordpress.com/9335/\" border=\"0\"></a> <img height=\"1\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=worldsport.blogs.cnn.com&blog=8188608&post=9335&subd=cnniworldsport&ref=&feed=1\" border=\"0\"><img height=\"1\" width=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/rss/edition_worldsportblog/~4/HhPKZQDH4WQ\">","direction":"ltr"},"published":1375271368000,"crawled":1375271404647,"title":"The Real deal: Is Gareth Bale worth $120m?","alternate":[{"href":"http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_worldsportblog/~3/HhPKZQDH4WQ/","type":"text/html"}],"canonical":[{"href":"http://worldsport.blogs.cnn.com/2013/07/31/the-real-deal-is-gareth-bale-worth-120m/","type":"text/html"}],"summary":{"content":"Just wait a minute.

(Getty Images)</div></div>\n<p>Martino who? That’s what most football fans were thinking when Gerardo “El Tata” Martino was announced as FC Barcelona’s new manager.\n<p>The truth is the 50 year-old Argentine is practically unknown outside of South America, given he has only ever managed in his home continent.\n<p>So how did he get the job? Well, in my opinion, there were three factors which led the reigning Spanish Champions to appoint Martino: the influence of Leo Messi, the coach’s football philosophy, and the lack of other alternatives.<span></span>\n<p>So let’s start with Messi and his influence at Barcelona.\n<p>From various sources close to the club, I have heard repeatedly that the Argentine star calls a lot of shots behind the scenes.\n<p>For example, his desire for the team to play around him was one of the reasons the club sold Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Samuel Eto’o and David Villa.\n<p>All of them were world class strikers who had to tip-toe their way around Messi before being shipped out of the Camp Nou after being considered surplus to requirements.\n<p>As far as the role Leo had in the new manager’s appointment, it is easy to find links between Messi and Martino.\n<p>First of all, they are both from Rosario, in Argentina. Second of all, Leo’s dad, Jorge, idolized Martino in the 90’s when he played for his local club, Newell’s Old Boys.\n<p>And thirdly, one of Martino’s assistants once coached little Leo when he was a 10-year-old back home.\n<p>Perhaps the clearest indication of Leo’s influence at the Camp Nou came from Martino himself, who said on Tuesday, “I know the Messi family spoke with the Barcelona board about me and I appreciate that.”\n<p>So onto Martino’s football philosophy. Those who know him well say he believes that the best defence is a good attack.\n<p>During his early coaching days, his mentor was Marcelo Bielsa and there is little doubt he sings from the same hymn book as \"El Loco,\" meaning he is a fan of attacking, free-flowing football.\n<p>That will be music to the ears of Barcelona fans since this team is built to play that way. I expect Martino to keep the 4-3-3 formation which is familiar to the players and continue to encourage the team to play a high pressing game.\n<p>Considering the team will keep a similar playing style to the one deployed by former Barca coaches Pep Guardiola and Tito Vilanova, I believe Martino’s big challenge this season will be keeping Messi and new signing Neymar happy.\n<p>The Brazilian may have arrived at Barcelona knowing it’s all about Leo, but he will still expect to play an important role in the team, and finding a balance between both superstars may be trickier than the new coach is expecting.\n<p>I am curious to find out how he will manage their egos, especially considering the fact he has never dealt with such high-profile players in his career.\n<p>So was \"El Tata\" the right choice? Barcelona will argue they didn’t have many people to pick from. \n<p>To be fair, the club’s directors had to make a move quickly after Vilanova announced he would have to leave his post to continue his battle against cancer.\n<p>With the season just a couple of weeks away, most if not all of the top managers were taken, so they really didn’t have much choice.\n<p>Former player Luis Enrique was linked to the post, as was Dutch veteran Guus Hiddink, but neither confirmed they had been officially approached.\n<p>In the past, Barcelona had elected to appoint someone from within, but at this moment there was no-one with the capacity or charisma to take over.\n<p>We all saw what happened when Jordi Roura had to fill in for Vilanova last season. There was lack of leadership, lack of direction and lack of inspiration from the sidelines.\n<p>The jury is out on Martino. On his side, he has one of the most skilful teams ever assembled. Against him, he has the pressure of making them win, and win in style. \n<br> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/cnniworldsport.wordpress.com/9326/\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/cnniworldsport.wordpress.com/9326/\" border=\"0\"></a> <img height=\"1\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=worldsport.blogs.cnn.com&blog=8188608&post=9326&subd=cnniworldsport&ref=&feed=1\" border=\"0\"><img height=\"1\" width=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/rss/edition_worldsportblog/~4/l3tmQ-SV67k\">","direction":"ltr"},"published":1374766924000,"crawled":1374766943264,"title":"Martino who?

Simply put, doubles just doesn't get the attention or TV coverage it deserves.<span></span>\n<p>The long-standing argument against showing doubles on TV is that the viewing public neither knows the players nor cares about the sport.\n<p>It's the same argument given for the majority of women's sports, soccer in the United States, the NFL in Europe and a myriad of other emerging sports.\n<p>The obvious counter argument is, how will they ever get to know or care, if they’re not exposed to them?\n<div><a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/video/?/video/sports/2013/07/18/open-court-bryan-brothers-wimbledon.cnn\">Click to watch video</a></div>\n<p>Recreationally, the vast majority of active tennis players the world over are doubles players, and with tennis being one of the largest participatory sport in the world, that's one giant potential media market.\n<p>So why aren't any of the major sporting networks willing to devote a fair portion of their tennis coverage to the four-player format of the game?\n<p>Well, it's a risk. \n<p>In order to reduce this risk, ideally what the networks need is a doubles pairing to build their coverage around who the general public can really get behind. A pair with charisma and talent, entertaining and media-friendly, and above all else, wins.\n<p>But where are we going to find a pair like that?\n<p>For the best part of the last decade the Bryan brothers have been the most dominate doubles team on the planet.\n<p>They've won a staggering 91 titles (six more than Roger Federer), 15 of which were grand slams (one more than Pete Sampras) and have spent well over 300 weeks at the top of the world rankings, (several weeks more than Federer’s record), and are still at the top of their game in their mid-thirties.\n<p>Plus they're in a band, and what's cooler than that?\n<p>The chest-bumping, crowd-pleasing Bryan brothers are, in a nutshell, the greatest doubles partnership of all time. \n<p>And yet, in their home country, they are barely known outside the tennis world. \n<p>This summer, as the Bryan brothers look to build on their already unprecedented legacy and claim the calendar grand slam, TV networks are provided with the best opportunity there may ever be to promote doubles both globally and in the United States.\n<p>This year’s U.S. Open will also mark a full decade since Andy Roddick claimed the last of the U.S.’s men’s singles majors, and the chances of this run being broken at this year’s tournament are slim to none. So just as the Brits built their Wimbledon coverage around Andy Murray, and the world took notice, now the U.S. should do with the same with the Bryan twins. \n<p>Surely they can find time during the wall-to-wall coverage for six, best-of-three-set matches spread over two weeks?\n<p>If you broadcast it, they will watch.\n<br> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/cnniworldsport.wordpress.com/9320/\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/cnniworldsport.wordpress.com/9320/\" border=\"0\"></a> <img height=\"1\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=worldsport.blogs.cnn.com&blog=8188608&post=9320&subd=cnniworldsport&ref=&feed=1\" border=\"0\"><img height=\"1\" width=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/rss/edition_worldsportblog/~4/mr03zIw8zuE\">","direction":"ltr"},"title":"Double vision: Bryan brothers deserve wider TV audience","published":1374589477000,"crawled":1374589486671,"alternate":[{"href":"http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_worldsportblog/~3/mr03zIw8zuE/","type":"text/html"}],"canonical":[{"href":"http://worldsport.blogs.cnn.com/2013/07/23/double-vision-bryan-brothers-deserve-wider-tv-audience/","type":"text/html"}],"summary":{"content":"Heading into the 2013 U.S. Open, 35-year-old American twins Bob and Mike Bryan stand on the verge of a feat rarer than any other in tennis, as they attempt to complete the first ever men’s doubles calendar grand slam in the Open era.

From Harry Vardon and James Braid to Walter Hagen and Henry Cotton. Not forgetting Gary Player, Jack Nicklaus and Tom Watson as well as Nick Faldo (twice) and Ernie Els. So history suggests a class player. \n<p>However history here also suggests that Muirfield can sometimes be the first to identify that class.\n<p>Vardon won the first of his six Opens here, Player's first major of nine came on these links, Nicklaus's debut Open Championship too. More recently, Faldo's 1987 Muirfield Open was the first of his six career majors.<span></span> \n<p>So, perhaps an emerging top-class talent. That narrows it down a little, but, this being the Open Championship, not a great deal.\n<p>So maybe we should be looking at the current course conditions for more guidance.\n<p>Every morning we're waking to blue skies, rising temperatures and a gentle breeze.\n<p>Carnoustie in October this is not. The fairways are golden and browning further. With four-foot high, whispy rough lining every tight fairway, the course resembles a part-harvested field of wheat on a glorious August afternoon. \n<p>In practice rounds, players are hitting one, maybe two drivers a day. Otherwise they're tackling long par-four holes with a controlled iron off the tee, and still coming in with short irons and wedges.\n<p>Quite simply, someone who misses more than the odd fairway here - and some are ribbon-like in their meager width - is not going to win at Muirfield. Their second is very unlikely to reach the green, and even if it were to, it's certainly not going to stop on it.\n<p>The only way to score is to come in from the fairway, with enough spin and elevation to control the ball when it lands.\n<p>When we spoke to Rory McIlroy earlier this week he told us he thought his naturally high ball flight would be a big advantage.\n<p>He's got a strong point there, I'm just not entirely convinced that after working on his swing so much this year he's going to be playing off the short stuff on every hole. If he were to crack that first part, though, he'd not be far away from the Claret Jug.\n<p>Rory's playing partner in the first two rounds, Phil Mickelson, arrives here fresh from his first victory on a links course, at last week's Scottish Open.\n<p>He says he's finally worked out putting on this type of green. He's certainly another of the favorites, and it would be his first Open, although Castle Stuart has fairways of much greater generosity. Perhaps. \n<p>Els, Louis Oosthuizen and now Adam Scott have all proved they can win at the highest level, withstanding the intense pressures of a major championship. They've all performed outstandingly on links course here in Britain: they also have the iron play to prosper here. All contenders.\n<p>But if you're looking for outstanding iron players with great short games, a couple of names stand out.\n<p>Neither has won a major. Both undoubtedly have the class to do so. Yes, Justin Rose has the talent, and has more than a decent shout, but surely two in a row would be just too much to ask?\n<p>So while betting on golf is not a path to riches, I'm tempted by the chances of Matteo Manassero and Luke Donald. Logic and history together. It'll never catch on.\n<p>Oh and I haven't even mentioned Tiger Woods, because, frankly, who knows. If he plays as he did at Hoylake in 2006, he'll win. We'll start to have an answer to that one by Thursday evening. \n<p>Play starts at 0632 on Thursday. Four long days later we'll have a champion. This being Muirfield, whoevever it is, the odds are it won't be their last moment at the summit of the game.\n<br> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/cnniworldsport.wordpress.com/9314/\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/cnniworldsport.wordpress.com/9314/\" border=\"0\"></a> <img height=\"1\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=worldsport.blogs.cnn.com&blog=8188608&post=9314&subd=cnniworldsport&ref=&feed=1\" border=\"0\"><img height=\"1\" width=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/rss/edition_worldsportblog/~4/nOV-QBMEWgE\">","direction":"ltr"},"title":"British Open 2013: And the winner is......","alternate":[{"href":"http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_worldsportblog/~3/nOV-QBMEWgE/","type":"text/html"}],"canonical":[{"href":"http://worldsport.blogs.cnn.com/2013/07/17/british-open-2013-and-the-winner-is/","type":"text/html"}],"summary":{"content":"If anyone tells you they know who's going to win this year's British Open Championship, and proffers betting advice, walk away.

Former Olympic heptathlon champion Denise Lewis and anti-doping guru Michele Verroken are just two of the growing number of voices who have called for the tougher sanction after the revelations of the last few days. \n<p>But would lifetime bans really mean we can go on living our lives in a world free of cheats? Please excuse me while I laugh into my bottle of sports recovery supplement. \n<p>With the news of positive samples for Tyson Gay, Asafa Powell and Sherone Simpson has come a sharp wake up call, although all three deny intentionally doping.\n<p>These are not no-names struggling to rub together a crust. These are athletes at the top of their game - with their names at the top of the leaderboards. \n<p>Four of last year’s Olympic men’s 100m finalists are now tainted by doping scandals. As well as Gay and Powell, bronze medallist Justin Gatlin has twice been banned for doping, while runner-up Yohan Blake served a three-month ban in 2009.\n<p>We thought - maybe just hoped - that we were winning the fight. The London Olympics was heralded as a major step in the right direction – with new relationships between drugs companies and anti-doping authorities, and more tests for the right things. \n<p>But sadly the odds are still – and will always be – stacked in favour of the cheats. Yes, there has been massive progress with the biological passport and the Adams whereabouts testing scheme. \n<p>But the cheats will always be one step ahead. It's the age old problem – the testers can only test for what they know about.\n<p>Many of the current bans are just about long enough to go and get your hair done.\n<p>Offenders can be back in the game in time to try the latest drugs before the testers have even worked out how to spell them. \n<p>At least lifetime bans would mean one strike and you’re out. And those doing things the right way will be given, if not a level playing field, one that’s a little less bumpy. \n<p>You can’t escape the fact that there will always be those who bend the rules to succeed. It’s the same in all aspects of society. And in sport – the rewards will continue to outweigh the risks.<br>\nBig money sponsorship deals with the likes of Nike, Omega, Lucozade, and Adidas have followed Gay and Powell’s success on the track. Adidas have certainly been quick off the blocks to drop Gay in the wake of this failed test.\n<p>For all the testing and talk of change – there will always be those who cheat. But it’s the widespread acceptance that is most worrying. \n<p>Five Jamaican athletes on the same team at the same meeting, all linked to positive test results, is not a one-off case. The parallels with where cycling was 15 years ago are frightening, “everyone else is doing it, so I’m just keeping pace”.\n<p>One or two athletes and former athletes speaking out every time there’s a positive test isn’t going to change the sport. \n<p>It needs self-regulation from everyone – and needs the athletes, coaches, trainers, and managers to buy into a new attitude – a new system and mindset to move things on. Without that, no ban will be tough enough to beat the cheats. \n<br> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/cnniworldsport.wordpress.com/9309/\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/cnniworldsport.wordpress.com/9309/\" border=\"0\"></a> <img height=\"1\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=worldsport.blogs.cnn.com&blog=8188608&post=9309&subd=cnniworldsport&ref=&feed=1\" border=\"0\"><img height=\"1\" width=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/rss/edition_worldsportblog/~4/aFc71F3xFN8\">","direction":"ltr"},"title":"Are lifelong bans the only way to deter dopers?","alternate":[{"href":"http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_worldsportblog/~3/aFc71F3xFN8/","type":"text/html"}],"canonical":[{"href":"http://worldsport.blogs.cnn.com/2013/07/16/are-lifelong-bans-the-only-way-to-deter-dopers/","type":"text/html"}],"summary":{"content":"I hate to break it to you, but sport will never be completely clean.

Is Kaka staying? What can this side actually win this season?\n<p>Let’s begin with Ronaldo’s future. In my view it would be a terrible mistake for him to leave Madrid anytime soon.\n<p>He is the heart and soul of Real and has an opportunity to become part of the club’s history.\n<p>The Portuguese star is already in sixth place on the list of Real’s all-time top scorers having hit the back of the net 201 times in 199 games.\n<p>If he continues to score goals at this rate, he could challenge Raul’s record of 323 goals for the club in a few years.\n<p>Another reason for Ronaldo to stay is that since Mourinho has gone, a lot of negative energy will have disappeared from the Bernabeu.\n<p>I believe this new era could be a positive one for CR7 as he will not pay for having the same nationality as his controversial manager. He will be able to shine without getting involved in the crossfire between the media and Mourinho.\n<p>As far as Kaka is concerned, it’s time for him to go. Hampered by injuries and inconsistent form, he has never been able to settle in Madrid since making a $91 million move from AC Milan four years ago.\n<p>Even though he has a great relationship with Ancelotti from the time they spent together in Italy, I don’t know how he is going to get any playing time since he will be competing for a place with Mesut Ozil, Luka Modric and new signing Isco.\n<p>I really don’t see the point of hanging around. If I were Kaka, I would want to play. He should take a pay cut and guarantee some minutes somewhere else, giving himself a chance of fighting his way back into the Brazilian squad with the World Cup on home soil next year.\n<p>So what expectations should we have for Real next season? Ancelotti is a winner and will surely make sure the team challenges for titles, but I honestly don’t see Los Merengues winning anything next year.\n<p>Domestically, Barcelona are still too good, especially with the addition of Neymar and there is no way Real will find a new identity in a few months and be able to compete with their Catalan rivals.\n<p>In Europe I don’t see them having much success either. There are too many good teams out there right now and Real still don’t have a superstar striker they can count on to score big goals in big games.\n<p>Ronaldo cannot continue to carry this team on his shoulders at home and abroad without help from another consistent scorer.\n<p>Under Mourinho, they made the semi-finals of the Champions League three years in a row. Honestly, I can’t see them doing any better in the upcoming campaign.\n<p>So, there is no doubt we can expect a more harmonious year at the Bernabeu without tension around Iker Casillas or any other major star, but don’t expect any silverware. Ancelotti will need time to create a winning team in Madrid.\n<br> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/cnniworldsport.wordpress.com/9304/\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/cnniworldsport.wordpress.com/9304/\" border=\"0\"></a> <img height=\"1\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=worldsport.blogs.cnn.com&blog=8188608&post=9304&subd=cnniworldsport&ref=&feed=1\" border=\"0\"><img height=\"1\" width=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/rss/edition_worldsportblog/~4/Ye9FOZfiNfY\">","direction":"ltr"},"published":1373624566000,"crawled":1373624594256,"alternate":[{"href":"http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_worldsportblog/~3/Ye9FOZfiNfY/","type":"text/html"}],"canonical":[{"href":"http://worldsport.blogs.cnn.com/2013/07/12/can-real-madrid-reign-in-spain/","type":"text/html"}],"author":"tommcgowan","origin":{"htmlUrl":"http://worldsport.blogs.cnn.com","streamId":"feed/http://rss.cnn.com/rss/edition_worldsportblog.rss","title":"CNN World Sport"},"summary":{"content":"The dust may still be settling at the Santiago Bernabeu following Jose Mourinho’s turbulent reign at Real Madrid, but a new era is already dawning at the most successful club in European football.

(Getty Images).</div></div>\n<p>Since Fred Perry defeated the German Gottfried von Cramm in a one-sided 6-1 6-1 6-0 final to claim his third successive men’s Wimbledon singles title 77 years ago, Britain has pinned its hopes on a procession of native challengers, each of whom have come and gone without success.\n<p>Andy Murray finally ended that interminable wait by beating Novak Djokovic on Sunday, but the wait has been so long there has been talk of curses and jinxes.\n<p>But was there ever really a curse? \n<p>In truth, in the seven decades since Fred Perry’s three-peat as Wimbledon champion, Britain has never produced a legitimate Wimbledon contender - with the exception of 1939 runner-up Bunny Austin.<span></span>\n<p>Roger Taylor made a few semifinal appearances back in the 1960s and 70s, but in the era of Rod Laver and John Newcombe, his chances of going any further were slim to none. \n<p>His one real opportunity was in 1973, when the vast majority of top players boycotted the event, allowing unknown Jan Kodes to break through and take the title after narrowly beating Taylor in the semis.\n<p>Throughout the 70s, 80s and early 90s, top British prospects Mark Cox, John Lloyd, Buster Mottram and Jeremy Bates between them never made it passed the fourth round. \n<p>But these players weren’t cursed, they simply weren’t good enough. \n<p>Hope of a British champion was rekindled when Greg Rusedski elected to represent Britain over his native Canada in 1995, but his lone run to the quarterfinals in 1997 was an outlier in a Wimbledon career that was better defined by disappointing early round exits. \n<p>Then came Tim Henman. \n<p>Clean-cut, polite and unassuming, Henman exemplified the British aesthetic to a tee. However, his game, while without any obvious weaknesses, lacked a grand slam caliber weapon.\n<p>Compared to Pete Sampras’ serve, Andre Agassi’s forehand, and Patrick Rafter’s volleys, Tim Henman’s smooth and steady game did not resemble that of a Wimbledon champion. \n<p>And yet, from 1996 to 2004 Henman made four semifinal and four quarterfinal appearances, often falling to one of the giants of the game. \n<p>His best opportunity came in 2001, when he seemed set to make his first final only to lose out to a revived and inspired Goran Ivanisevic who seemed to have destiny - and Mother Nature, in the form of very timely rain delays - on his side.\n<p>Henman’s consistent runs into the second week re-energized the British public’s interest in Wimbledon.\n<p>Fans packed the All England Club’s grounds to find a patch of grass on Aorangi Terrace to watch his matches on the big screen. The lawn would go on to be known colloquially as \"Henman Hill.\" \n<p>The British media treated Henman like a choker but it is arguable he was an over-achiever, out-matched by legends of the game. If anything, Henman was blessed, rather than cursed. \n<p>Equally, Britain has been far from cursed in the other Wimbledon events.\n<p>Virginia Wade captured the ladies’ singles title in 1977, just 26 years ago. Last year Jonathan Marray claimed the men’s doubles titles, and even Andy Murray’s own brother Jamie has a Wimbledon title, having won the mixed doubles back in 2007.\n<p>Simply put: there never was a curse. \n<p>In fact, if there was any supernatural intervention, it was destiny. \n<p>In his seventh grand slam final; on the seventh day of the seventh month; facing an opponent seven days younger than him; Andy Murray attempted to claim a title first contested in 1877, becoming the first Brit to do so in 77 years, and the first to win either single championship since Virginia Wade back in 1977.\n<p>Of course, Novak Djokovic was also looking to claim his seventh grand slam title. \n<p>Just one year before, Murray had lost his first Wimbledon final to all-time great Roger Federer. In an emotional post-match speech, the Scot sobbed into the microphone, telling the crowd “I’m getting closer.”\n<p>He was right. \n<p>Just a few weeks later, he was afforded an opportunity few athletes are ever given; a second chance at Wimbledon - this time to claim Olympic gold. \n<p>Facing the same foe, on the same court, Murray overcame his demons and captured a title that seemed for all intents and purposes to be everything he had missed out on in that ill-fated Wimbledon final. \n<p>But it wasn’t a slam. That milestone would have to wait until later that summer, when the Scot defeated Djokovic in five sets to become the U.S. Open champion. \n<p>When he returned to the All England Club in 2013, he was now an Olympic gold medalist, a grand slam champion and a national treasure.\n<p>Under the pupilage of the stoic Ivan Lendl, Murray also had a newfound focus on court, less prone to the outbursts that had once plagued his career and notably steadier under the brightest of spotlights. \n<p>The final game on Sunday was a microcosm of the match as a whole. \n<p>Serving at 40-love, with three championship points on his racket, Murray looked a lock to become Wimbledon champion. \n<p>But Djokovic rallied, tied it up and moved ahead, proving once again that getting to match point and beating the Serb are two totally different tasks. \n<p>The final few points saw dead netcords, incredible angled passing shots and unimaginable return-winners as Djokovic threw everything at Murray for 11 minutes and 47 seconds.\n<p>It was pure unadulterated torture for the 15,000 inside Centre Court, the countless thousands on Henman Hill and the millions all over Britain. \n<p>But, as Djokovic said after finally succumbing, “It wasn’t enough.”\n<p>“Imagine playing i,t” Murray quipped when asked about the agony of watching of the final game.\n<p>Even the poker-faced Lendl couldn’t resist a rare micro-smile, as his lips quivered, suggesting that emotion was being shielded behind his ever-present sunglasses. \n<p>Murray said after the match that he doesn’t remember what happened in the last game. You can be assured that if he comes within eyeshot of a television during Wimbledon for the rest of his life, he’ll soon have every shot memorized. \n<p>The real question is, now that everyone in Britain knows that he can win Wimbledon, will he be expected to do it every year, and what happens if he can’t?\n<p>After all, Fred Perry won three in a row. \n<br> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/cnniworldsport.wordpress.com/9291/\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/cnniworldsport.wordpress.com/9291/\" border=\"0\"></a> <img height=\"1\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=worldsport.blogs.cnn.com&blog=8188608&post=9291&subd=cnniworldsport&ref=&feed=1\" border=\"0\"><img height=\"1\" width=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/rss/edition_worldsportblog/~4/7JuONYvGLqA\">","direction":"ltr"},"title":"Murray fulfils Wimbledon destiny to end British wait","published":1373282304000,"alternate":[{"href":"http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_worldsportblog/~3/7JuONYvGLqA/","type":"text/html"}],"canonical":[{"href":"http://worldsport.blogs.cnn.com/2013/07/08/murray-fulfils-wimbledon-destiny-to-end-british-wait/","type":"text/html"}],"summary":{"content":"Since Fred Perry defeated the German Gottfried von Cramm in a one-sided 6-1 6-1 6-0 final to claim his third successive men’s Wimbledon singles title 77 years ago, Britain has pinned its hopes on a procession of native challengers, each of whom have come and gone without success.

A wise move given the huge pressure the Italian will be under managing the Spanish club.\n<p>Over in Bavaria, when Pep Guardiola recently started work at Bayern Munich he brought with him not one, not two, not three, but four members of his support staff from old club Barcelona - Manuel Estiarte, assistant coach Domenec Torrent, scout and video analyst Carles Planchart and fitness coach Lorenzo Buenaventura.<span></span>\n<p>Estiarte comes from a non-footballing background – <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2013/06/24/sport/football/guardiola-bayern-munich-heynckes\">a former water polo player he won Olympic gold at the Atlanta 1996 Games.</a>\n<p>“He has participated in many Olympic Games,\" said Guardiola. \"I like to take his influences from other sports, he will help us.\"\n<p>And of his support team, Guardiola added: \"It's great that these people were willing to follow me. This is a challenge also for the families, I hope that we manage it well.\"\n<p>Though one European agent recently told me that he would be watching Guardiola’s Bayern tenure closely given he no longer had Tito Vilanova - the current Barca coach –- working with him. Read into that what you will.\n<p>In England, <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2013/05/09/sport/football/david-moyes-ferguson-mourinho-manchester-united-football/\">Manchester United manager David Moyes</a> has brought with him scout Robbie Cooke, assistant Steve Round, goalkeeping coach Chris Woods and coach Jimmy Lumsden from former club Everton as they prepare to follow in Alex Ferguson’s not inconsiderable footsteps.\n<p>Even \"The Special One\" Jose Mourinho can't do with a No. 2 - Rui Faria has been with him - at Porto, Inter Milan, Real and Chelsea - ever since he was coach of Portuguese club U.D. Leiria.\n<p>Clement’s close relationship with Ancelotti has ensured that the Englishman has worked with the Italian at Chelsea, PSG and now Madrid - an impressive trio of the clubs for the former physical education teacher, who has steadily worked his way up the football ladder.\n<p>Assistants are the eyes and ears of the manager on the training pitch or in the dressing room, either playing the role of “good” or “bad” cop depending on the requirements of the team - and more importantly their boss.\n<p>Many Liverpool fans argue that Rafael Benitez was never quite the same as Liverpool manager after he fell out with his right-hand man Pako Ayestaran.\n<p>“It’s unbelievable but that’s the way it is,” Ayestaran told the Daily Mail in April of their fallout.\n<p>“I think it’s sad because we’d been together for so many years. To lose that is a pity. To keep a relationship for 12 years is probably more than many married couples. There were moments when we knew what the other was thinking without even talking. It was a close relationship and I’m proud to be part of the success.”\n<p>Benitez and Ayestaran first met at Osasuna and then worked together at Extremadura, Tenerife and Valencia before they moved to Liverpool. But in August 2007 that relationship came to an acrimonious end.\n<p>Was it coincedence that once Ayestaran had left Anfield, Benitez failed to win another trophy with Liverpool?\n<p>“It wouldn’t be fair to just highlight his knowledge without how much he got from everybody who helped him and myself to be successful,” added Ayestaran, explaining the dynamics of their relationship.\n<p>‘There was Jose Ochotorena the goalkeeper coach and Paco Herrera who was coaching the second team and doing the scouting. We had the right synergy between us and once we left all those synergies disappeared,” insisted Ayestaran.\n<p>Of course, Benitez might beg to differ, given the Spaniard, who is now Napoli coach, went on to win trophies with Inter Milan and Chelsea without Ayestaran.\n<p>Arguably the most famous managerial partnership was Brian Clough and Peter Taylor, wonderfully realized in the film “The Damned United,” based on the novel by David Peace.\n<p>It was a relationship that was frequently acrimonious and irreparably fractured in 1983. The rancor was such that Clough attacked Taylor in a newspaper article labeling him a \"rattlesnake\", \"a snake-in-the-grass\" adding, \"We pass each other on the A52 going to work on most days of the week. But if his car broke down and I saw him thumbing a lift, I wouldn't pick him up, I'd run him over\".\n<p>The importance of loyalty and trust can’t be underestimated. But the complicated relationship between managers and their assistants also begs the question –- do you always want a yes man? If they are saying yes, that is.....\n<br> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/cnniworldsport.wordpress.com/9286/\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/cnniworldsport.wordpress.com/9286/\" border=\"0\"></a> <img height=\"1\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=worldsport.blogs.cnn.com&blog=8188608&post=9286&subd=cnniworldsport&ref=&feed=1\" border=\"0\"><img height=\"1\" width=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/rss/edition_worldsportblog/~4/_eixKgpiZQY\">","direction":"ltr"},"title":"Et tu Brutus?

(Getty Images).</div></div>\n<p>When Floyd Mayweather Jr. stepped into the ring against Robert Guerrero this year, he didn’t just win his 44th professional fight, he added another $34 million to his personal fortune.\n<p>Forbes.com calculated that he earned almost $175,000s per punch or - the way I saw it - he could have paid off my 30-year mortgage in the time it took to scratch his nose. \n<p>Never has a nickname been more appropriate. They call him “Money”.\n<p>Later this year, Mayweather will become even richer when he takes on Mexico’s unbeaten light middleweight champion Saul “Canelo” Alvarez in Las Vegas. \n<p>It is hard to avoid the topic of money when interviewing Mayweather. The words “Money, Power, Respect” were plastered across both his cap and his t-shirt and it didn’t take long for the subject to crop up, though he brought it up first.<span></span>\n<p>The interview was underway when a communication mix-up led my producer Sam Krumov to open the door for one of Mayweather’s many bodyguards. \n<p>Mayweather turned around - shot Sam an icy glare that lasted a good five seconds - and in no uncertain terms instructed him to never, ever do that again.\n<p>“You’re cutting into my business now, you’re cutting into my money.”\n<p>He could have said “You’re cutting into my time”, but they also say that “Time is money” and so perhaps in Mayweather’s world, the two words are interchangeable.\n<p>Fortunately the door was closed without further incident. Mayweather returned his attention to the interview and our producer breathed an almighty sigh of relief. \n<p>Prior to our meeting, Mayweather and Canelo had been squaring off in Atlanta’s Centennial Olympic Park, part of a nationwide tour through 11 cities to promote their fight.\n<p>It is all part of the game now that Mayweather is his own promoter. \n<p>“This is boxing,” he said. “Blood, sweat and tears. This is about being in the Hall of Fame, this is about making a lot of money, this is about giving the fans what they want to see.”\n<p>Mayweather’s wealth is scuh that he could only have imagined once upon a time given his well documented deprived and troubled childhood. \n<p>He grew up in Michigan, pretty much raising himself.\n<p>His Mum was a drug addict and his Dad was in jail during key stages of his development. Mayweather told me that he thinks of these times whenever he’s lacking motivation.\n<p>\"When I'm in the gym I think back. ‘I said, I wanted a certain lifestyle, I wanted to be wealthy one day, I wanted to be the best.’ Tough times don’t last, tough people do.\" \n<p>Mayweather was in a reflective mood and our conversation took some unexpected turns.\n<p>Since he’s never lost a professional fight, I asked him about the last time he’d lost at something else. \n<p>I was half expecting something like ping-pong or a family game of monopoly, not “I lost my Uncle and my Grandfather in the same year - that was rough.” \n<p>My next question, a playful but provocative - “When was the last time you cried” - suddenly seemed redundant.\n<p>He may only be five foot eight inches in height, but Mayweather is undoubtedly one of the biggest personalities in world sport - his personal entourage of at least 20 people helped to confirm that. \n<p>We spent 15 minutes together, which - by my reckoning - means he could have earned around $14 million if he’d spent that time punching someone in the ring.\n<p>Fortunately we were just talking, but hopefully he won’t send us the bill!\n<br> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/cnniworldsport.wordpress.com/9277/\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/cnniworldsport.wordpress.com/9277/\" border=\"0\"></a> <img height=\"1\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=worldsport.blogs.cnn.com&blog=8188608&post=9277&subd=cnniworldsport&ref=&feed=1\" border=\"0\"><img height=\"1\" width=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/rss/edition_worldsportblog/~4/D_UOibdgk6Y\">","direction":"ltr"},"title":"'Tough times don’t last, tough people do' - Floyd Mayweather Jr","published":1372775748000,"alternate":[{"href":"http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_worldsportblog/~3/D_UOibdgk6Y/","type":"text/html"}],"crawled":1372775782092,"canonical":[{"href":"http://worldsport.blogs.cnn.com/2013/07/02/tough-times-dont-last-tough-people-do-floyd-mayweather-jr/","type":"text/html"}],"summary":{"content":"When Floyd Mayweather Jr. stepped into the ring against Robert Guerrero this year, he didn’t just win his 44th professional fight, he added another $34 million to his personal fortune.

Time seemed to stop as Pele assessed his options - before sensing Alberto’s run to his right - he nonchalantly flicked the ball into the path of his captain. The rest is history.<span></span>\n<p>If Pele was the reference point for that 1970 team, these days it is the 21-year-old Neymar, who after the Confederations Cup will head off to Barcelona having <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2013/06/03/sport/football/football-neymar-completes-fc-barcelona-move\">signed for the Catalan club in a $75 million transfer earlier this month.</a>\n<p>Neymar has scored three superb goals during the Confederations Cup, but Luiz Felipe Scolari’s side arguably will be the underdogs when Brazil meet Spain in Sunday’s final.\n<p>These days, with 24/7 coverage of football, perhaps we have become so accustomed to seeing so many Brazilians playing in Europe that the mystique of watching the Brazil national team is no longer quite what it once was.\n<p>Cast your mind back to 1970 and the f word used to describe Brazil's golden generation of player was: flair. More than 30 years later and it's functionality.\n<p>Or as a work colleague put it: \"Look at those old players and they've got rad taches and long hair. It was Seventies flair on and off the field. Now it's streamlined. A calculated machine - just like global football.\"\n<p>“The globalization of football has ensured that the pragmatic goal is always to win,” Isaias Tinoco, who has spent much of his working life developing young players at Brazilian clubs and Vasco da Gama and Flamengo, told CNN.\n<p>“If you can have creativity and emotion that is OK, but the main goal is the three points and titles. Football is a big deal in Brazil and Scolari's team will try to have two characteristics - results and joy,” added Tinoco, as he emphasised the word results.\n<p>In Brazil, Tinoco is viewed as a pioneer in the organization of youth football, first with Vasco and then Flamengo.\n<p>He helped design the training facilities that provided an all-encompassing approach to the development of young players, where they would be housed, fed, educated and given medical care, all in the same place or within walking distance of school.\n<p>Vasco’s most successful period was under Tinoco’s term as technical director and Eurico Miranda as president.\n<p>Winners of Euro 2008 and 2012 as well as the World Cup 2010, Spain’s recent international success owes much to the way Spanish clubs - notably Barcelona - have developed their young players in a similarly “vertically integrated” way, though the emphasis is on ball possession, passing and movement.\n<p>“Spain created a method of game selection that runs from its youth teams to the senior squad,” said Tinoco.\n<p>“In the Under-20 World Cup, which is being played in Turkey at the moment, you can see that the Spanish team plays in a similar style way to the way Vicente Del Bosque’s side does in the Confederations Cup in Brazil.\n<p>“In Brazil we had this vertical integration in clubs –- for Flamengo in the 1980s and the Sao Paulo era under Tele Santana. \n<p>“Right now we have this process being implemented at Atletico Paranaense in Curitiba, while Gremio and Internacional also do this planning in Rio Grande do Sul.\n<p>“The Spanish method is well implemented by their international youth teams; the question is whether the clubs are following suit or is it only Barcelona?”\n<p>Brazil’s geographical size and the diversity of cultures has ensured that the approach to youth development has been more ad-hoc with no systematic football federation led philosophy as there has been in Spain and Germany.\n<p>Tinoco also makes the point that Brazil clubs spend more money paying tax debts than they do investing in youth development.\n<p>And economics mean that Brazilian clubs’ approach to nurturing young players is now influenced by the need to keep one eye on the demands of European clubs who want players that are tactically disciplined and don’t make mistakes. \n<p>Equally, Brazilian coaches have been influenced by their European counterparts who arguably have a more conservative approach to the game. Scolari, of course, was Portugal’s coach between 2003 and 2008.\n<p>If Brazil's “craque” - a type of a gifted, creative and skillful player – factory is no longer in existence, the South American nation remains the number one provider of expatriates within Europe, with 515 Brazilians spread across the 31 divisions, <a href=\"http://www.sportingintelligence.com/2013/01/21/new-research-foreign-players-at-record-levels-across-european-football-210102/\">according to research earlier this year from the CIES Football Observatory in Switzerland.</a>\n<p>Whereas in the past Brazilian players would move to Europe much later in their careers that is no longer the case.\n<p>“Athletes are being taken to other countries without completing the established cycle of development of at least seven years,” said Tinoco. “The exodus is very intense.”\n<p>It is an exodus that is understandable given the Transfers paid to Brazilian clubs as well as the third-party owners of players, but at what price for the future of the Brazilian national team?\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/JohnSinnott\">Follow John Sinnott on Twitter</a>\n<br> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/cnniworldsport.wordpress.com/9267/\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/cnniworldsport.wordpress.com/9267/\" border=\"0\"></a> <img height=\"1\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=worldsport.blogs.cnn.com&blog=8188608&post=9267&subd=cnniworldsport&ref=&feed=1\" border=\"0\"><img height=\"1\" width=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/rss/edition_worldsportblog/~4/cVnnL2PJGuc\">","direction":"ltr"},"title":"Do Brazil still play the beautiful game?","published":1372426829000,"alternate":[{"href":"http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_worldsportblog/~3/cVnnL2PJGuc/","type":"text/html"}],"canonical":[{"href":"http://worldsport.blogs.cnn.com/2013/06/28/do-brazil-still-play-the-beautiful-game/","type":"text/html"}],"author":"jsinnottcnn","crawled":1372426868442,"origin":{"streamId":"feed/http://rss.cnn.com/rss/edition_worldsportblog.rss","htmlUrl":"http://worldsport.blogs.cnn.com","title":"CNN World Sport"},"summary":{"content":"While Brazil’s World Cup winning team in 1970 entranced the world it ensured that that golden generation became the benchmark by which every subsequent Brazilian coach and player would be measured.

There is a stony silence before he smirks and, six seconds later, finally shrugs and replies, \"I don’t know. I think it’s had more of an effect on you journalists trying to make a story out of it than on the actual riders.”\n<p>It doesn’t reflect that well on him –- or me for that matter. But my chat with Mark Cavendish at last month's Giro D’Italia summed up pretty early on in our filming for CNN's Changing Gear series the current view within cycling of the events of the last 12 months.\n<p>Cav had a red jersey to win. He’s moved on - and despite what the media might think –- most of the sport really has too.\n<div><a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/video/data/2.0/video/sports/2013/06/24/davies-cycling-cavendish.cnn\">Click to watch video</a></div>\n<p>The likes of Bradley Wiggins, David Millar and Taylor Phinney were more patient with my questions.\n<p>But the reminders were always there. \"Lance Armstrong is of a different era,\" or \"It’s a different sport now.\"\n<p>The new generation of American stars like Phinney and Tejay van Garderen were only early teens in the days of darkness and - as they kept telling me - the culture has changed.\n<p>But how much? How much can we celebrate? Should we celebrate as the 100th edition of the sport’s greatest race –- the Tour de France - sets off from Corsica on June 29 –given that many of the older generation still remain?\n<p>Drugs cheat turned anti-doping campaigner David Millar is one who is concerned about the number of riders who haven’t put their hands up about doping in the past.\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2013/06/22/sport/germany-cycling-doping/\">Former Tour de France winner Ulrich admits doping</a></strong>\n<p>“I know not everybody has come forward. That unfortunately is one of the conundrums of zero tolerance.\"\n<p>And the inspirational journalist David Walsh, who dedicated his life to uncovering the truth about Armstrong, is troubled by those who remain in the more sport's senior positions.\n<p>“A lot of the people who were around, in terms of the management people, who were around in the Armstrong era are still around,\" said Walsh. \n<p>There’s no doubt that cycling has led the way in sport over recent years in the fight against drugs. It was the first to introduce the biological passport - built up by collating an athlete's drug test results over time, therefore making it easier to detect differences which could indicate the use of a banned substance.\n<p>And the Adams scheme - run in conjuction with the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) - means that riders can be tested whenever, wherever, 365 days a year.\n<p>“By and large, you compare the amount of out-of competition tests done in cycling as opposed to something like tennis and then you realize really we should be paying a lot more attention to tennis,\" said Walsh.\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/taylorphinney\">Phinney</a> tweeted during the NBA finals: “Is now an OK time to bring up the fact that NBA players are drug tested a MAX of 4X a season? I've personally been tested 3X in last 2 wks.”\n<p>However, the three positive tests during the Giro D’Italia, including that of 2007 winner Danilo Di Luca, provide evidence that cycling's anti-doping fight continues.\n<p>Though <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lancearmstrong\">Armstrong’s</a> criticism of Di Luca caused much hilarity: “Knowing I have 0 cred on the doping issue – I still can't help but think, \"really Di Luca? Are you that f*****g stupid??).\"\n<p>Di Luca, who has served a previous punishment for doping, faces a life ban if he is finally proven to have used the blood booster EPO. \n<p>So clearly it is much tougher to cheat and win now.\n<p>But for all the change amongst those powering the bikes - those with the power at the top have some serious questions left to answer.\n<p>The workings, the attitude and awareness of world cycling’s governing body was summed for me by Lance Armstrong’s face and name still being heralded on the wall in the UCI’s Hall of Fame, despite being stripped of all his Tour de France titles –- by the UCI themselves –- seven months earlier.\n<p>For all the good work that UCI president Pat McQuaid and his organization have done in the fight against drugs, the Irishman's ties with the past, his reluctance to step aside –- and his failure to understand the bigger picture - are hard to fathom.\n<p>I suppose I went along, for what was his first sit-down television interview since the scandal, hoping for some understanding of the criticism being leveled at both him and his organization –- maybe a bit of perspective on what had gone before. \n<p>Instead: \"Hindsight is an exact science and hindsight is 20-20 vision. Of course you would do things differently, but that doesn’t mean that I regret anything that I did.”\n<p>Did he ever contemplate resigning? “No, I didn’t, no. And indeed many, many federations around the world told me that under no circumstances should I contemplate resigning,” he said defiantly.\n<p>McQuaid can’t help but have heard the ever-increasing calls for his resignation. They’re becoming louder than all of those Armstrong doping denials put together.\n<p>The big unknown is how much more there is to come from Armstrong –- and the implications that has for those at the top.\n<p>Armstrong’s openly supporting the man standing against McQuaid in September’s UCI Presidential elections. And the American has called for Brian Cookson to set up a Truth and Reconciliation Commission to “FULLY understand the mistakes of previous generations”.\n<p>For all the internal struggles within cycling - on the ground at the Giro D’Italia the sport seemed as strong as ever.\n<p>It was my first experience of a major road race –- and the atmosphere, occasion, sport and spectacle gave a host of other live events a run for their money.\n<p>There are not many sports where the fans can get within touching distance and have photos with the stars just minutes before they begin competition. The daily signing in session for the riders was fantastic.\n<p>As were the pink-clad crowds 10 deep along the narrow, windy Italian village roads - despite the thunder storms.\n<p>And one of those memories I’ll never forget –- the group of fabulous Italian men who thrust plastic cups of red wine and freshly carved ham sandwiches through our car window as we were rushing to get to the finish ahead of the winner.\n<p>I'll definitely be looking at this year's Tour de France with more respect than I thought I would when I set out on this project. But ultimately cycling is a business.\n<p>Its history is littered with stories of cheating and corruption, and in this day and age of professional sport that is not the recipe to be taken seriously. \n<p>Particularly with the current leadership at the helm. As Jamie Fuller –- the man behind pressure group Change Cycling Now put it - “We believe that this is probably the last chance we've got to fix it otherwise we're going to see the sport of cycling turn into a joke.\"\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/AmandaJDavies\"><em>Follow Amanda Davies on Twitter</em></a>\n<p><em>Changing Gear runs on CNN from June 24.

They are a candidate to win the World Cup,\" added the Uruguayan.\n<p>The way Spain pass a team into submission is akin to a metronome monotonously beating out the rhythm for an aspiring piano player. Except for the tick tock of the metronome, substitute Spain’s Tiki-taka passing game.\n<p>It is a style of football that oscillates between slow passing in the search for a team’s weakness, to rapid quick-fire exchanges when that chink is discovered.\n<p>The understanding the Spanish players have of time and space seems at times almost extraterrestrial. It’s not, instead predicated on repeated practice such as <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/68503928\">El Rondo - a passing game played in a constricted space.</a>\n<p>At Euro 2012, Spain were accused of being “boring” as Vicente Del Bosque’s side landed a third successive major title.\n<p>There was nothing boring about Sunday’s win –- unless as a spectator you were turned off by the lack of resistance Uruguay managed to offer. It was that one-sided.\n<p>And this from a Spanish side that was missing key midfielder Xabi Alonso through injury, with Javi Martinez and Juan Mata starting on the bench, while the likes of goalkeeper David de Gea and attacking midfielder Isco were held back for Under-21 duty in Israel.\n<p>That duo faced Italy in UEFA’s Under-21 Championship final on Tuesday, a 4-2 victory which provided further evidence of Spain’s current strength in depth as the team - led by a hat-trick from captain Thiago Alcantara of Barcelona - defended the title won in 2011.\n<p>If Andres Iniesta was man-of-the-match in Recife, equally impressive were Fabregas and left-back Jordi Alba. That trio remorselessly exploited Uruguay’s right flank.\n<p>Yet Spain’s tendency to not finish off opponents will give the likes of Argentina and Brazil, as well as European sides such as Germany and Italy, a glimmer of hope that the 2014 World Cup will not end with La Roja successfully defending the title they won in South Africa.\n<p>\"We should have scored more and maybe we were tired and also as a result of winning 2-0, that affects the players - they start to slow down and that is why we suffered at the end,” admitted Del Bosque.\n<p>Soldado might have scored against Uruguay, but there is a sense that the hunt for a striker to finish off Spain’s intricate passing moves goes on.\n<p>David Villa has struggled to return to form after suffering a broken leg, while Fernando Torres’ own search for the form that terrorized defenders when he was at Liverpool continues in vain.\n<p>However, Spain's opponents will first need to get the ball off Del Bosque's bewitching team if that weakness is to be exploited.\n<br> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/cnniworldsport.wordpress.com/9223/\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/cnniworldsport.wordpress.com/9223/\" border=\"0\"></a> <img height=\"1\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=worldsport.blogs.cnn.com&blog=8188608&post=9223&subd=cnniworldsport&ref=&feed=1\" border=\"0\"><img height=\"1\" width=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/rss/edition_worldsportblog/~4/nkiY6YrQAmY\">","direction":"ltr"},"published":1371561668000,"crawled":1371563007580,"alternate":[{"href":"http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_worldsportblog/~3/nkiY6YrQAmY/","type":"text/html"}],"canonical":[{"href":"http://worldsport.blogs.cnn.com/2013/06/18/can-anyone-stop-spain-at-2014-world-cup/","type":"text/html"}],"author":"jsinnottcnn","origin":{"streamId":"feed/http://rss.cnn.com/rss/edition_worldsportblog.rss","htmlUrl":"http://worldsport.blogs.cnn.com","title":"CNN World Sport"},"summary":{"content":"The final of the 2014 World Cup in Brazil’s Maracana stadium in Rio de Janeiro is just over a year away, but already it’s difficult to look any further than Spain as tournament winners.

The football stars of the future are on display in Israel - and they’re lighting up the UEFA Under-21 Championship in style.\n<p>Having spent the past week in Tel Aviv covering the tournament for CNN, it’s given me a great opportunity to take a look at some of the top prospects coming through onto the international stage.\n<p>Some of the biggest names in the game have forged their reputations at this tournament and I’ve picked out a few “ones to watch” following the opening week’s action.<span></span> I'd also love to hear who has caught your eye. Any player born on or after January 1, 1990 is eligible to play in the tournament, which is held every two years.\n<p>While Spain and Netherlands have both looked hugely impressive in the group stage, Italy have also cruised through their opening fixtures.\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ireport.cnn.com/\">iReport: Are you in Israel at the U21 tournament?</a>\n<p>The “Azzurrini” have plenty of talent to choose from but it is Napoli’s Lorenzo Insigne who has stood out for me.\n<p>At 22, with the bad-boy haircut and a whole host of tattoos, the Naples-born starlet looks every inch the part - but where he differs is that he produces.\n<p>Against England, he ran defenders ragged before popping up with the winner.\n<p>The ball appears to be tied to his laces, he moves so effortlessly and his awareness is at a different level when it comes to decision making.\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.edition.cnn.com/2013/05/28/sport/football/rafael-benitez-napoli-chelsea-football/index.html\">New Napoli boss Rafa Benitez</a> has inherited an absolute gem in Insigne, who should he continue at this rate of progress, will surely go on to greater things.\n<p>Another player who has wowed the masses is the mercurial talent that is Isco.\n<p>Spain’s insistence on its top, young players taking part in this tournament has led to its national side dominating in recent years. It’s hardly a coincidence.\n<p>Bayern Munich’s Javi Martinez and Chelsea star Juan Mata shone for La Roja at this tournament in 2011. The likes of David De Gea, already a regular with Manchester United, Thiago Alcantara at Barcelona and Athletic Bilbao’s Iker Munian are already household names across Europe.\n<p>Isco, who shot to prominence during Malaga’s run to the quarterfinals of the Champions League, is seemingly destined to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.edition.cnn.com/2013/05/22/sport/football/malaga-pellegrini-mancini-uefa-ban/index.html\">follow coach Manuel Pellegrini to Manchester City before the start of next season</a>.\n<p>His eye for goal, exquisite first touch and ability to thread passes through the eye of a needle make him one of the most exciting talents in European football.\n<p>But it’s the performances of Real Sociedad's holding midfielder Asier Illarramendi which has got tongues wagging. His defensive positioning, especially in the opening 1-0 win over Russia, was sublime - as was his passing, which allowed Spain to move from back to front in rapid fashion.\n<p>By snuffing out attacks and shielding the defense, Illarramendi eased the pressure on his team before taking it upon himself to get Spain moving forward with devastating passing accuracy.\n<p>At 23, he is already being compared to Barcelona’s Sergio Busquets and, with Sociedad having qualified for next season’s Champions League, don’t be surprised to see a number of “bigger” clubs linked with Illarramendi.\n<p>The only team which appears ready to challenge the Spanish is the Netherlands, which has also won its first two games of the competition.\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2013/06/06/sport/football/israel-sarsak-uefa-u21-football/index.html\">Should soccer boycott Israel's European Championship?</a>\n<p>Midfielders Adam Maher and Leroy Fer have both furthered their cases for big-money moves, while forward Georginio Wijnaldum looks a class act in the making.\n<p>But Manchester United target Kevin Strootman is the one to watch. With 18 senior caps to his name and the captain’s armband, Strootman looks mature beyond his years.\n<p>At 23, he has progressed from a box-to-box midfielder at Sparta Rotterdam to a deep-lying playmaker at PSV Eindhoven. His vision and passing ability is at a level rarely seen in someone so young and he would easily adapt to the physical nature of the English Premier League.\n<p>One team which has really flown under the radar is Norway, which trounced England 3-1 in some style.\n<p>A solid defense and the goalscoring nous of Marcus Pedersen has seen the Norwegians all but qualify for the semifinals.\n<p>“He’s so big and strong, difficult to defend against,” one coach said of Pedersen. “He knows where the goal is and he’ll go back to playing in Holland next year with Vitesse after a year on loan in Denmark. Next season, there will be a lot of people talking about this guy.”\n<p>Harmeet Singh, Valon Berisha, Harvard Nordveit are all promising talents, while there is a lot of excitement over 19-year-old winger Havard Nielsen.\n<p>It’s difficult to see this tournament finishing without a Spain vs. Netherlands final - although Italy, with the likes of Insigne and Marco Verratti could run both countries close.\n<p>But which players have you enjoyed watching?

The 2013 German title was won by a record-breaking margin as Bayern finished 25 points clear of Borussia Dortmund.\n<p>Bayern beat Stuttgart last weekend to lift the German Cup and, sandwiched in between those twin triumphs, the Bavarians defeated Dortmund in the first all-German Champions League final to become kings of Europe for a fifth time.\n<p>The mastermind behind this unprecedented treble was 68-year-old Jupp Heynckes, Bayern’s very own “Doc Brown” who returned to the club he previously coached two decades earlier to achieve historic success.\n<p>Heynckes, who won two Bundesliga titles during his first spell as Bayern coach between 1987 and 1991, returned in 2011. His arrival followed the departure of Louis van Gaal, who had presided over an unacceptable third-place finish in the league.\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.edition.cnn.com/2013/06/03/sport/football/football-mourinho-chelsea-special/index.html\">Why 'Special One' needs to be loved</a>\n<p>Heynckes’ first season back at the helm ended in heartbreak. Bayern finished second in the Bundesliga, behind Dortmund, and suffered a crushing Champions League final defeat to Roberto Di Matteo’s Chelsea team in their own Allianz Arena Stadium.\n<p>While the club’s players and fans plunged the depth of despair, Heynckes steeled himself for a monumental comeback.\n<p>The power of his all-conquering 2013 team was at its most apparent during a 7-0 aggregate thrashing of Barcelona in the Champions League semifinal.\n<p>Barca, the team roundly accepted as the best in the world up to that point, had seen their mantel stolen by Heynckes’ red and white juggernaut. The veteran’s return instilled a confidence and a swagger into a team which was in danger of going down in history as chokers.\n<p>Heynckes’ achievements were such that, prior to announcing he would take a break from the sport, there was talk he might return to another old stomping ground.\n<p>He was hotly-tipped to replace Mourinho at Real Madrid, a club where he won the Champions League in 1998.\n<p>Chelsea’s decision to get back with an ex comes after six years which have seen seven managers try to work under the shadow cast by Mourinho's departure.\n<img height=\"382\" alt=\"\" width=\"585\" src=\"http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2013/images/06/03/chelsea.blog.jpg\" border=\"0\">\n<p>Success has remained consistent. Since 2007 Chelsea have enjoyed a first Champions League triumph in addition to a Europa League win, a Premier League title and three FA Cups.\n<p>In the last two seasons, however, Chelsea have been nowhere near the top of the Premier League table.\n<p>The two Manchester clubs have battled for supremacy, while Chelsea floundered in sixth in 2012 and finished third in 2013.\n<p>Chelsea have suffered an identity crisis without Mourinho and he will be pleased some of his most loyal disciples remain stationed at Stamford Bridge.\n<p>Goalkeeper Petr Cech, defender Ashley Cole and stalwarts John Terry and Frank Lampard will know what it takes to succeed under Mourinho and they could be key in creating a sense of togetherness in what often seems a fractured dressing room.\n<p>For Chelsea owner Abramovich, he will be hoping the rehiring of a man he sacked six years ago can lead to more European Cup success.\n<p>The second coming of Jose will be judged on whether he can finally lead the team to Champions League success after failing to get beyond the semifinals during his first spell in charge.\n<p>Mourinho will have an early opportunity to demonstrate he is capable of filling the only gap in his Chelsea resume when his team head to Monaco for August’s European Super Cup final.\n<p>Their opponents?

(Getty Images)</div></div>\n<p>How much faith do you have in FIFA? Can we as fans really believe football's overlords are in it for the good of the game? Now the 63rd Annual FIFA Congress has been and gone - how much has really changed? It was a summit sold on its significance for world soccer's much trumpeted reform plan, but should we all have saved our air fares?\n<p>Given Sepp Blatter invited us to the wonder that is Mauritius for this year's annual meeting of football's parliament, I feel it's only right to contemplate this question from the comfort of a sun bed, with cocktail in hand.<span></span>\n<p>These reforms came about after the cash for votes scandals and corruption that led Blatter to talk of stormy seas in Zurich two years ago. On Friday, world football's president said, \"Hopefully FIFA is now as clear and transparent as the waters that surround\" Mauritius. It is undoubtedly an island that can make your troubles go away, but it would take a considerable dose of sun stroke to make me believe everything is well at FIFA.\n<p>Even before half the delegates had landed - quicker than you could say Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam International Airport - the issues of age limits and term lengths had been postponed by the Executive Committee. A sign that 77-year-old Blatter is indeed going to stand for a record fifth term of office? European football showed exactly what they thought of that - and abstained en masse from the vote.\n<div><a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/video/#/video/sports/2013/05/31/davies-fifa-racism-reforms-webb.cnn\">Click to watch video</a></div>\n<p>There are those who say that's indicative of the last two years. German journalist Florian Bauer told me this week, \"Personally I wouldn't call it a reform process, because then you would ask where are the reforms?\" He feels that while FIFA has said the right things on the surface, in reality little has changed. \"They haven't even heard the proposals of their own advisers - the Independent Governance Committeee (the IGC). You're paying people, the IGC, to be advisers - then they're proposing things, but you are not acknowledging them. This was meant to be a reform Congress - the end of a reform process - now FIFA has changed its mind.\"\n<p>FIFA reminded us courtesy of a natty graphic that the glass of reform is more half full than half empty in terms of what's been done. And it is true that there have been changes to the World Cup voting system, new integrity checks implemented, and a new code of ethics for the committee.\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2013/05/31/sport/blatter-fifa-racism/index.html\">FIFA adopts tougher racism punishment</a>s\n<p>Blatter insists the process continues because there's more to be done. Surely that recognition should be applauded. IGC chairman Mark Pieth said \"critics have to realize this is a self-governing reform, and FIFA is a complicated organization. We are confronted by the proverbial supertanker trying to change course.\" It was reassuring to hear him calling once again for transparency with pay and remuneration too. But the proof is in the pay checks. And whether or not we actually get to see them.\n<p>Aside from the reforms - there have been some big decisions here in Mauritius. They've firmly drawn a line in the sand (beautiful sand it is too) in terms of passing the sanctions against racism and discrimination.\n<p>But for me, FIFA's fight for credibility, and its battle to win back the belief of the football faithful, was summed up after eight and a half hours of congress - with one unscripted moment.\n<p>The appointment of Burundi's Lydia Nsekera as the first full female member on the Executive Committee is long overdue. A moment to be celebrated.

But which of the players on the move has captured your imagination?<span></span>\n<p>In the Bundesliga Mario Gotze has confirmed his move from Champions League nearly men Borussia Dortmund to newly-crowned European champions Bayern Munich in a deal worth $40m. \n<p>The 20-year-old was a stand-out performer for his side this year knocking in 10 goals in 28 league appearances, not bad for a midfielder who was side-lined in the season-ending finale.\n<p>It may not be the end of the bad news for Die Schwarzgelben boss Jurgen Klopp either, <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2013/05/25/sport/football/football-champions-league/\">a man still reeling from missing out on club football’s top prize</a>, as many pundits predict Polish goal-getter Robert Lewandowski could head to Munich as well.\n<p>The 24-year-old sparkled in the Champions League and found the net 24 times in the Bundesliga, his current valuation of just under $40m by TransferMarkt seems a snip in the current market.\n<div><img height=\"382\" alt=\"Transfer values taken from Transfermarkt.com.\" width=\"585\" src=\"http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2013/images/05/30/blog.chart.jpg\" border=\"0\"><div>Transfer values taken from Transfermarkt.com.</div></div>\n<p>In Spain, the signing of Brazilian star Neymar to Barcelona for a package reported to be close to $100m has created the salivating prospect of “one of the most promising footballers on the planet” linking up with arguably the current best-in-the-world, Lionel Messi. \n<p>Neymar, as poster boy for the 2014 World Cup, was recently ranked as <a href=\"http://www.sportspromedia.com/notes_and_insights/neymar_is_the_worlds_most_marketable_athlete/\">the world’s most marketable athlete by Sports Pro magazine</a> - using criteria such as value for money, age, home market, charisma, willingness to be marketed and crossover appeal - so you would imagine the Catalans will be hoping for a business return on their investment as well as entertainment on the pitch.\n<p>As a new star rises in the Spanish top division another could be leaving with Atletico Madrid striker Radamel Falcao hotly-tipped to join Monaco, a side boosted by the large investments of their Russian billionaire owner. \n<p>The Colombian’s scoring rate is awesome in La Liga and he would add talent to a side that has also recently acquired Joao Moutinho and James Rodriguez for an eye-watering $91m from Porto. \n<p>According to reports in France a five-year-deal and $75m buy-out has been agreed. How long he stays in the principality remains to be seen, however, as it seems curious that a player with the footballing world at his feet would not chose a more established Champions League contender as an employer.\n<p>In England, Manchester United’s incoming manager David Moyes has a want-away England striker Wayne Rooney to deal with when he picks up the reins left by Alex Ferguson. \n<p>Many feel the change in leadership could see Cesc Fabregas or Cristiano Ronaldo make Old Trafford their home. Certainly, Rooney has not given the value for money to his club in terms of goals that his contemporaries in Europe have this season. \n<p>It’s also the second transfer request he has handed in three years, a move that has soured his relationship with Red Devil fans. Arguably, it could be a good time for Moyes to cash in. \n<p>And if he’s got money to spend then why not join the queue for Tottenham’s hotshot Gareth Bale. The Welshman bagged 21 goals - many of them spectacular - in 33 games for the London side during this campaign, becoming a talismanic figure in the process. \n<p>The attacking midfielder’s versatility has got teams from Manchester City to Real Madrid champing at the bit to get his signature. \n<p>If he is to leave Spurs it will be for big money as the player’s agent - Jonathan Barnett - told Marca TV: “It’s crazy but whatever Neymar cost - Gareth Bale is worth more.” Only time will tell whether this proves true.\n<p>Finally, Rafael Benitez may have left England on a high but he’ll be hoping to dent Chelsea’s nose by warding them off his Napoli superstar Edinson Cavani. \n<p>If British press are to be believed big-spending Manchester City are also in the chase for the Uruguayan who was the top scorer in Serie A last season. Valued at twice the price of Lewandowski, he will have pressure to deliver if he moves. \n<br> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/cnniworldsport.wordpress.com/9184/\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/cnniworldsport.wordpress.com/9184/\" border=\"0\"></a> <img height=\"1\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=worldsport.blogs.cnn.com&blog=8188608&post=9184&subd=cnniworldsport&ref=&feed=1\" border=\"0\"><img height=\"1\" width=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/rss/edition_worldsportblog/~4/fp90NW_PvVM\">","direction":"ltr"},"title":"Neymar move to spark a summer of transfer sagas?","published":1369910536000,"alternate":[{"href":"http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_worldsportblog/~3/fp90NW_PvVM/","type":"text/html"}],"canonical":[{"href":"http://worldsport.blogs.cnn.com/2013/05/30/neymar-move-to-spark-a-summer-of-transfer-sagas/","type":"text/html"}],"author":"tommcgowan","crawled":1369910536000,"origin":{"streamId":"feed/http://rss.cnn.com/rss/edition_worldsportblog.rss","htmlUrl":"http://worldsport.blogs.cnn.com","title":"CNN World Sport"},"summary":{"content":"It’s traditional at this time of the year that rumblings and rumors in the football transfer market turn to reality.

Now think about it for just a moment.  Would that really be enough for the new franchise’s owners?  Remember who they are after all!  Manchester City belong to Sheikh Mansour and as a club – in terms of spending prowess- money is truly no object - and he will demand success. \n<p>And what should we make of the Yankees involvement in all this? I still recall their marketing tie- in with Manchester’s “other” club United back in the early 2000s. It didn’t last and there always seemed to be a lack of clarity over how it all worked? \n<p><a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2013/05/13/sport/football/football-manchester-city-sack-roberto-mancini/index.html?iref=allsearch\">Read: Manchester City sack manager Roberto Mancini</a>\n<p>Will things be different this time around?

Not an MLS franchise in sight.\n<p>Why? Where I live in Atlanta I'd have to travel some nine hours by car to go and watch my \"local\" team- DC United in Washington!\n<p>Having grown up in North West England- the City fans I know would never have dreamed of seeing the day their club would launch a spin-off franchise in the United States - with the added benefit of being able to loan out players to the MLS side.    \n<p>Most I'm quite sure would rather the club be fully focused on prioritizing the search for a new manager or improving their woeful recent Champions League record.\n<p>In fact- they might even  be wondering  if they'll possibly even get to see Yankees baseball at the Etihad some day!\n<p>I have no doubt the MLS' newest franchise will soon become the league's undisputed super-power backed by the world-wide might of City and the Yankees.\n<p>I'm left with this nagging doubt though.

Considering all the money I could make foretelling events in the coming days, weeks, months and years to come I would ideally work less than a sloth on strike. Clearly then, this is not a superpower I possess. However, though I can’t tell you exactly what will occur in this weekend’s UEFA Champions League Final between Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund, I can make an informed guess; so that is what I am going to do.\n<p>So let’s start with the score. I think Bayern will beat their Bundesliga rivals 2-1 so it will be the Bavarians celebrating their fifth European Crown when the dust settles at Wembley on Saturday night.\n<p>Bayern will win because they have been the best team in the competition: simple. They have won nine of their 12 games, have scored more goals and conceded less than any other side. They have shown they can dominate games by hogging most of the possession while also being effective as a counter-attacking team against Barcelona. This is a well-oiled machine, which plays to its strengths and seems to score at will against any opposition.\n<a name=\"pd_a_7119055\"></a>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n<noscript><a href=\"http://polldaddy.com/poll/7119055\">Take Our Poll</a></noscript>\n<p>The key to Bayern’s success this season has been their wing play. Most of their attacks are conducted down both wings and they rely on deadly combinations between the full backs and wingers to create two-on-one situations around the opposition’s box. We all know Franck Ribery and Arjen Robben create goal-scoring chances, but what full backs Phillip Lahm and David Alaba have done is quite extraordinary. They combine for six assists in 12 Champions League games this season.\n<blockquote><p><span></span><em><em><b>Ben's stats breakdown: Bayern ...</b></em><br>\n</em>\n<div><i>Bayern Munich are blessed with some of the finest wingers in world football. Dutch flyer Arjen Robben and Franck Ribery of France both have pace, ingenuity and goal-scoring ability. But what makes Bayern particularly potent is the support given by fullbacks Philippe Lahm and David Alaba on the right and left respectively. As the youngest starter in either side, 20-year-old Alaba has been dubbed one of the “biggest talents in European football” by Bayern executive Karl-Heinz Rummenigge and retained his Austrian footballer of the year title in 2013. Lahm, captain of both his nation and his club, has been one of Germany’s brightest stars for nearly a decade, making the tournament best XI picks for the 2006 and 2010 World Cups. The master full back and his apprentice offer solid defence but attack with intelligence, often overlapping on the flank to cross with their natural feet to the likes of Thomas Muller and Mario Mandzukic, while Robben or Ribery cut in to the middle to fire in long-range shots <strong>(see tactics board below)</strong>. The stats back up this assessment too: the four wide men make up five of Bayern’s top crossers in the competition, Bayern have scored more headed goals than any other team in the tournament (5) and Robben (54) and Ribery (34) both make the top five shot takers for Bayern. Crucially coach Jupp Heynckes has instilled a strong work ethic in all four players, even the once lazy Robben, which means there is a good sharing of defensive and attacking duties as demand dictates.</i></div>\n<img height=\"382\" alt=\"\" width=\"585\" src=\"http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2013/images/05/21/bayern-tactics2.jpg\" border=\"0\">\n<p>One can’t talk about the German champions without praising Thomas Muller. He has been their most valuable player this season. The young forward has contributed eight goals and two assists while running further than any other Bayern player in the competition. He can play anywhere across the front line and will be crucial to his side’s success this weekend.\n<p>If there is one major concern Bayern has heading into this final, it is how they are going to overcome their previous failures. Most of the players who are lining up on Saturday have lost two finals, one to Inter Milan in 2010 and another to Chelsea at home in 2012. So if I am Jupp Heynckes right now, I am doing my best to make sure that the players have learned from their mistakes and forget about their final defeats. Otherwise, the doubt and fear of losing another title match could hinder the players’ performance.\n<p>So what about Dortmund, do they stand a chance? Of course they do, but they will have to be as effective as they were in their 4-1 win over Real Madrid in the first leg of the semi-finals. The fact is that Borussia are not going to boss the game on Saturday. They are going to rely mostly on quick counter-attacks to inflict damage on their rival’s defence.\n<blockquote><p><em><b>Ben's stats breakdown: Dortmund ...</b></em>\n<div><i>Where Bayern Munich boast a well-oiled winning machine, strong from front to back, Dortmund are blessed with stand-out individuals that can turn a game with a stroke of brilliance and have a youthful, never-say-die attitude on their side. In fact, they’ll be the youngest side to lift the trophy since Real Madrid in 2000 if they clinch victory. Robert Lewandowski has been the Champions League stand-out striker in many ways this season and could become the competition’s top goal scorer if he bags a hat-trick (to surpass Ronaldo’s 12) in the final. He’s particularly dangerous from crosses, scoring one in two goals from this source. What’s maybe more impressive about the Pole is his all-round capabilities; he tops the charts for the whole Champions League in terms of challenges won. When Lewandowski is hot he’s unstoppable, just ask Real who he knocked four past in the first leg of the semifinal with typically predatory panache. Aside from the striker, could the imminent departure of Mario Gotze add impetus to his final performance? Bayern should be worried if it does as the midfield maestro’s stats shows that he has been key to his side’s attacks this season (he tops Dortmund’s crosses, assists and shots assists lists for his side). Keep an eye on Marco Reus, the 23-year-old who is Dortmund’s next go-to man for goals behind Lewandowski. The intelligent attacking midfielder is tireless in application (26 shots assists, 4 goals and 52 shots in total), deft of touch and often moves in positions that are hard to mark for defenders who aren’t cute <strong>(see Reaus's heat map from the semifinal first leg below - shooting left to right - that shows his pitch-wide positions)</strong>. He could prove key in unsettling Lahm from his game. Remember too that on form and on paper Bayern were the favourites against Chelsea last year too, and we all know how that turned out.</i></div>\n<img height=\"382\" alt=\"\" width=\"585\" src=\"http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2013/images/05/21/reus-heat.jpg\" border=\"0\">\n<p>Don’t take my word for it, just check out the stats. In the games leading up to the final, Dortmund averaged only 44% possession, only better than four of the 32 teams who played in the Champions League. Their passing completion percentage was also below average, only 66%. So in other words, they normally like to sit back, stay compact, and then launch quick and direct counter attacks depending on the individual talent of their forwards to make the difference.\n<p>And when we speak about individual talent, there are three players who I would like to focus on: Mario Gotze, Robert Lewandowski and Ilkay Gundogan. Gotze, if fit enough to play on Saturday, will be responsible for creating chances in the final third; Lewandowski will have to find space to be in the right place at the right time to finish those chances; and Gundogan is there to set the rhythm and the tone of his side’s attacking and defending. If Dortmund are going to win this game, then these three players will have to be at their best.\n<p>So those are my thoughts heading into Saturday’s Bundesliga Battle. If Bayern win, like I am predicting they will, the Bavarians will take another step towards securing an unprecedented treble: league, domestic cup and Champions League. If they lose, they will have to deal with earning the tag of chokers, as it will have been their third final defeat in four years.\n<br> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/cnniworldsport.wordpress.com/9138/\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/cnniworldsport.wordpress.com/9138/\" border=\"0\"></a> <img height=\"1\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=worldsport.blogs.cnn.com&blog=8188608&post=9138&subd=cnniworldsport&ref=&feed=1\" border=\"0\"><img height=\"1\" width=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/rss/edition_worldsportblog/~4/amAn7rZHXGk\"></blockquote></blockquote>","direction":"ltr"},"title":"Pedro's POV: And this year's European champions will be ...","published":1369148804000,"alternate":[{"href":"http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_worldsportblog/~3/amAn7rZHXGk/","type":"text/html"}],"canonical":[{"href":"http://worldsport.blogs.cnn.com/2013/05/21/pedros-pov-and-this-years-european-champions-will-be/","type":"text/html"}],"author":"tommcgowan","crawled":1369148804000,"origin":{"streamId":"feed/http://rss.cnn.com/rss/edition_worldsportblog.rss","htmlUrl":"http://worldsport.blogs.cnn.com","title":"CNN World Sport"},"summary":{"content":"Let’s face it, if I could predict the future I would not be working as a sports journalist.

Namely, which manager failed most to live-up to their pre-season goals? After all, this is the question that preoccupies the myriad of club owners across Europe.<span></span>\n<a name=\"pd_a_7100370\"></a>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n<noscript><a href=\"http://polldaddy.com/poll/7100370\">Take Our Poll</a></noscript>\n<p>Failure can be so subjective, so potentially the best bar to provide a measure of successless shepherds is to focus on the value for money they gave back to their sides. If transfer spending against progress in Europe’s top club competition is mapped the following four were rightly in the firing line*:\n<p><strong>4. Alex Ferguson – Manchester United: </strong><br>\nHe may have been the greatest manager to grace British football and a two-time winner of the Champions League but \"Fergie\" had seen diminishing returns from his forays into Europe in the last two seasons of his tenure. A sizeable $103m were spent over the last campaign bringing in players such as goal-getter Robin Van Persie and goal-stopper David De Gea.\n<p>In return United failed at the group stages last year and were knocked out before the quarterfinals in 2013. No wonder the great Scot was left devastated by the Real Madrid defeat this time around, by his own standards the Red Devils had not delivered. <strong>Future – Retires at end of season</strong>\n<p><strong>3. Roberto Mancini – Manchester City: </strong><br>\nThe blue half of Manchester are relative newcomers to Champions League combat, so that may be a mitigating factor for failure, but what they lacked in experience they surely made up for in player spending power. An outlay of over $230m in the last two seasons by Italian coach Roberto Mancini, not to mention the capture of the English Premier League title, had seen expectations soar as high as the players’ wage bill at Eastlands. And sadly, for their followers, this campaign saw the disappointment of a winless group stage and stunted progress in Europe once again.\n<p>Jack Rodwell, Maicon, Scott Sinclair, Matja Nastasic and Javi Garcia were all brought to the club for $84m but failed to propel the Sky Blues past the group stages at the second time of asking. Mancini’s critics will point to his limited success with Inter Milan in the same competition too. The timing and delivery of the termination may have been less than tender but is it any wonder the owners decided to wield the axe?*<br>\n<strong>Future – Unemployed after being sacked by City</strong>\n<p><strong>2. Luciano Spalletti – Zenit St. Petersburg:</strong><br>\nThe 54-year-old Italian manager joined the Russian side in 2009 but in a show of enhanced ambition the national champions splashed out $140m in the last year on player firepower, including the signings of such luminaries as Brazilian striker Hulk and Alex Witsel of Belgium.\n<p>Despite such investment, and with promise to be the dark horses with designs on shaking up the old order, Zenit flattered to deceive. They notched up just two wins in six groups games, with Hulk scoring only once in five outings, and conceded nine. As club captain Danny concluded at the end of the campaign: \"Considering the quality we have in this team we could have done much better.\" <strong>Future – Linked to Chelsea, Roma and AC Milan</strong>\n<p><strong>1. Roberto Di Matteo – Chelsea: </strong><br>\nNever before have the reigning champions of Europe been booted out of the competition at the first opportunity, but such was the fate of 2012’s unlikely title-holders from London. The football world marvelled at the ability of the 42-year-old manager Di Matteo to cajole a dispirited team and defeat the mighty Bayern Munich in last year’s final.\n<p>It then scratched its head in disbelief as the Italian’s - albeit inherited - team failed to fire despite over $153m of investment in the last 12 months. Di Matteo was dumped from the club shortly before Chelsea were dumped out the group stage. Whoever takes over next season will be expected to considerably improve on that return. <strong>Future – Currently unemployed </strong>\n<p>*Updates made in light of the sacking of Roberto Mancini by Manchester City.\n<p><a href=\"http://footballclub.cnn.com/\"><img height=\"174\" alt=\"cnnfc.promo\" width=\"600\" src=\"http://cnniworldsport.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/cnnfc-promo.jpg?w=600&h=174\"></a>\n<br> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/cnniworldsport.wordpress.com/9125/\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/cnniworldsport.wordpress.com/9125/\" border=\"0\"></a> <img height=\"1\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=worldsport.blogs.cnn.com&blog=8188608&post=9125&subd=cnniworldsport&ref=&feed=1\" border=\"0\"><img height=\"1\" width=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/rss/edition_worldsportblog/~4/Uvt6A2O18x8\">","direction":"ltr"},"title":"Managing success: Man City right to ax Mancini?","published":1368462045000,"alternate":[{"href":"http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_worldsportblog/~3/Uvt6A2O18x8/","type":"text/html"}],"canonical":[{"href":"http://worldsport.blogs.cnn.com/2013/05/13/managing-success-the-champions-league-biggest-coaching-flops/","type":"text/html"}],"author":"tommcgowan","crawled":1368462045000,"origin":{"streamId":"feed/http://rss.cnn.com/rss/edition_worldsportblog.rss","htmlUrl":"http://worldsport.blogs.cnn.com","title":"CNN World Sport"},"summary":{"content":"As the end of another UEFA Champions League campaign draws to a climactic close, it’s traditional to assess those that stood above others with their contribution of exceptional performance, inspired tactics and delivery of dramatic moments.

The Bavarians were particularly impressive over the last two rounds, beating Juventus and Barcelona with aggregate scores of 4-0 and 7-0.\n<p>What about Dortmund? Well as entertaining and dynamic as they have been, and as well as Mario Gotze and Robert Lewandowski have played on the way to the final, I decided my MVP had to be a Bayern player.\n<p>So who did I pick? Well, there were a few candidates. At the back, Dante and Philipp Lahm have been outstanding; in midfield, Bastian Schweinsteiger has pulled the strings magnificently; while on the wings, Franck Ribery and Arjen Robben have both had moments of brilliance.\n<p>However, in my opinion, the MVP of this season’s Champions League has been Thomas Muller.\n<p>First of all, let’s look at the numbers. For starters, the 23-year-old is the only outfield player to have played all 12 of Bayern’s games in the competition this season.\n<p>He is their top scorer, with eight goals, and contributed two assists. Muller has also covered more distance, 127 km, than any other player on his team.\n<p>They say the numbers don’t lie and they definitely tell a story of a player who has been incredibly influential in his side’s run to the final.\n<p>Of course statistics are only part of the story and when talking about Muller, one can’t forget about what makes him so special and that is his versatility. After all, this is a player who can play anywhere across the front line. He can line up as a left winger, right winger, attacking midfielder or striker and be equally effective.\n<p>It’s not just his high level of skill that allows him to adapt to his different roles, it is also his sophisticated football IQ.\n<p>Muller has an excellent sense of positioning and has shown repeatedly he can be at the right place at the right time in key contests.\n<p>He is a guy who can show up at the near post to score with a flick, stay on the edge of the area and hit the back of the net with a powerful shot, or pop up at the far post to tap in a cross. Just ask Barcelona…\n<p>So there you have it. Thomas Muller is my pick. What do you think?

(Getty Images).</div></div>\n<p>With its youth system, strong national team, and financial prudence as well as the entertaining style of football employed by both the country's international side and its top clubs, it's not difficult to understand why Germany has been branded a soccer success.\n<p>And it is. Just not as much as we perceive it to be. Yet.\n<p>While the march of Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund to Wembley has been thrilling to watch, it's too early to tick the box marked \"Era of German domination.\"<span></span>\n<p>Bayern's haul of four European Cups is impressive but Liverpool, A.C.Milan and Real Madrid have all done better. And the Munich giants haven't conquered the continent since 2001.\n<p>Only two other German clubs have also won the tournament whereas England has produced five different champions.\n<p>In total, German sides have only six titles between them, well behind Italy and England, with 12, and Spain's 13.\n<p>Even the much vaunted Die Mannschaft can't claim to be the best ever international team. Their tally of three World Cup victories is impressive, but they last won the event in 1990, almost a quarter of a century ago.\n<p>Brazil, France, Italy and Spain have all enjoyed periods of international superiority since then.\n<p>However, no-one can equal Germany's record of 12 top-four finishes in World Cups and that consistency is now allied to, arguably, the most exciting crop of young footballers the country has ever produced.\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://worldsport.blogs.cnn.com/2013/04/30/is-the-champions-league-a-prelude-to-german-world-cup-triumph/\">As my CNN colleague Tom McGowan wrote this week, Germany have strength in depth from defense to attack.</a> Manuel Neuer, Matts Hummels, Iklay Gundogan, Mario Gotze, Marco Reus and Thomas Muller, to name but a handful, make national team coach Joachim Low the envy of his peers.\n<p>Germany's youth system and the relative buoyancy of its national economy are two key reasons behind their football ascendency. Any talent identification manager will tell you that growing a sport and improving standards is a numbers game. In essence, the more youngsters who play, the more stars you'll end up with.\n<p>Germany has tapped into its large Turkish, Polish and African immigrant population. And the scary thing is, it could do better. Being born in the country doesn't automatically entitle you to German citizenship. You have to apply for it.\n<p>That process is bound to dissuade some immigrants' children, although plenty still choose to play for Germany rather than the nation where their parents or grandparents are from.\n<p>Mesut Ozil and Sami Khedira are two examples, although their stock has fallen slightly since their move to Real Madrid. And that's where my point about the economy comes in. Many Spanish football experts I've spoken to this week insist their country's austerity measures are having a negative impact on the clubs. Although the financial weakness of La Liga, Real and Barcelona apart, is not a new thing.\n<p>In contrast, Germany is dealing with the global economic downturn better than many other nations and the Bundesliga is one of the best run leagues in the world.\n<p>According to accountant Deloitte's reputable Sports Business group, Germany's Bundesliga is only the fourth richest in Europe behind England, Spain and France.\n<p>However, it's growing fast. It already has the best attendances of any of its European rivals while revenues for the entire league broke the $2.6 billion barrier for the first time last season.\n<p>So that's the reality, but let's return to the perception or, if you like, the X-Factor that German football has always had.\n<p>I was amused to see <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://twitter.com/GaryLineker\">former England striker Gary Lineker's name trending on Twitter </a>during Bayern's first-leg demolition of Barcelona.\n<p>It was down to fans poking fun at Barca defender Gerard Piqué who claimed, before the game, that Lineker's famous quote - \"Football's a simple game. You play for 90 minutes and then the Germans win\" - isn't true any longer.\n<p>After a 7-0 aggregate thrashing and the first all-German Champions League final, it's never felt more true.\n<p>It used to be a soccer stereotype. A slightly lazy cliche that didn't always bear close scrutiny: Germany always winning at football.\n<p>Yet, as Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund imperiously brushed aside La Liga's leading clubs in the UEFA Champions League semifinals, the reality is coming close to matching that perception.\n<p>We've seen all-Spanish, English and Italian finals in the Champions League. Now, for the first time, a deutsches derby will decide who is the best club side in Europe.\n<br> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/cnniworldsport.wordpress.com/9100/\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/cnniworldsport.wordpress.com/9100/\" border=\"0\"></a> <img height=\"1\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=worldsport.blogs.cnn.com&blog=8188608&post=9100&subd=cnniworldsport&ref=&feed=1\" border=\"0\"><img height=\"1\" width=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/rss/edition_worldsportblog/~4/eW3MTtYoLIE\">","direction":"ltr"},"title":"European football braced for era of German domination?","published":1367498934000,"alternate":[{"href":"http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_worldsportblog/~3/eW3MTtYoLIE/","type":"text/html"}],"canonical":[{"href":"http://worldsport.blogs.cnn.com/2013/05/02/9100/","type":"text/html"}],"author":"jsinnottcnn","crawled":1367498934000,"origin":{"streamId":"feed/http://rss.cnn.com/rss/edition_worldsportblog.rss","htmlUrl":"http://worldsport.blogs.cnn.com","title":"CNN World Sport"},"summary":{"content":"With its youth system, strong national team, and financial prudence as well as the entertaining style of football employed by both the country's international side and its top clubs, it's not difficult to understand why Germany has been branded a soccer success.

The 2011 signing from Nuremberg looked at home in the heart of a high-stakes midfield contest and outshone his Spanish counterpart Xabi Alonso.\n<p>Ronaldo’s only moment of joy came following a rare lapse in concentration from Mats Hummels, a young defender who is reportedly attracting admiring glances from Catalonia.\n<p>A 4-1 defeat for Madrid and a 4-0 loss for Barca would have had their Spanish stars sweating over an humiliating Champions League exit.\n<p>But perhaps the bigger question mark hangs over La Roja’s reign at the top of world football.\n<p>Two Spain-based German internationals were certainly given food for thought.\n<p>Mesut Ozil and Sami Khedira were both anonymous during Madrid’s no-show at the Westfalenstadion.\n<p>Spain have ruled the international roost for the last five years, winning two European Championships and a first World Cup crown in addition to a continental title at under-21 level.\n<p>Vicente del Bosque’s team may have reigned supreme, but Germany have also enjoyed admirable consistency.\n<p>The Germans have reached three semifinals and the Euro 2008 final in the last four major tournaments.\n<p>With Low agonizing over how best to push Die Mannschaft over the finishing line, the key might just lie with some of the talent rising through the ranks.\n<p>Both Bayern and Dortmund played with an intensity and purpose which made tiki-taka look dated and pedestrian.\n<p>Euro 2012, won by Spain after an emphatic 4-0 win over Italy in the final, was a first major championship for Gotze, Rues, Hummels and Gundagon.\n<p>Two years wiser, and possibly with Champions League winner’s medal in their back pockets, the young quartet might provide the spark which fires a German World Cup triumph in Brazil. \n<br> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/cnniworldsport.wordpress.com/9077/\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/cnniworldsport.wordpress.com/9077/\" border=\"0\"></a> <img height=\"1\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=worldsport.blogs.cnn.com&blog=8188608&post=9077&subd=cnniworldsport&ref=&feed=1\" border=\"0\"><img height=\"1\" width=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/rss/edition_worldsportblog/~4/SzJcs-fpxlQ\">","direction":"ltr"},"title":"Is the Champions League a prelude to German World Cup triumph?","published":1367332311000,"alternate":[{"href":"http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_worldsportblog/~3/SzJcs-fpxlQ/","type":"text/html"}],"canonical":[{"href":"http://worldsport.blogs.cnn.com/2013/04/30/is-the-champions-league-a-prelude-to-german-world-cup-triumph/","type":"text/html"}],"author":"tommcgowan","crawled":1367332311000,"origin":{"streamId":"feed/http://rss.cnn.com/rss/edition_worldsportblog.rss","htmlUrl":"http://worldsport.blogs.cnn.com","title":"CNN World Sport"},"summary":{"content":"\"Almost impossible.\" That's how former German international striker Oliver Bierhoff described the task his country face in trying to win the 2014 World Cup in Brazil.
